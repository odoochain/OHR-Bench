        "text": "IRRIGATION AND WATER SUPPLY COMMMISSION-QUEENSLAND.\n\n\nREPORT ON ST. GEORGE IRRIGATION PROJECT. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\nPurpose of Project.\n\nIn the western portions of the State there are many areas, having suitable soil, where the rainfall is insufficient for intensive cultivation, and the possibility of irrigation has long been contemplated. The topography of the country precludes the construction of large storage reservoirs, so that irrigation must necessarily be limited to small projects subject to the economic disadvantages usually associated with small enterprises.\n\nAs early as 1889 it had been proposed to conserve water by building a series of weirs on the Balonne River between Dalby and St. George, but this idea was abandoned when surveys showed that only very small storages, not exceeding 2,000 acre feet, could be constructed along that section of the stream.\n\nThe greater width of the stream in the vicinity of St. George presented more favourable conditions for storages which moreover would impound the waters of both the Balonne and the Maranoa Rivers. During the last thirty years, a number of irrigation schemes have been proposed and these are enumerated in Part I. of this report.\n\nWeir at St. George.\n\nThere has recently been completed at St. George a combined concrete bridge and weirthe Jack Taylor Weir-for the primary purposes of providing a road crossing of the Balonne River and a water supply for the town. The weir, which has a maximum height above the stream bed of 18 feet, impounds 3,900 acre feet of water, which is far in excess of that required for water supply to the town. Provision has been made for the installation of sluice gates upon the crest of the weir to raise the water level by 4 feet and increase the storage to 6,400 acre feet. Some strengthening of the weir will permit of raising the water level by a further 2 feet, thus increasing the storage to 7,450 acre feet.\n\nWithout practical experience with small isolated irrigation areas in the drier parts of the State, the building of a large weir with the intention of using the surplus water for irrigation was, as stated by the then Premier, the late Hon. E. M. Hanlon, M.L.A., at the inaugural ceremony on 28th April, 1948, somewhat of an experiment to discover to what extent the benefits of irrigation can be brought to the west.\n\nThe Proposed Project.\n\nDescription.\n\nThe area to be irrigated is shown red on Plan No. 2, and water pumped from the reservoir near the weir will be conveyed to it by an open channel, from which it will be distributed by gravity in smaller channels to the farms to be watered. Having regard to topography, soils, the height to which water must be pumped, and transport, the area selected is more favourably located than any other area adjacent to St. George. A drainage system will be constructed to remove both storm water and any surplus water from irrigation.\n\nThe area will be served by the Thallon-St. George main road, which traverses it, but access to farms will be by roads constructed to pioneer standard. Provision has been made also for the necessary administrative accommodation.\n\nThe proposed project is described in more detail in the following parts of this report.\n\nStage Construction.\n\nThe irrigation area will be developed in two stages. The first stage, comprising 17 farms, will correspond to the quantity of water available from the existing weir.",
        "page_idx": 8
    },
    {
        "text": "The second stage cannot be undertaken until the storage capacity of the weir is increased by installing sluice gates on the crest, but either of two alternatives may be adopted for this second stage, viz.-\n(a) Crest gates 4 feet high and 12 additional farms ; or\n(b) Crest gates 6 feet high and 20 additional farms.\n\nIf construction of Stage 1 be commenced during 1953-54, then to maintain continuity in construction, Stage 2 should be started in 1955-56. Decision as to the adoption of Stage $2 a$ or $2 b$ or either of them need not be made immediately, but the pump well and main channel will be built at the outset of sufficient capacity for Stage $2 b$.\n\nLand Usage.\n\nThe gross area of each farm has been fixed at 300 acres and each farm will be allotted a water right of 140 acre feet per year, but in normal years, when full supply is available, a farmer will be permitted to purchase an additional 30 per cent.-that is, 42 acre feet-at the same price per acre foot, thus bringing his total supply up to 182 acre feet for the year.\n\nIn consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Stock, careful consideration has been given to the most suitable type of farming. A settler will be free to grow whatever crops he pleases, but it has been assumed for the purpose of this report that farms will be developed initially upon a cotton-fodder basis with wheat and a few sheep as a sideline. The water available in normal years will suffice for 40 acres of cotton and 42 acres of perennial pasture and also permit one irrigation of fallow for 100 acres of wheat.\n\nAlthough the cotton-fodder combination appears to offer the better return, especially until settlers become well established, it must be borne in mind that St. George is in a sheepraising area and it is anticipated that settlers may successfully change over to fat lamb and wool production.\n\nThe number of farms available upon completion of each stage of the project and the estimated production therefrom are set out in Table A.\n\nEconomics of Project.\n\nThe total cost of the weir was $£ 120,000$, but portion of this would have had to be expended to provide a water supply for St. George. The additional expenditure due to raising the weir for irrigation is estimated to be $£ 45,000$. Since this expenditure has already been incurred, it has not been taken into account in examining the economics of the new project.\n\nThe estimated capital expenditure, annual expenditure on operation, maintenance, and management, and revenue at the completion of each stage of the project is given in Table A. The estimate of revenue has been based upon a water right charge at the rate of $£ 2$ per acre foot delivered to the farm ; an annual drainage rate of 7 s . per acre; and an annual land rental at the rate of 2 s .6 d . per acre. It is now the usual practice in financing irrigation schemes to assume that the capital cost of bringing water to the farm boundaries shall be borne by the State, but the annual cost of operation, maintenance, and management should be met out of revenue. The annual charges include the cost of pumping from the weir as well as that of operating and maintaining the channels and other irrigation works. It is evident from Table A that Stage 1 and the larger alternative Stage $2 b$ must be carried out before revenue can be expected to meet annual charges. Moreover it is anticipated that for the first year only one-third and for the second year two-thirds of the normal water right charge can be imposed upon a settler, so there will be a lag in revenue resulting in an accumulated deficit which will not be extinguished until the twelfth year of operation.\n\nIt has been estimated that in Victoria two-fifths of the value of increased production accrues to the Commonwealth and State Governments directly as water and drainage charges and indirectly in fares, freights, and other charges. Assuming that similar conditions obtain in Queensland and that the indirect return to the State Government is one-fifth of the value of increased production, it represents a return upon capital invested of 11.5 per cent. upon completion of Stage $2 b$.\n\nFurther Development.\n\nFurther development is possible by building another weir at the 13 Mile Rocks upstream from St. George. From this point it is possible to convey water by gravity to irrigate land adjacent to that included in the project now proposed. More surveys and investigations will be necessary to determine whether such further development is economically feasible.\n\nCost of Establishing Farms and Returns Therefrom.\n\nThe project appears to be a good one for a satisfactory settler who has not less than $£ 2,000$ to start with. The maximum amount which he will require to borrow in the third year will then be well within the $£ 7,500$ which the Agricultural Bank is empowered to advance.",

        "text": "PART I.-HISTORICAL.\n\nAs early as 1889 it was proposed to conserve water by constructing a series of weirs on the Balonne River between Dalby and St. George, but this proposal was abandoned after surveys had shown that only small storages, not exceeding 2,000 acre feet, could be constructed along that section of the stream.\n\nThe greater width of the channel in the vicinity of St. George offered more favourable conditions for storages which would impound the waters of both the Balonne and Maranoa Rivers, having a combined catchment area of 27,000 square miles.\n\nIrrigation in the St. George district was contemplated at least as early as 1922, when B. E. Shaw, Assistant Engineer, Hydraulic Engineer's Department, carried out an investigation and selected three possible sites for weirs (Plan No. 2), viz.-\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { A-at } 144 \\cdot 26 \\text { miles at the rocks immediately above the town; } \\\\\n& \\text { B-at } 151 \\cdot 45 \\text { miles at the } 8 \\text { Mile Rocks; } \\\\\n& \\text { C-at } 156 \\cdot 42 \\text { miles at the } 13 \\text { Mile Rocks. }\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nA relatively rapid rise in the bed of the stream for some miles upstream of B renders that site unfavourable for storage compared with sites A and C, though it would be suitable for a high diversion weir.\n\nOf six schemes outlined in the 1922 report, one (No. 4) provided for irrigation by pumping to land along the left bank of the river above St. George and the other five involved diversion of water by gravity or pumping to Thuraggi Lagoon, from whence it would be distributed to the area of land shown green on Plan No. 2.\n\nFurther consideration of these schemes was deferred until more information regarding stream flow became available. A stream-gauging station was established at St. George in 1921 and an evaporation gauge was installed in 1925.\n\nIn another report in 1930, Mr. Shaw advocated abandoning former proposals for diversion entirely by gravity either directly from a weir at C or from a diversion weir at B because they would not permit of using water stored by a weir at A and the Shire Council desired that any weir built should be sufficiently close to St. George to provide a water supply for the town. The proposals were thus reduced to two, viz.-\n\nNo. 3-comprising weirs at A and C ; a pumping plant at P delivering water through a channel about two miles long to Thuraggi Lagoon ; a regulator on Thuraggi Lagoon providing a small additional storage ; and supply thence by gravitation to the area shown green on Plan No. 2;\nNo. 4 -comprising a pumping plant at P delivering water to a channel running parallel to the river for a distance of $4 \\frac{1}{4}$ miles and supplying water by gravitation to all allotments close to the river bank in the area shown yellow on Plan No. 2.\nThe land to be irrigated under Scheme No. 4 would be the lighter levee soils, which have good drainage and are well suited for citrus or other crops, but is mostly freehold involving high cost of resumption and resubdivision.\n\nMr. Shaw advocated adoption of Scheme No. 3, because much of the area was leasehold and the land was considered to be suitable for lucerne and other crops.\n\nThere appears to have been no further action until about 1945, when the Balonne Shire Council, realising the necessity of providing a water supply for the Town of St. George and replacing the existing timber road bridge across the Balonne, engaged the services of Mr. J. Mulholland, Consulting Engineer, who submitted a report (1946) proposing a combined weir and bridge at $142 \\cdot 6$ miles almost immediately upstream of the existing timber bridge. His proposal included the alternatives of a weir 11 feet high to provide for town supply only or a weir 18 feet high intended to impound some water for irrigation also. The Council pressed for the adoption of this site, notwithstanding that the level of the stream bed was eight feet lower than at site A, because it was a convenient place for the road crossing and providing a permanent lake in front of the town, even though there may be some pollution by drainage therefrom. Subsequent surveys showed that, for the same crest level, a weir at the new site compared favourably with respect to storage capacity with one at site A. As a result of discussion between the Co-ordinator-General of Public Works and the parties interested, it was decided to build a combined weir and bridge at the 142.4 mile site.\n\nThe weir has now been built at the $142 \\cdot 6$ mile site by the Irrigation and Water Supply Commission to a design prepared by it. In its present condition the weir has a maximum height above the stream bed of 18 feet and impounds 3,900 acre feet of water. It will be possible to increase the storage capacity to 7,450 acre feet by the installation of movable crest gates which will raise the pond level by six feet.\n\nThere was not available any satisfactory experience upon which to base an investigation into the economics of small isolated irrigation areas in the drier parts of the State, and as stated by the then Premier, the Honourable E. M. Hanlon, M.L.A., at the inaugural ceremony on 28th April, 1948, the building of the weir-the first of its kind in the west-was somewhat of an experiment to discover to what extent the benefits of irrigation can be brought to the west.",

        "text": "A 1951 proposal for utilising the water to be stored by this weir was to irrigate an area of land adjacent to the left bank of the Balonne River, immediately north and east of St. George, shown edged black on Plan No. 2. Water was to be raised by electrically-driven pumps, situated approximately at X on Plan No. 2, supplied with energy from a central power station to be installed by the Balonne Shire Council. The high pumping head involved in delivering water to these levee soils, together with high cost for resumption and resubdivision, would make it necessary to grow high-priced crops, the principal crop being tobacco. Because of isolation from other tobacco areas and varying labour requirements, it was considered that the St. George area is not a suitable location for a project based upon tobacco.\n\nA soil reconnaissance of the area (Plan No. 4) to the south-east of St. George showed that the land is suited for production under irrigation of irrigated pastures for fat lamb, wool, and fodder, and sufficient area is available for the larger farms necessary for such development. Moreover, the site adopted for the weir permits of locating the pumping station at the southern end of St. George, where the height to which the water must be lifted is less than that for the former proposal. This is the area which it is now proposed to develop, but economic studies indicate that cotton-growing should be combined with the production of fat lambs and fodder.\n\nPART II.-GENERAL REPORT AND DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT.\n\nAs a result of investigations of methods of utilising the water available from the weir, now complete except for possible future installation of crest gates, this report has been prepared and includes proposals for-\n(1) The establishment of an irrigation undertaking in the St. George area to serve the area shown coloured on Plan No. 5 ;\n(2) The construction of irrigation and drainage works comprising Stage 1 of the undertaking, to serve an area of some 5,100 acres subdivided to 17 farms ; and following the preparation of detailed designs and estimates to proceed with development of Stage 2 of the undertaking comprising the installation of crest gates on the weir and the extension of irrigation and drainage works to serve a further area of not more than 6,000 acres comprising a further 20 farms;\n(3) The constitution of an Irrigation Area under the Irrigation Acts and a Drainage Area under the Water Acts, as indicated on Plan No. 5 ;\n(4) Arrangements to be made with the St. George Electricity Authority for supply of electric power to the proposed pumping station ;\n(5) Investigation of further water conservation works on the Balonne River and irrigation works in the St. George area.\n\nInformation Available.\n\nDetailed designs and estimates have been prepared for the irrigation, drainage, and other works for Stage 1 of the project and preliminary estimates for the alternative Stage 2 developments.\n\nDetailed designs and estimates of Stage 2 development will be proceeded with at an early date.\n\nDetails of the Proposed Project.*\n\n(a) Boundaries and Extent of Area.\n\nA map (Plan No. 5) shows the boundaries and extent of the lands proposed to be included in the irrigation area and served by the irrigation undertaking.\n(b) Description and Purpose of Works.\n\nThe project comprises-\n(1) Utilisation of water available from the existing weir, installation of a pumping station on the left bank of the Balonne River adjacent to the weir, and the construction of main and distributory channel systems to convey water from the pumping station to lands in the area shown on Plan No. 5 ;\n(2) Construction of drainage works to serve farms in the area for removal of storm runoff, and surplus irrigation water. The effect of these works will be to safeguard the irrigated lands from soil deterioration due to excessive soil moisture, and thus protect assets created in the water conservation, irrigation, and farm development works ;\n(3) Construction of roads to reasonable pioneer standards to serve the farms to be opened in the area ;\n(4) Office and staff accommodation as required in the area to provide for satisfactory administration and management of the project;\n* Information under this heading is set out in the form required by \" The Irrigation Acts, 1922 to 1949.\"",

The approximate area to be developed in Stage 2 is shown coloured green on Plan No. 5. Stage 2 may be either of two alternatives depending on whether the weir is raised (a) 4 feet or (b) 6 feet.\n(c) Nature and Extent of Works.\n\nStage 1-\nIrrigation works will consist of an electrically-driven pumping plant with a capacity of 22 cubic feet per second situated on the Balonne River upstream of the existing weir, which will raise water from the weir pool to the main channel shown on Plan No. 5. The main channel will convey water from the pumping station a distance of 6 miles to the area to be developed from where it will be reticulated by a system of some 10 miles of distributary channels through the area, indicated on Plan No. 5.\nChannels will be constructed so that water will flow by gravity on to the farms, no further pumping being required. All channels will be open trapezoidal-shaped earth channels, in some cases lined with clay to reduce losses by seepage where channels pass through sandy soils, and with necessary reinforced concrete regulators, outlets, and culverts to provide for control of water and access across channels. Water delivered to farms will pass through Dethridge meters which will measure all water supplied.\nDrainage works will consist of 7 miles of open earth channels, located and constructed to collect and remove surplus storm and irrigation water. Reinforced concrete structures for access across drains, prevention of scour at inlets, junctions, and drops in drains will be incorporated where required.\nAncillary works, following upon acquisition and subdivision of land, will be layout and construction of roads through the area and provision of necessary office and staff accommodation for the management and operation of the area.\nStage 2-\nIncreasing the capacity of the existing weir to 7,450 acre feet by the installation of crest gates. Irrigation, drainage, and ancillary works will be extensions to Stage 1 works located in the area shown green on Plan No. 5.\nThe capacity of the pumping station plant will be increased to 41 cubic feet per second.\n(d) Estimates of Cost.\n(i.)

The present tenure of the lands to be vested in the Commissioner is approximately 6,500 acres freehold and 7,500 acres grazing homestead lease, as shown on Plan No. 3. The value of the land to be resumed for resubdivision and settlement including improvements, is estimated to be $£ 61,000$.\n\nFor Stages 1 and $2 a$ the area to be resumed will be 11,000 acres, the estimated value of which, including improvements, is $£ 48,000$.\n\n(k) Benefits Resulting from the Development of the Project.\n\nAs indicated in paragraphs ( $e$ ) and ( $f$ ) above, it is proposed that any excess cost of operation, maintenance, and management over revenue and the interest and redemption charges on the capital costs of the works be met from Consolidated Revenue. This is considered to be justified by the indirect benefits and revenue that will result from development of the project by virtue of the value of increased production and the increased employment that will be created.\n\nIt has been estimated that in Victoria forty (40) per cent. of the value of increased production from an irrigation accrues to the Commonwealth and State Governments, either directly as water and drainage charges, or indirectly as fares, freights, and other charges. Estimates of the average value of production from the project area after full development and on the basis of cotton-fodder production farms will be-\n\n> For Stage $1-£ 130,000$\n> For Stages 1 and $2 a-£ 223,000$\n> For Stages 1 and $2 b-£ 284,000$\n\nThis would provide for the total increased return to State and Commonwealth Governments, after deduction of water and drainage charges, of amounts of $£ 44,000, £ 76,000$, and $£ 97,000$, respectively, for Stages 1,1 and $2 a$, and 1 and $2 b$, of which probably 50 per cent. will be received by the State. These amounts would provide a substantial surplus over the interest and redemption charges of $£ 19,000, £ 25,000$, and $£ 29,000$ for these stages respectively, and any excess of operation, maintenance, and management costs over revenue.",

The rainfall is well distributed throughout the year and there is no well-defined monsoonal season, although the heavier monthly falls occur from January to March.\n\nThe average annual rainfall is 19.71 inches, distributed as set out in Table 5. The table also indicates the estimated mean plant requirements, based on 70 per cent. of pan evaporation, and moisture deficiency which must be approximately made up by irrigation.\n\nTABLE 5.\nAverage Ratnfall and Moisture Requirements.\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c}\n \nMonth. & Estimated mean plant requirements. & Mean precipitation. & Estimated mean moisture deficiency. \\\\\n & Inches. & Inches. & Inches. \\\\\n \nJanuary & 7.28 & 2.60 & 4.68 \\\\\nFebruary & 6.09 & 2.41 & 3.68 \\\\\nMarch & 5.67 & 2.07 & 3.60 \\\\\nApril & 3.99 & 1.25 & 2.74 \\\\\nMay & 2.59 & 1.37 & 1.22 \\\\\nJune & 1.68 & 1.48 & 0.20 \\\\\nJuly & 1.68 & 1.31 & 0.37 \\\\\nAugust & 2.45 & 0.95 & 1.50 \\\\\nSeptember & 3.85 & 1.09 & 2.76 \\\\\nOctober & 5.53 & 1.36 & 4.17 \\\\\nNovember & 6.30 & 1.78 & 4.52 \\\\\nDecember & 7.00 & 2.04 & 4.96 \\\\\n \nTotal & 54.11 & 19.71 & 34.40 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nFrom the table it is apparent that the mean rainfall is insufficient to supply the estimated mean plant requirement during any month of the year and that the application of irrigation water is necessary if intensive agricultural development is to be obtained.\n\nStorage.\n\nThe water supply for the area is to be obtained from the Jack Taylor Weir, on the Balonne River. Construction of this weir to Crest R.L. 630 with a storage of 3,900 acre feet has been completed with the exception of installation of sluice gates.\n\nThe design of the weir provides for an increase in storage capacity to 6,140 or 7,450 acre feet by fitting of steel gates 4 to 6 feet high on the crest of the weir.\n\nWater Availability.\n\nUsing the estimated monthly percentages of irrigation demand given in Table 7, the water available from the storage in normal years has been determined and is set out in Table 6.\n\nTABLE 6.\nAvailability of Water-Jack Taylor Weir.\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n \nStage. & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}Storage. & \\multicolumn{3}{|c}Water available. \\\\\n \n& Crest R.L. & Capacity. & At pumping stations. & At farms. \\\\\n \n&  & (Acre feet.) & (Acre feet.) & (Acro feet.) \\\\\n1 & 630 & 3,900 & 4,460 & 3,122 \\\\\n1 and 2a & 634 & 6,140 & 7,600 & 5,320 \\\\\n1 and 2b & 636 & 7,450 & 9,750 & 6,820 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nDuring the 30 years of records, from 1922 to 1951, each farm in both stages would have been supplied with 182 acre feet ( 130 per cent.

Water Right) would have been supplied. Only once during the period of records would less than 182 acre feet per farm have been supplied in more than two successive yearsthis would have occurred in 1930-32, during which period an average supply of 168 acre feet per farm could have been made. The estimated storage behaviour for Stages 1 and $2 a$ is shown in Plan No. 6, and for Stages 1 and $2 b$ on Plan No. 7.\n\nIn determining the water available for irrigation development, minimum storages of 400 and 700 acre feet for Stages 1 and 1 and 2 respectively have been allowed to satisfy water requirements for the town of St. George, private diversions for irrigation from the Weir pool, and riparian rights to landholders downstream of the weir.",

Construction at a lower level to avoid deep cutting would require costly flood protection works.\n(3) At times of high flood, overflow from the Maranoa River passes through the area.\n(4) The area is more heavily timbered and topography is not as satisfactory due to a large area of \"melon-hole\" country, and farm development costs would be greater.\n\nSoil and Topography.\n\nA preliminary soil survey of the area has been carried out by officers of the Bureau of Investigation and a preliminary topographical survey by officers of this Commission. Details of these surveys are shown on Plan No. 4. A detailed topographical survey of the area is now almost complete.\n\nThe predominant soil types are a dark-grey brown silty clay which cracks deeply and a self-mulching brown clay with occasional small patches of sand. In the main, the area is open grassland with light patches of coolibah and box timber.\n\nThe prevailing topography shows a general fall to the south. The area is intersected by minor depressions which form natural drainage lines, and, as far as possible, the drainage system has been designed to follow these depressions.\n\nThe area is reasonably flat and even and considered suitable for irrigation by furrow or border check methods. It is not anticipated that there will be any flooding of the area from the Balonne River, even with peak floods of similar magnitude to that of 1950.\n\nLand Use.\n\nExisting Land Use.\n\nPresent land use in the area is for wool production. During flush seasons some grazing of cattle is practised but wool production still predominates.\n\nProposed Land Use.\n\nIn planning development of the area, it has been assumed that ultimately its prime function will be wool and fat lamb production from irrigated pastures.\n\nEach settler will be free to select the type of production he considers most suitable, but it has been assumed in this report that initially farms will be developed on a cotton-fodder production basis with wheat and a small number of sheep as a sideline. Ultimately it is felt that farms may turn to fat lamb and wool production and provision for such has been made in fixing farm sizes.\n\nFor cotton-fodder production the annual land utilisation under irrigation has been assumed as 40 acres for cotton, 42 acres perennial pastures, and one irrigation of fallow for 100 acres of wheat. For fat-lamb and wool production annual land utilisation under irrigation is expected to be about 115 acres- 75 acres under annual pastures and 40 under perennial pastures.\n\nFarm Sizes and Water Allocation.\n\nIn determining farm sizes, allowance has been made for ultimate development on wool and fat-lambs production. The gross area of each farm has been fixed at 300 acres, which is considered suitable for this form of production under irrigation.\n\nIt is proposed that a water right of 140 acre feet be allotted to each farm with allowance for the supply of an additional 30 per cent. as sales, thus setting the total water supplied to any farm in a normal year at 182 acre feet.\n\nWater Requirements.\nAnnual water requirements for the various types of plantings are estimated to be-",

The gross area of farms is considered as being about 80 per cent. of the area covered by the irrigation works, \\&c., the balance being required for channel, drain, and road reserves and areas of unsuitable topography or soils.\n\nTABLE 8.\nNumbers of Farms and Areas Commanded.\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n \nStage. & Farms. & Area of farms.\\\\\n \n& No. & Acres.\\\\\n1 & 17 & 5,100\\\\\n2a & 12 & 3,600\\\\\n2b & 20 & 6,000\\\\\n1 and 2a & 29 & 8,700\\\\\n1 and 2b & 37 & 11,100\\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nStage Development.\nAs the construction of the storage works is being carried out in two stages, irrigation development is being planned on similar lines.\n\nAnother feature making stage development desirable is the present limited practical experience of water usage and desirable irrigation methods and practice for the area. Following Stage 1 development, some revision of estimated water requirements for particular crops may be found necessary, and can then be readily effected before water is allocated from the increased storage which will be available.\n\nLand Resumptions and Subdivision.\n\nA complete resubdivision will involve almost complete resumption of lands within the area and it is proposed that such resumptions will be carried out under the provisions of the Irrigation Acts. Existing land tenures are shown on Plan No. 3.\n\nProvision has been made in the estimates of capital cost for land resumptions.",
