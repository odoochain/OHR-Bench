INTRODUCTION.\n\nIn this paper are set forth the results obtained by collecting in the calcareous beds of the Bernician or Lower Carboniferous series of Northumberland. The work, which occupied the greater part of a year (1907-8), had for its object an inquiry into the faunal succession of the Upper Bernician.\n\nThe scheme adopted for zoning was that used by Dr. Arthur Vaughan in his work on the Carboniferous Limestone formation of the South-West Province, and successfully applied by subsequent workers to other Carboniferous areas in Britain.",

Lebour and Dr. Vaughan, to Prof, Lebour for his advice and encouragement whilst carrying out the field-work, and to Dr. Vaughan for determining the corals and for other valuable assistance. My thanks are also due to Dr. Wheelton Hind for naming the lamellibranchs, and to several members of H.M. Geological Survey, namely to Dr. Traquair for identifying the fish remains, to Dr. Kitchin and to Mr. R. G. Carruthers. Lastly I must express my great obligation to Mr. John Dunn, formerly of Redesdale, for allowing me access to his valuable collection of Redesdale fossils-the result of many years' careful collecting.\n\nII.\n\nTHE BERNICIAN SERIES.\n\nThe Bernician series forms the upper, and by far the larger, division of the Lower Carboniferous sequence of Northumberland, and covers the greater part of the county. It is divisible into two groups, the upper or Calcareous Division and the lower or Carbonaceous Division. Below the Bernician strata lie the Tuedian beds, including under the term the Fell Sandstone series and the Cementstone group. The Northumberland succession, together with the Lower Carboniferous rocks north of the Tweed, occupies the northern extremity of the Carboniferous Limestone tract, which stretches from Lancashire and Yorkshire into Scotland.\n\nThe Carboniferous strata in Northumberland encircle the Cheviots on the south, east, and north, and dip from the volcanic inlier, so that the general strike forms a rough semicircle round the igneous massif, nearest to which consequently lie the lowest beds. (See map.) In the south and east, the strata may be followed as continuous outcrops. In the districts round the volcanic inlier faulting has entirely destroyed the continuity of strike, but in the north it has spread out the scattered and repeated outcrops into belts, which run in the same direction as the general strike.",

        "text": "The thickness of the Carboniferous Limestone series in Northumberland is difficult to estimate on account of excessive faulting and also owing to the great variations in thickness displayed by different members. It is probable that one division increases locally at the expense of another. The following figures given by members of H.M. Survey and others afford some idea regarding the thicknesses and variations of the groups; but they are only approximate.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[b]{2}{*}{Bernician.} & \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{Tyne \\& Rede.} & \\multirow[b]{2}{*}{Coquet.} & \\multirow[b]{2}{*}{Tweed.} \\\\\n  & & & \\\\\n  Calcareous Division & 4000? & ? & 1700 \\\\\n  Carbonaceous Division & 2500 & Thin. & 900 \\\\\n  Tuedian. & & & \\\\\n  Fell Sandstone Series & 600 & 2000 & 600 \\\\\n  Cementstone Group & 600 & 1000 & 2500 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nBetween the Coquet and the Tweed the Cementstone group thins out locally to a few hundred feet ( 300 or 400 ?).\n\nThe Bernician series is mainly built up of shales and sandstones, but interbedded among the argillaceous and arenaceous deposits are beds of limestone and coal. Calcareous horizons are found in both divisions of the series, but the beds in the upper contrast strongly with those of the lower. In the Calcareous Division the limestones are thick, truly marine, and constant, some of them traversing the whole length of the county. In the Carbonaceous they are thin and impure, and often contain rootlets of Stigmaria; a few marine limestones make their appearance in the south. It is with the upper limestones that this paper is solely concerned, and my investigations were restricted to the country north of the Tyne.\n\nSouth of Northumberland the Upper Bernician is mainly represented by the Yoredale rocks; the basal limestones, together with the Carbonaceous Division, are equivalent to",

The higher Yoredale strata disappear as they are followed southward ; till in Wharfedale the Millstone Grit comes almost immediately upon the Main ( $=$ Great) Limestone.\n\nIII.\n\nPHYSICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILING DURING THE DEPOSITION OF THE SERIES.\n\nThis series of thick detrital accumulations, containing numerous beds of coal and frequent interpolations of calcareous strata, could only have been formed in the proximity of land, and under very varying conditions, involving continuous oscillation of the sea floor and repeated change in geographical relationships. The rate of accumulation of sediment must at one period have exceeded the rate of subsidence, so that the sea became so silted up as to form a swamp in which grew the jungles that formed the coal seams. Rapid submergence followed, and these vegetable accumulations often became the floor upon which the calcareous deposits were laid down. The limestones were deposited near enough to the coast to allow frequent invasions of fine sediment, as indicated by the numerous shaly partings and interbedded shales.\n\nIV. STRATIGRAPHICAL SUBDIVISIONS.\n\nThe limestones of the Calcareous Division may be divided into three groups. The limestones above the Little Limestone, which occupy the south and east of Northumberland and which thin out towards the north, form the Upper Group ; the Middle Group comprehends those thick and continuous beds which can be followed right across the county, and includes the Great Limestone; whilst to the Lower Group belong the limestones of the Calcareous Division below the Eelwell Limestone.",
