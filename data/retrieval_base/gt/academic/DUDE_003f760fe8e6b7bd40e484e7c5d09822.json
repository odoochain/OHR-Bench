On the eighth day after vaccination, a papular and vesicular rash appeared over the trunk, which rapidly assumed a sloughing character. The eruption was at first taken for small-pox, and when death took place, a fortnight later, an inquest was held on the casc, for it was then thought to be syphilis. But Mr. Hutchinson pointed out that its evolution as well as its character were not those of syphilitic infection, and he considered it to be a true case of vaccinia passing on to a gangrenous condition-a condition he had sometimes observed to take place in varicella. The vaccine marks on the arm were natural.-Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, F.R.C.S., \\&c. The Lancit, December I3th, 1879, P. 873.\n\n\"HAD T0 BE SUSPENDED.\"\n\nJENNER had already observed phlegmonous erysipelas to follow vaccination. And in the Foundling Hospital at Petersburg, of 5,000 vaccinated infants, 57 took erysipelas in consequence of vaccination and died. Also in boston, erysipelas has been seen to follow upon vaccination ; and on various occasions vaccination has had to be suspended.-Dr. C. Spinzif, St. Louis, U.S. i 880.\n\n\"AFRAID OF THE VIRUS.\"\n\nOne pernicious practice, is that of raccinating children. I am as afraid of the virus as I am of the small-pox. Not only scrofula. but other impurities have been conveyed to the blood of healthy persons by means of vaccination. No one, who has given the subject the least consideration, doubts that impurities may be conveyed in this manner-10r. A. G. Springistefn, Cleveland, Ohio. Nér lork nicdical Trilunte, January, 1880 .\n\n\"ITS GHASTLY RISKS.\"\n\nThere has fallen an ugly blot. It is too certain that one objection really formidable does exist-that the operation may, in some few instances, impart to the subject of it the poison of a hateful and destructive disease (syphilis), peculiar to the human spectes, and the fruit and Nemesis of its vices. On this distasteful subject I shall simply appeal to the printed testimony of MR. JONATHAN Hu'libinodn. . . Such facts as he has demonstrated, eon-",

Nineteenth Century, June, 1880.\n\n\"CALF-LYMPH FATALITY.\"\n\nMr. Boyle records a case of crysipclas, followed by large ulcerated, unhealthy sores in a prcviously healthy child, at six months, following vaccination with calf lymph.-Mr. J. H. Boyle, M.B., C.M., L.M. Lancet, April 3rd, 1880 .\n\n\"ALMOST DRIVEN TO DESPAIR.\"\n\nI have now under treatment a girl who has an eruption, not unlike small-pox, on her shoulders, arms, and face, and which causes her intolerable itching. She was vaccinatcd 18 years ago, and has an eruption cvery summer of a similar kind to that which followed shortly after having been vaccinated. At these times she is greatly debilitated and looks thoroughly out of health. I have also just given up attending a gentleman who, having suffered from chronic cczema on the arms and legs, was recommended to try the experiment recorded in Dr. Joseph Kidn's book on Therapeutics (page 98), and get vaccinated with a view to cure. The result was a great increase of the disease, which almost drove him to despair. He is now nearly well. l have also seen an cruption, almost indistinguishable from small-pox, coming out on a paticnt round the site of the vaccine vesicle in a ring of several inches circumference. In this case no further harm resulted, but 1 am inclined to think that those cases which are said \"not to take\" are those in which the vital organs are most likely to be imjuriously affected.-Dr. Edward Haughton. Letter 1. The British Mcdical Fournal, Aug. 18 th , 188 o .\n\n\"THOUSANDS MORTALLY POISONED.\"\n\nSyphilis, scrofula, and probably every kind of blood poison can be taken by Vaccination, which, so far from being a protection against Small-pox, seems to have bcen one of the chicf causes of the late epidemics. It is never safe to take matter from another body into our own: we risk taking all its discascs. There is no doubt thousands have been mortally poisoned by Vaccination.-T. L. Nichols, M.D., F.A.S.

        "text": "\"CANNOT BE WARRANTED AS SAFE.\"\n\nWhen a given (animal) body is possessed by one of them, (contagious diseases) no product of that body can be warranted as safe not to convey the infection. Presumption against every part and product of the diseased body is by every one readily admitted, where there are vehement general symptoms of disease ; but it is important to know that not only in such febrile states, but even in states of chronic dyscrasy, and even at times when the dyscrasy may be giving no outward sign, the infected body may be variously infective. Thus the vaccine lymph of the syphilitic may possibly contain the syphilitic contagion in full vigour, even at moments when the patient who thus shows himself infective, has not on his own person any outward activity of syphilis. Similarly in regard to tubercular disease.-Mr. Simon, F.R.C.S. British Medical Fournal, Dec. 13th, 1879.\n\n\" MORE TO BE DREADED THAN SMALL-POX.\"\n\nIn various classes, especially in large towns, not only was there doubt whether vaccination was effectual as a prevention, but there was an exceedingly great fear that diseases even more to be dreaded than small-pox itself were conveycd by vaccine matter.Dr. Brewer, M.P. House of Commons.\n\n\" MORE EVIL THAN GOOD.\"\n\nI have, in a forty years practice, seen far more evil than gob from vaccination, and therefore vaccinated my own children only in their third and fourth years, when they were hearty and strong.
