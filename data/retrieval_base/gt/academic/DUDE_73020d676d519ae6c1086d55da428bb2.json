        "text": "A BRIEF MENTAL HEALTH INDEX ${ ^{1}$\n}\n\n\nE. K. ERIC GUNDERSON and RANSOM J. ARTHUR\n\n\nNavy Medical Neuropsychiatric Research Unit, San Diego, California\n\n\nThe Cornell Medical Index (CMI) was administered to 630 Navy psychiatric patients and 454 healthy controls. Patient and control samples were split into two groups for cross-validation purposes, and two methods, regression analysis and a new item selection technique called SEQUIN, were applied to the problem of selecting the most discriminating set of CMI items. The percentages correctly classified \"sick\" or \"well\" when results from Sample 1 were used to predict Sample 2 and vice versa were $82 \\%$ and $85 \\%$ by the regression method and $86 \\%$ and $86 \\%$ by the SEQUIN method. Seven items, perhaps representing general attributes defining mental illness in the Navy culture, contributed significantly to the predictive scales regardless of particular item selection method or sample.\n\n\nThe Cornell Medical Index (CMI) has been widely used as an aid to clinical diagnosis (Brodman, Erdmann, \\& Wolff, 1956; Erdmann, 1959) and as a measure of the prevalence of somatic and emotional symptoms in various populations (Abramson, Terespolsky, Brook, \\& Kark, 1965). The Index has repeatedly demonstrated validity as an indicator of general health or of emotional health when compared with clinical ratings, but has proved less useful as an indicator of the presence of specific diseases or in comparing health status in different populations and cultures (Abramson, 1966). In a previous study of the Navy population, the total CMI score (the number of \"yes\" responses over the entire 195 -item health questionnaire) discriminated efficiently between psychiatric inpatients and healthy controls using a cutting score of 15 (Arthur, Gunderson, \\& Richardson, 1966). This result suggested that the CMI might have potential value as a psychiatric screening device and as an epidemiological tool in the Navy setting.\n\nThe next logical step in developing a useful screening index was to identify the specific\n\n\n${ ^{1}$ Report No. 67-18, supported by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Navy Department, under Research Work Unit MF 022.01.03-9002.

It seemed plausible that a short scale of highly selected items might be devised which could discriminate mentally ill from healthy individuals in the Navy population as well as the entire CMI inventory.\n\nMethod\n\nSubjects\n\nThe Ss for the study were 630 psychiatric inpatients from two naval hospitals and a normal control group of 454 enlisted men who were currently on active duty and were not medical or psychiatric patients at the time of the study. The control group consisted of students from an electronics technicians school, Marine guards, hospital corpsmen, and Navy enlisted men from several occupational categories on duty at a West Coast naval station, and participants in underwater demolition training. The mean ages of the patient group and the control group were 22 yr . and 21 yr ., respectively. Distributions in pay grade (rank) were approximately the same for both patients and controls, although seamen recruits were represented in the patient group but not in the control group.\n\nProcedure\n\nCMI questionnaires were administered individually or in groups by medical personnel at the various facilities included in the study. The total sample of 1,084 patients and controls as divided into two subgroups for purposes of cross-validation by sorting on odd or even last digits of service numbers. By this method, 560 cases were selected for Sample I, of whom 335 were patients and 225 were controls. The composition of Sample II was 295 patients and 229 controls, for a total of 524 Ss.",

These items correlated positively with the criterion, but in combination with the entire set of significant items they received negative regression weights for the prediction of the patient-control criterion. The fact that none of the negative (suppressor) weights were replicated in the other sample would recommend caution in interpreting these results.\n\nItems selected by the SEQUIN method and their correlations with the criterion for Samples I and II are shown in Table 2. All but five of the items selected by the SEQUIN method also had been selected by the regression method in at least one sample. Thus, the item content of the scales derived by the two methods was quite similar.\n\nMultiple or cumulative correlations and cross-validation results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Fifteen items significantly contributed to discrimination of patients from controls in Sample I by the regression method.\n\nA multiple correlation of .69 was achieved with this set of items against the illness criterion. When the regression weights in Sample I were used to predict \"well\" versus \"sick\" status for Sample II, a cross-validity coefficient of .69 was obtained. Regression weights for 12 significant items were derived from Sample II in order to predict patient-control status for $S$ s in Sample I.

The percentages classified correctly, that is, \"sick\" or \"well,\" were $82 \\%$ and $85 \\%$ by the regression method and $86 \\%$ and $86 \\%$ by the SEQUIN method.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe development of a short, self-administered mental health index which provides a reasonable approximation of the results of a brief psychiatric examination would have obvious importance for both research and practice. Opportunities for comparative studies of populations using clinical examination methods are extremely limited, and investigations of prevalence of symptoms and ill-\nness almost always must rely upon $\\mathrm{Ss}^{\\prime}$ own reports of health status. Important relationships of personality, cultural, and environmental factors to emotional illness and invalidism can be readily adduced by means of survey methods if valid questionnaire techniques can be devised.\nIn military psychiatric practice, decisions concerning fitness for military duty or the need to hospitalize often must be made rapidly and without the benefits of extended clinical study. A standardized screening instrument obviously could have value in settings with rapid patient turnover, for example, an outpatient clinic, where allocation of the psychiatrist's or physician's time is an important consideration. Also, the specific questions identified as most significant in differentiating \"sick\" from \"well\" individuals may suggest particularly useful areas to be explored in brief clinical interviews because these items have a clearly demonstrated relevance for estimating the probability of mental illness.\n\nThe findings of the present study are viewed as encouraging with respect to the possibility of developing a brief but efficient mental health index for the Navy population. It is clear that selection of items by linear multiple regression or similar techniques can provide great economies in scoring the present CMI questionnaire and at the same time slightly increase validity as well. Scoring only from 12 to 15 items by means of regression weights or unit weights resulted in concurrent validities consistently higher than those attained with scores based on unit weights for all 195 items in a previous study. ${ }^{2}$ Splithalf cross-validation results indicated high stability and comparability for the various brief predictor scales obtained.\n\nThe apparent superiority of the SEQUIN method of item selection for scale cross-validations suggests that simple counting of diagnostic answers (\"yes\") would be preferable\n\n\n${ ^{2}$ When scores based upon all 195 items were dichotomized at 15 and were correlated with a sickwell criterion, a concurrent validity coefficient (phi) of .65 was attained. Details concerning the discriminating power of scores based upon the entire 195 -item CMI were given in the study by Arthur et al. (1966).\n}",

        "text": "to more complex differential weighting procedures in scoring a mental health index. This simplicity of scoring would offer pracfical advantages for many clinical settings.\nA large proportion of the items included in the various experimental scales was drawn from Sections M-R of the CMI questionnaire. These items were designed to elicit psychological symptoms, and it is not surprising that they are the most discriminating with respect to mental illness. Three items from Section L-items usually not scored as emotional symptoms-also were highly significant correlates of diagnosed mental disorder. These items-\"Do you usually have great difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep?\" \"Do you smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day?\" and \"Do you drink more than six cups of coffee or tea a day?\"-should be included in scales designed to estimate mental health status in the naval population.\n\nSeven \"universal\" items emerged from the various analyses; that is, items which contributed significantly to the predictive scales regardless of particular item-selection method or sample. These questions perhaps represent a set of general attributes which are most important in defining mental illness in the Navy culture. The items, in order of importance, are, \"Does worrying continually get you down?\" \"Are you considered a nervous person?\" \"Do you smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day?\" \"Do you suffer badly from frequent severe headaches?\" \"Are you definitely underweight?\" \"Were you ever a patient in a mental hospital (for your nerves)?\" \"Do you need glasses to read?\" These items appear to offer a useful nucleus of questions for a brief psychiatric index. Other questions could be added as their relevance was consistently demonstrated.\n\nUsing different methods of item selection, Abramson et al. (1965) devised a scale of 10 \"key\" CMI items (Hebrew version) which\ncorrelated highly ( $r=.63$ ) with physicians' ratings of emotional health in a randomly selected sample of Jerusalem males. Seven of these 10 key items appeared in the experimental scales of the present study, suggesting a surprising generality in the present findings.\n\nStudies of the relationships of brief mental health index scores to psychiatrists' decisions concerning fitness for duty and need for hospitalization are in progress, and the effects of social and cultural differences upon healthquestionnaire responses also are being evaluated.\n\nBecause the predictive value of the brief, CMI scales derived in this study has not yet been tested, the accuracy and usefulness of these scoring techinques for diagnostic purposes with new or suspected patients remain to be demonstrated, and they obviously should not be used for intake screening until such verification can be achieved.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbramson, J.
