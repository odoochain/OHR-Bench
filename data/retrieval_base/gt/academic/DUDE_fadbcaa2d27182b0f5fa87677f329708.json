        "text": "Short Synopsis\n\nTriple Divide is Public Herald's first investigations into inevitable, negative impacts from shale gas industrial development and how those impacts are handled by the state, specifically the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).\n\nNarrated with help from actor and solutions advocate Mark Ruffalo, major findings include stark negligence and endangerment of public and environmental health due to shale gas extraction. Through personal stories, expert interviews, and investigation of state case files, Triple Divide tells a cautionary tale about a public agency meant to protect the public and environment that is instead protecting industry.\n\nThough extraction of shale gas will one day end, taking many 'boom and bust' jobs with it, contaminated groundwater aquifers, polluted land, and stories of victimization will remain. Pennsylvanians, fed up with corruption and destruction, won't 'go down' without a fight and are learning how to protect themselves.\n\nFull Synopsis\n\nTriple Divide is the truth behind shale gas extraction in Pennsylvania, part of an ongoing report by investigative news nonprofit, Public Herald.\n\nNarrated with help from actor and solutions advocate Mark Ruffalo, Triple Divide reveals how inevitable, negative impacts from shale gas extraction are being handled by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the public agency charged with permitting industrial development in pristine watersheds and peaceful backyards while protecting people and the environment.\n\nThrough personal stories, expert interviews, and DEP case files, Public Herald's 18-month investigation discovered recurring impacts: contaminated water, air, and land; intimidation and harassment; loss of property, investments, and standard of living; weak and under enforced state regulations; community disruption; destruction of the public trust; illness; fragmentation of Pennsylvania's last stands of core forest; and lack of protection over basic human rights.\n\nThough shale gas development will one day end, taking jobs with it, contaminated groundwater aquifers, environmental damage, and victim stories will remain. Pennsylvanians living in the shale fields have a new name for the state DEP - Don't",

Indeed, the agency's modus of operandi is clearly 'permit first' and 'figure the rest out later.'\n\nThe documentary is named after one of only four triple continental divides in North America. Known as the Triple Divide, from it everything is downstream. At this peak in northern Pennsylvania, rain from one storm travels to three separate sides of the continent - the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada, the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern seaboard, and the Gulf of Mexico. This vast water basin is drained by three major rivers the Allegheny, the Genesee, and the Susquehanna.\n\nTriple Divide headwaters don't just feed the largest area of Exceptional Value (specially regulated) water bodies in the state; they also feed part of the state's largest stand of primitive forest - one of the last great wildernesses. These forested waterways rank among the most coveted trout streams in the United States, helping to create a sustainable tourism economy upon which locals have depended for generations.\n\nForested watersheds also provide $80 \\%$ of Pennsylvania's drinking water.\nToday, these Wilds of Pennsylvania are being divided in many ways by shale gas industrialization, made possible by a new form of an old technology, commonly known as 'fracking.' Despite the powerlessness felt by some living in the shale fields, others see the current devastation as an opportunity to reacquainted residents with what's most important, stand up the world's largest industry, and map a better future for Pennsylvania and everyone downstream.",

        "text": "Directors' Statements\n\nJoshua B. Pribanic, Co-Director\n\nI started Triple Divide to bridge the information on energy development in Pennsylvania, using water as a central theme and cultural resource for the state. The film and its shape transformed and became more closely connected to a dialogue of trust. Citizens of the Commonwealth had trusted their state agencies to protect them from the harms of industry, but the ever-building momentum and urgency of natural gas development strengthened at the expense of basic human rights.\n\nTriple Divide reveals a failure in state regulations and\n corporate responsibility to our most primeval resource, water. The combination of these things leads to the worst Tragedy of the Commons we've ever faced as a civilization, threatening large-scale contamination of drinking water supplies. So I left my native soils of Ohio in search of the truth, came to Pennsylvania with a camera in hand, and began telling the stories of Triple Divide, my first big step as a filmmaker.\n\nThank you to the courageous people who willingly unsheathed their stories for the world to see. Without them we are blindfolded.\n\nMelissa Troutman, Co-Director\n\n\nFor me, most of Triple Divide wrote itself -- swept me along with it like a river. The story is the same whether you're covering fracking, health care, or modern warfare - profit over people. Money walks.\n\nI'm from Potter County, Pa., home of the triple continental divide. Once I noticed problems with fracking there as a reporter, and realized 100,000+ more wells are slated for the state with no plan, no health or environmental impact surveys - no other story mattered.\n\nDespite it being the biggest threat to the state's long-term sustainability, media across the state either promoted or fell silent (usually when the industry ads started rolling in). So, the industry came after the loudest reporter in the state at the time (2011) - me. Shortly after, I met Joshua Pribanic and we formed Public Herald, dedicated to journalism in the public interest.\n\nTriple Divide is our first major investigation. It is my sincere hope that this film will make us all take a hard, honest look at the true, long-term costs of fracking and the desperate need for investigative journalism.",

Public Herald files a report the following morning with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation \\& Natural Resources, and asks for documents to be distributed to local drillers explaining the rights of the public in state forests.
