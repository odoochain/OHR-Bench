Although these provincial chiefs are sometimes promoted to the central government or transferred to other provinces, this distributional norm was strictly in force at the time the Central Committee was initially elected.\n\nThose who were eliminated or scored poorly in the multi-candidate election for membership of the Central Committee at the party congress were usually princelings and leaders known for their \"helicopter-like rise\" that resulted from strong patron-client ties. However, the selection of the most important leadership bodies, such as the PSC and the Politburo, still comes about through the traditional \"black-box\" manipulation on the part of either departing PSC members or powerful retired leaders such as former party chief Jiang Zemin. These contradictory trends were particularly evident in the leadership formation of the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress.\n\nThe leadership change at the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress primarily followed the extant rules and norms regarding age limits, and all members and alternates of the previous Central Committee who were born in or before 1944 no longer serve on the new Central Committee. As a result, the turnover rates in important leadership organs selected at the congress are remarkably high. Chart 1 (next page) shows that newcomers comprise 64 percent of the Central Committee (the leadership body made up of the most important national, provincial, and military leaders in the country), 77 percent of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI, the country's top anti-corruption agency), 86 percent of the Secretariat (the crucial CCP organ that handles daily administrative affairs of the country, decides top leaders' activities, and sets the agenda before major meetings), 60 percent of the Politburo, 71 percent of the PSC, and both 64 percent of all members and 70 percent of military members of the CMC.\n\nThis much-anticipated leadership transition was supposed to constitute a generational change of the top leadership in the CCP-from the fourth generation of leaders, who were mostly born in the 1940s and completed their college education prior to the Cultural Revolution, to the fifth generation of leaders, the majority of whom were born in the 1950s and lived their formative years during the Cultural Revolution. Ironically, however, CCP Secretary General Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang - the youngest members of the PSC formed at the 17th Party Congress over five years ago-have remained the youngest members of this latest PSC selected at the 18th Party Congress. Xi and Li are the only two leaders in the new PSC who were born in the 1950s (see table 1, on page 4). Xi and Li are now surrounded by five new members of the 18th PSC who are roughly three to five years younger than outgoing top leaders Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. The average age of the 18th PSC is 63.4, which is older than the average age (62.3) of the 17th PSC.\n\nThe incomplete nature of this generational leadership transition reveals that there has been a lengthy, constant, and excessive power struggle at the top. This intense elite contention reflects the strong desire for many senior leaders to stay in power-even if their victory comes at the expense of the Party's ability to present to the country a fresh new leadership team for the next decade. The poor representation of the fifth generation in the PSC will likely also increase the political anxiety and resentment of the younger generations of elites. Due to age limits, five of the seven members of the PSC will retire at the $19^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress that will take place in 2017. In a sense, the recent leadership change at the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Party",

Apparently, the upcoming round of vicious fighting for seats on the PSC will begin much earlier than expected. In fact, it has likely already begun.\n\nIn terms of gender, ethnicity, and birthplace of the members of the Politburo, for the first time since the $13^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress in 1987, there are now two female members (Vice Premier Liu Yandong and Tianjin Party Secretary Sun Chunlan) serving on the Politburo. There were no female members in the $13^{\\text {th }}$ and $14^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo (1992), and only one in the $15^{\\text {th }}, 16^{\\text {th }}$, and $17^{\\text {th }}$ Politburos (Vice Premier Wu Yi for the first two and State Councillor Liu Yandong for the $17^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo). Most of the previous Politburos since the founding of the PRC included at least one ethnic minority representative; the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo, in contrast, lacks an ethnic minority member. Fifteen leaders who were born in the eastern region dominate the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo, including four from Jiangsu and three each from Shanghai, Anhui, and Shandong; together they constitute 60 percent of total membership. No current Politburo member was born in Guangdong, China's most populous province with over 100 million residents. There are also no members who were born in China's populous southwest region (including Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guizhou).",

Jiang's protégés (especially the princelings and Shanghai Gang) and Hu's protégés (especially the tuanpai leaders) are both well represented in the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo. One of the three exceptions is Executive Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Fan Changlong, whose factional affiliation is not entirely clear (although many analysts consider him as a member of the Hu camp). The other two are director of the General Office of the CCP Central Committee Li Zhanshu and director of the Organization Department Zhao Leji, both of whom seem to have strong ties with both the Jiang camp and the Hu camp.\n\nProvincial Leadership Experience: A Key Credential for Politburo Membership\n\nProvincial or municipal leadership experience, especially the credential of serving as party secretary in China's 31 province-level administrations, has long been seen as an important stepping-stone for China's national leaders. The same is true for those selected for the 18th PSC and Politburo. Six of the seven PSC members have served as provincial chiefs (party secretary, governor, or mayor of the 31 province-level administrations) before ascending to the supreme decision-making body. The sole exception is Executive Member of the Secretariat Liu Yunshan, who, although never having served as a provincial chief, did serve as deputy party secretary of Inner Mongolia.\n\nAs shown in chart 2, there has been an increase over the past 20 years in Politburo members with provincial chief experience: beginning at 50 percent in 1992, the rate rose to 59 percent in 1997, 67 percent in 2002, and then to 76 percent in both 2007 and 2012. More than threequarters of current Politburo members ( 19 out of 25 members) have provincial chief leadership experience. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang both served as party secretaries in two provincial administrations (Xi in Zhejiang and Shanghai, and Li in Henan and Liaoning). The provincial leadership experience of Zhang Dejiang is even broader than his colleagues on the PSC: he has served as provincial chief in four provincial administrations (Jilin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Chongqing).\n\nIn what appears to be an emerging political norm, the party secretaries of the four major cities that are under the direct leadership of the central government-Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing-are apparently now entitled to seats on the Politburo. This also seems the case for Guangdong Province, where three current PSC or Politburo members (Zhang Dejiang, Wang Yang, and Hu Chunhua) have currently or previously served as Party boss. Two other PSC members, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli, also served as vice governor of Guangdong Province earlier in their careers.\n\nA majority (52 percent) of current Politburo members obtained their seats in November 2012 while serving as party secretaries in provincial administration, a much higher rate than the corresponding 22.7 percent in the $14^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo, 20.8 percent in the $15^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo, and 40 percent in both the $16^{\\text {th }}$ and $17^{\\text {th }}$ Politburos (see table 2, next page). The high representation of local leaders in both the PSC and Politburo reflects the growing power and influence of top politicians of the country's 31 provincial administrations, especially major cities and big provinces such as Guangdong.

        "text": "Local demand for an even distribution of membership seats across provinces and regions in both the Central Committee and the Politburo has become increasingly institutionalized. Although provincial and municipal leaders in economically advanced coastal regions were chosen for more seats in the new Politburo, their advantage is far less evident on the Central Committee, for which membership seats are more evenly distributed as previously discussed. In an important way, the dynamics and tensions among local leaders and between the center and provinces in terms of elite selection contribute to a more pluralistic and collective leadership in the country.\n\nThe End of Technocrat Dominance\n\nA primary explanation for the ability of the CCP to retain power (and especially to survive in the wake of the recent waves of collapse of other authoritarian regimes) is the rapid circulation of its elite members that has occurred over the past three decades. Under the direction of Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s, the CCP made great efforts to recruit \"new blood,\" especially members with technical rather than ideological expertise, into the party leadership. This \"technocratic turnover\"-as analysts have called the rapid rise of engineers-turned-politicians-occurred during the $14^{\\text {th }}$ and $15^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congresses. ${ }^{3}$ The CCP actually reformed its leadership from one consisting of peasants and soldiers during the revolutionary era to one consisting primarily of engineers during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe rapid rise-and subsequent swift decline-in power and influence of technocrats over the past three decades has been a remarkable development in Chinese elite politics. One may define technocrats as political elites who received higher education in engineering (or the natural sciences) and practiced as engineers (or engaged in scientific research). In 1982, technocrats constituted just two percent of the Central Committee, but by 1987 they made up 25 percent of the Central Committee. By 1997 they comprised over half ( 52 percent). The percentage of technocrats on the Central Committee then began to decline in 2002 (46 percent). ${ }^{4}$\n\nChart 3 (next page) shows the dramatic decline of technocrats in the Politburo and the PSC. Most interestingly, members of the $15^{\\text {th }}$ and $16^{\\text {th }}$ PSC were all trained as engineers. The representation of technocrats in the $18^{\\text {th }} \\mathrm{PSC}$ and Politburo is 14 percent and 16 percent, respectively-a sharp drop from 100 percent and 76 percent in the $16^{\\text {th }} \\mathrm{PSC}$ and Politburo 10 years earlier. In the $18^{\\text {th }} \\mathrm{PSC}$, only one member, Chairman of the CPPCC Yu Zhengsheng, held an engineering degree and practiced as an engineer earlier in his career. Among the Politburo members, only three (Beijing Party Secretary Guo Jinlong, Chongqing Party Secretary Sun Zhengcai, and Xinjiang Party Secretary Zhang Chunxian) obtained their highest degrees in natural sciences or engineering. Most of the other members hold their highest academic degrees in economics, law, politics, and the humanities.\n\nIn contrast to the fourth-generation leaders, most of whom had completed their college education (often in engineering or natural sciences) by the time the Cultural Revolution began, fifth-generation leaders were in elementary and middle school. During the Cultural Revolution the Chinese school system was largely paralyzed, with students engaged in political campaigns and ideological indoctrination rather than in academic studies. Deprived of the opportunity for formal schooling, fifth-generation leaders characteristically belong to the so-called lost generation. This age cohort suffered extraordinary hardships during",

        "text": "on for another five-year term. Among the remaining 12 candidates, some may have a better chance than others. Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang have served two terms on the Politburo, which makes them more competitive than the others. For the sake of leadership continuity beyond the $19^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress, there will be a tremendous incentive on the part of the CCP leadership to select two sixth-generation leaders as part of a dual-succession model similar to Xi and Li during the 2007 party congress. In that case, Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai are undoubtedly two leading contenders for power in the sixth generation of leaders.\n\nThe top six leaders on the list (Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Wang Yang, Li Yuanchao, Hu Chunhua, and Sun Zhengcai) seem to have a better chance to serve on the next PSC than the others. This will leave only one position open (assuming that the PSC maintains its sevenseat composition), and the competition for that position among the eight candidates will therefore be very intense. This intensity of power struggle also suggests that there will be serious challenges even to those listed among the top six, as many ambitious politicians may want to seize any opportunity to take over these highly contentious seats in the PSC.\n\nIt should be noted that the number of seats on the PSC could very well change, as the CCP Constitution does not specify a fixed number. The PSC formed at the $13^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress in 1987 had only five members, the PSCs formed at both the $14^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress in 1992 and $15^{\\text {th }}$ in 1997 had seven, and both the $16^{\\text {th }}$ and $17^{\\text {th }}$ PSCs had nine members.\n\nXinjiang Party Secretary Zhang Chunxian has often been regarded as a capable leader who gets things done. During his tenure as minister of communications from 2002 to 2005, he made significant contributions to the rapid growth of China's highways and sea transportation. While he was Hunan party secretary, the province was ranked first in the country for attracting foreign direct investment. An official with a reputation for being media savvy, Zhang has been among the most accessible leaders at the annual NPC meetings over the past decade. He is also one of the very few leaders who have pledged to make available to the public his financial asset documents (and those of his family). Zhang's \"flexible ironfisted rule\" in Xinjiang, which stands in contrast to his predecessor's \"pure iron-fisted rule,\" seems to resonate well with both the CCP leadership and the Chinese public. Zhang possesses broad leadership experience in the central government (in the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Industry), in top provincial posts (Xinjiang and Hunan), and in running a major state-owned enterprise (the China National Packaging Corporation). This combination of diverse leadership experiences has prepared him very well for further promotion.\n\nIn recent years there has been much discussion in China about the need to have a woman serve in the nation's highest decision-making body. Tianjin Party Secretary Sun Chunlan is well positioned to take that seat as the first female member of the PSC in CCP history.\n\nDirector of the CCP Propaganda Department Liu Qibao, director of the CCP Organization Department Zhao Leji, and director of the CCP General Office Li Zhanshu, each of whom heads a very important party organization, are also well-positioned in the Chinese political system. Their performance and personal ties with Xi or Li will be crucial in their possible ascent to the PSC.\n(text continues on page 15)",

        "text": "(continued from page 13)\nWang Huning is remarkable in that he previously served as a top aide to both Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Under Xi's leadership, he continues to play an important role in domestic and foreign policy, which enhances his chances for further promotion.Shanghai Party Secretary Han Zheng has been a popular and effective leader in Shanghai for many years. Several times over the past two or three decades, the post of party chief in Shanghai has been a stepping stone for a seat in the PSC (as in the cases of Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zeng Qinghong, Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, Xi Jinping, and Yu Zhengsheng). Because Han has never had any leadership experience outside of Shanghai and Wang has never served as a provincial or municipal leader, neither is as competitive as other candidates.\n\nDue to the recent absence of military figures on the PSC, General Xu Qiliang, the only military representative who is eligible to stay on as part of the next Politburo, has the weakest chance to obtain a seat on the PSC. But the role of the military on the domestic and foreign policy fronts may increase significantly in the next few years, which would make him a credible contender for the $19^{\\text {th }}$ PSC as well.\n\nAssuming the $19^{\\text {th }}$ Politburo will remain the same size as the three previous Politburos, 11 new members will be able to serve on this very important decision-making body. While the candidates for the Politburo are somewhat less obvious than those for the PSC, the pool of candidates is in fact also reasonably small. All candidates will likely have served on the $18^{\\text {th }}$ Central Committee as full or alternate members. Those who have had leadership experience as provincial party secretary in major provinces or in more than two provinces will be considered favorable candidates. Other factors that will be considered include representation on other national leadership bodies (e.g., the State Council and NPC); generational, gender, and ethnic minority status; and military leadership. Based on these criteria, table 5 (next page) presents 20 leading candidates and their biographical and factional backgrounds.\n\nSix of these candidates were born in the 1960s and thus belong to the so-called sixth generation. Four of them previously served as CEOs of major state-owned enterprises. Hebei Governor Zhang Qingwei previously served as the chairman of the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Chinese aerospace manufacturer that builds mid- to large-size passenger aircraft and aims to challenge the dominance of Boeing and Airbus in the global marketplace. From 2001 to 2007, Zhang served as the general manager of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, making him the youngest CEO of any of the country's flagship companies at the time. Fujian Governor Su Shulin previously served as the chairman of the China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), which was ranked fifth on the 2012 Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest corporations. Zhang and Sunday are both in their third terms as members or alternates of the 18th Central Committee. When they gained membership on the 356 -member Central Committee at the $16^{\\text {th }}$ Party Congress in 2002, Zhang was only 41 years old, the youngest full member in the Central Committee, and Su was one of the three youngest alternates on the committee. In fact, their tenure on the Central Committee has been even longer than some of the widely recognized sixth-generation front-runners, including Politburo members Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai. Neither, however, joined the Central Committee until 2007.",
