The largest decrease occurred in Quebec (-12,000; -9.5\\%), which accounted for more than half of the national decline.\n\nOther notable proportional decreases in regular El beneficiaries occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador (-7.1\\%; $-3,000$ ) and New Brunswick ( $-6.1 \\% ;-2,000$ ). British Columbia ( $+1.0 \\% ;+400$ ) was the only province to see an increase in regular El beneficiaries in August.\n\nOn a regional basis, the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Trois-Rivières ( $-16.0 \\%$; -400 ), Moncton ( $-14.1 \\%$; -500 ), and Montréal ( $-12.5 \\%$; $-6,000$ ), as well as areas outside large population centres in Quebec $(-8.2 \\% ;-4,000)$ and Newfoundland and Labrador ( $-7.2 \\%$; -2,000), posted the largest proportional decreases in regular El beneficiaries in August.\n4nt Statistics \\begin{tabular}{ll} \nStatistique \\\\\nCanada \\\\\nCanada\n\\end{tabular}",

        "text": "Fewer people in all age groups collected regular Employment Insurance benefits in August\n\nThe number of women receiving regular El benefits fell by $15,000(-7.0 \\%)$ in August, accounting for most of the monthly decline. The number of regular El beneficiaries fell for the seventh consecutive month among women aged 15 to 24 years ( $-12.3 \\% ;-2,000$ ) and women aged 55 years and older ( $-5.1 \\% ;-3,000$ ). A decrease was also seen among core-aged women (aged 25 to 54 years) ( $-7.1 \\% ;-9,000$ ) in August.\n\nAt the same time, there were also fewer beneficiaries among male youth ( $-4.3 \\% ;-2,000$ ) aged 15 to 24 years, men aged 55 years and older ( $-2.3 \\% ;-2,000$ ), and core-aged men ( $-1.4 \\% ;-3,000$ ) in August.\n\nRegular Employment Insurance beneficiaries fall in 8 of 10 occupational groups\n\nIn August, the number of regular El recipients fell in 8 of the 10 broad occupational groups. The largest decrease in beneficiaries occurred among those who last worked in sales and service occupations ( $-8.4 \\%$; $-7,000$ ), followed by those who last worked in business, finance and administration occupations (-8.1\\%; -4,000).\n\nNatural resources, agriculture and related production occupations and trades, transportation, and equipment operators and related occupations were the only occupational groups to see little change in regular El beneficiaries in August.\n\nIn the Spotlight: Job search methods among the unemployed\n\nLike other unemployed workers, recipients of regular Employment Insurance benefits may use a variety of methods to find work. Despite significant labour market changes in recent years, the job search methods used by Canadians were largely the same in August 2022 compared with the same month in 2019. Of the just over one million $(1,034,000)$ job seekers in August, more than three-quarters $(77.4 \\%)$ looked for work by searching job ads. Other commonly reported search methods included checking with employers directly (47.1\\%), placing or answering ads ( $43.2 \\%$ ), and checking with friends or relatives (30.5\\%) (not seasonally adjusted).",

        "text": "Note to readers\n\nEmployment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs\n\nNo methodological changes have been made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 pandemic period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month.\n\nData for the October 2020 reference period and onward comprise individuals who obtained El benefits and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit).\n\nConcepts and methodology\n\nThe analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss.\nEl statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures.\n\nEI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program, but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits.\n\nAll data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. To model the effects of the pandemic, values for all series from March 2020 to November 2021 have been treated with a combination of level shifts and outliers in determining a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data - Frequently asked questions.\n\nThe number of regular El beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision.\nThe number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular El benefits from August 14 to 20, 2022. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS.\n\nEmployment Insurance beneficiaries by industry\n\nThe industry of EI beneficiaries is determined by integrating EI data with record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the 52 weeks prior to the reference week, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed \"Not classified\" for the beneficiary.\n\nA census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 - Definitions for more information.\n\nData availability\n\nIn the data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008, for the March to September 2020 reference periods, data have been suppressed because a source data file contains records for Canada Emergency Response Benefit claimants and beneficiaries who could not be identified and excluded through processing.\n\nNext release\n\nData on El for September will be released on November 17.",
