It is not immediately clear if the issue has any impacts on production.\n\nThe refinery also reported an \"outage at its carbon monoxide boiler on the fluid coking unit\" on July 21, according to a state regulatory filing. The filing showed the outage caused excess emissions of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide and particulate matter. During an April 28 conference call, PBF management said work on the reformer and some secondary units at the refinery was completed in April. Officials previously said that the company will restart some secondary production units soon at the neighboring Paulsboro refinery, which could increase the utilization of the Delaware City refinery, because the two refineries operate as one refining system.\n\nPBF Energy - Paulsboro, NJ - PBF Energy will restart a 50,000-b/ d crude unit at the $100,000-\\mathrm{b} / \\mathrm{d}$ refinery that has been idled since 2020 by mid August, company officials said on July 28. The move comes as company officials expressed confidence about availability of feed stock for the unit.\n\nIn April, PBF management said its restarted a reformer and a distillate hydrotreater at the facility. At the time, management said the company expected its two East Coast refineries to run at an average 270,000-290,000 b/d for Q2 2022.\n\nPhillips 66 - Linden, NJ - The 272,100-b/d Bayway refinery reported an unspecified equipment malfunction, with around 450 lb. of hydrogen sulfide released for about an hour on June 7, according to a filing to the New Jersey environment regulator. A Phillips 66 spokesman did not comment on the incident. It is not immediately clear if the incident has had any impacts on production.\n\nOn May 30, the refinery reported \"more smoke output than allowed\" related to an incinerator compressor issue, according to an environmental filing. A source told OPIS a terminal at the refinery could be down due to a power outage.\n\nUnited Refining - Warren, PA - On April 22, a company representative told OPIS that the $70,000-\\mathrm{b} / \\mathrm{d}$ refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania is close to restarting following a one-month shutdown\ndue to maintenance, with product supplies expected to resume as early as next week. The refinery in northwest Pennsylvania was shut at midnight on March 12, the company said in an email. The specific nature of the refinery outage and any possible production impacts cannot be determined. On Feb. 18, the refinery experienced an equipment failure that released a \"natural petroleum vapor.\" Crews have been working throughout the weekend and the company said it expects the situation resolved by Feb. 20 evening.\n\nUS Territory / Virgin Islands\n\nLimetree Bay - St. Croix, USVI - St. Croix Energy has hired SLR International Corp. for environmental due diligence on the shuttered 210,000-b/d refinery and to assist in a restart plan, the new business entity said on Oct. 4. In view are bidding deadlines and extended closing dates determined at recent bankruptcy court hearings in Texas: they allow a stalking horse bid by Oct. 21, followed by an auction date of Oct. 29; parties have until Dec. 3 for a winning bidder to close the sale and Dec. 10 for a backup bidder to close.\n\nCurrent owners Limetree Bay filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 12 on the same day that EPA went to court seeking an order to extend a shutdown ordered on May 14 following \"multiple major mishaps.\" Limetree complied with the shutdown order and then suspended plans for restart on June 21 due to financial constraints. Operations at the oil storage terminal continue.\n\nPADD2 / Midwest\n\nBP/Cenovus - Toledo, OH - A fire that broke out on Sept. 20 evening at the $160,000-\\mathrm{b} / \\mathrm{d}$ refinery killed two workers, according to a BP spokeswoman. The fire was later extinguished and the refinery was \"safely shut down and remains offline\" as of Sept. 21, BP said. Sources said the fire affected a crude unit and a coker, and the refinery is expected to be offline for at least 10-14 days with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on site.\n\nAs previously reported, the refinery began a \"major turnaround\" in mid April and will down for a large part of the second quarter of the year, Cenovus officials said during an April 27 earnings call.\n\nBP - Whiting, IN - A company spokeswoman said on Sept. 8 the largest crude unit at BP's 440,000 b/d Whiting, Indiana, refinery returned to service around Sept. 2-4, and the facility could resume normal operations \"in the coming days,\" following Aug. 24 electrical",

Meanwhile, a source close to the refinery's operations told OPIS on Aug. 29 that progress is being made on a boiler affected by the fire and that the boiler should be up in the next day or so. In addition, repowering the affected units should take place within the next 24-48 hours, the source said. On Aug. 24, a BP spokesman said the refinery experienced an electrical fire that was later extinguished, and affected units were shut down as a precaution.\n\nCenovus - Lima, OH - A major turnaround at 185,000-b/d refinery during October 20121 was concluding in mid-November, in line with previous company comments that the plant would be impacted by the work in late Q3 and into Q4. OPIS notes that the plant last saw a planned turnaround between late September 2019 and late December of that year. The work accompanied tie-in of a crude flexibility project (which concluded in late November).\n\nCenovus - Superior, WI - The full cost of the project to rebuild the $50,000-\\mathrm{b} / \\mathrm{d}$ refinery formerly owned by Husky is now estimated at $\\$ 950$ million, with $\\$ 324$ million spent so far, with restart of the refinery expected \"around the first quarter of 2023,\" Cenovus said on Jan. 28. Nameplate capacity will be $49,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$, with the capability to process up to $34,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$ of heavy oil.\n\nFollowing acquisition (closed Jan. 1, 2021) the refinery is now owned by Cenovus. Husky, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cenovus, will market its products in the U.S. under the Husky name.\n\nBefore suspension of the project in March 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic, late 2021 had been targeted for restart. The refinery was shut after an explosion and fire involving the FCC and an asphalt tank on April 26, 2018.\n\nCVR Energy - Coffeyville, KS - The next turnaround for the $136,000-\\mathrm{b} / \\mathrm{d}$ refinery will focus on the coker and one of two crude units, the company said in a Nov. 2 conference call, for 30-40 days most likely in Fall 2023. The refinery saw plantwide maintenance between late February and late April 2020.\n\nCVR has continued engineering and scoping for a renewable diesel conversion that repurposes a hydrotreater, but is likely to wait for assurance that states other than California will adopt low carbon fuel standards before making a final investment decision, CEO Dave Lamp said in the call. CVR has spoken of optionality for the unit to switch between petroleum diesel and RD if warranted. Production of RD at Coffeyville could be as high as $9,800 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$ due to larger size of the unit and hydrogen plant.\n\nCVR Energy - Wynnewood, Ok - The company detailed on Nov. 2 previously disclosed Spring 2022 turnaround plans for the 78,000b/d refinery in a Q3 earnings conference call. Some 40 days of work\nwill take place on the FCC, one of two crude units and the alkylation unit. As previously reported, the FCC and alky unit saw several days of unplanned downtime in early May.\n\nThe planned maintenance, originally scheduled for Spring 2021, was deferred twice and will now take place alongside the ongoing conversion of the hydrocracker to renewable diesel production. Start-up of RD output ( $6,000-7,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$ ) is expected mid-April 2022, according to CEO Dave Lamp. The pre-treater unit on site now has Board approval and is expected to be completed late in Q4 2022, he added.\n\nExxonMobil - Joliet, IL - Planned multi-unit turnaround at the 275,000-b/d refinery took place in April and May, concluding in late May, market sources told OPIS, confirming reported spring dates. OPIS notes that the refinery's last major turnaround took place around spring of 2019, which included the refinery crude unit, FCC, coker and reformer.\n\nHollyFrontier - El Dorado, KS - May 5 company guidance puts Q2 2021 system throughput in a range of $400,000-420,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$, up from Q1 throughput of $348,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$.\n\nAs previously reported, Winter Storm Uri caused unit outages through February at both the $165,000-\\mathrm{b} / \\mathrm{d}$ El Dorado and $166,500-\\mathrm{b} /$ d Tulsa refineries. The El Dorado refinery conducted a multi-unit turnaround in Fall 2019.\n\nHollyFrontier - Tulsa, OK - Turnaround at the East Plant of the 166,500-b/d refinery was completed as of the company's Q1 2021 earnings call on May 5, but underwent either unplanned downtime or an extension of the planned work on the FCC between late March and April 21, according to information from state environmental regulators. The FCC began restart on April 20, the report said, experienced malfunction due to compressor malfunction and then went back into operation early on April 21.\n\nAs previously reported, planned downtime at the West Plant crude unit was extended in mid-February due to Winter Storm Uri and the smaller East Plant crude unit saw some 65 days of unplanned downtime because of the storm. Q1 system throughput was $348,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$, versus guidance of $350,000-380,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$, and the company's guidance for Q2 is 400,000 to $420,000 \\mathrm{~b} / \\mathrm{d}$.\n\nMarathon Petroleum - Catlettsburg, KY - The 306,000-b/d refinery has been undergoing planned maintenance in at least November 2021, if not also part of October, according to multiple press reports. End dates for the work on one or two of three crude units and one or both FCCs vary, with some estimating around Thanksgiving and others mid-December. The second-largest crude unit was reportedly down for less than a week in the first half of November and the largest crude unit, along with an FCC, reportedly underwent turnaround in Fall 2020.\n\nAt a Feb. 2 conference call, the company sees around half of its",

Resolution of the issue is seen by April 10 but the timeline is subject to change.\n\nThe refinery restarted in March following planned maintenance that began on Feb. 1. As previously reported, restart was about half accomplished by March 3, company executives said in a conference call. While the plant is \"highly winterized\" and disruption was minimal, Winter Storm Uri's freeze in mid-February halted the turnaround and delayed restart originally planned for end-February. According to RMR history, the reformer and one of two crude units last saw turnaround (two months) in Q4 2019. The other crude unit saw ten days of planned maintenance in November 2018.\n\nChevron - Pasadena, TX - The 115,700-b/ d refinery reported an unspecified \"equipment leak\" that started Jan. 4, resulting in emissions from a reformer, according to a TCEQ filing.
