        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe objective of structural engineers is to design such a structure that none of inadmissible states will occur during its service. Because of the uncertainties in load environments and structural strengthes, an ever-increasing effort has been made toward the application of probabilistic theory in structural design. In their pioneering work, Freudenthal, Garrelts, and Shinozuka (1)* have presented a rational approach to the structural reliability analysis which remains as the basis for all such analyses to-date. The state of the art of structural safety was recently summarized in a very comprehensive manner by Task Committee on Structural Safety of American Society of Civil Engineers (2).\n\nW1th regard to redundant system, Hanai (3) discussed a three-member redundant truss with the only consideration of the structural strength being statistical in nature. Shinozuka and Yao ( 4,5 ) developed several methods to compute the transition probability for redundant systems basing on the assumption that the external load is equally distributed among the exsiting members. Later Yao and Yeh $(6,7)$ proposed an approach to attack trusses by considering the tensile strength criterion and the *\n\nNumerals in parentheses refer to corresponding items in Appendix-- REFERENCES.",

MoteCarlo technique was employed by Hoshiya (8) to obtain an approximate solution for the probability of failure of indeterminate structural system. Some of the difficulties encountered in the above-mentioned approaches are counting all possible failure paths. The computation will become very complicated if the number of degrees of redundancy increases.\n\nThe aim of this investigation is to systemize the computation methods of the probability of total or partial failure for parallel redundant systems. Furthermore, the effects of the direction of load, degree of redundancy, and system geometry on the reliability of parachute-like systems are discussed as well.",

Let $W$ be the random variable of the applied load. The density function of $W$ will be indicated by $f_{W}(x)$. Then the survival probability of $k$ members among $m$ initially existing members due to the statistical load $W$ can be expressed as follows:\n$$p_{m k}=\\int_{X} p_{m k}^{\\prime}(x) f_{W}(x) d x$$\nwhere $p_{m k}^{\\prime}(x)$ is the probability of survival of $k$ members among m initially existing members due to a deterministic load w. $p_{m k}^{\\prime}(x)$ can be computed from the following expression.\n$$p_{m k}^{q}(x)=T_{m k}\\left[1-F_{R}(x / k)\\right]^{k}$$\nwhere $T_{m k}$ is the probability of failure of ( $m-k$ ) members among $m$ initially existing members due to a deterministic load w. The theorem of recurrence is used to compute $T_{m k}$ as follows:\n$$T_{m k}=T(m+1, m, m-1) T_{(m-1) k}+T_{(m-1) k}^{\\prime}$$\nwhere\n$$T(m-i, m-i-j, m-i-j-k)\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n=\\binom{m}{k}\\left[F_{R}(x / m)\\right]^{k} \\quad \\text { if } i=j \\\\\n=\\binom{m-i-j}{K}\\left[F_{R}\\left(\\frac{x}{m-i-j}\\right)-F_{R}\\left(\\frac{x}{m-i}\\right)\\right]^{k}, otherwise\n\\end{array}\\right.$$",

It is to be noted that $T_{(m-1) k}=0$ if $k=m-1$ and $T(i, j, k)$ will be considered as $T(m, j, k)$ if 1 is larger than $m$. $T_{m k}$ is the sum of function $T(i, j, k)$ and/or the product of functions $T(1, j, k)$. If $T_{m k}$ only includes one $T$ function, $T_{m k}^{\\prime}$ can be obtained by adding one to the first two arguments of $T$ function. In case $T_{m k}$ has the product of $T$ functions, $T_{m k}^{\\prime}$ can also be derived from adding one to the first two arguments of $T$ function which has the highest value of $i$ in the sequence and adding one only to the first argument of $T$ function which has the second highest value of $i$ in the same sequence.
