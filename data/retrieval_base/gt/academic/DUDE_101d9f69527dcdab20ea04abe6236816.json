Wyckoff\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report is a final report issued at the termination of an Air Force Office of Scientific Research Project entitled \"Attenuation Coefficients of High Energy X-rays\". The project is continuing under the direct support of the National Bureau of Standards as project number 0466.\n\nThe objective of the program initiated with Air Force support was the direct measurement of the total attenuation coefficients for X-rays in the energy range from 5 to 180 Mev . The research to date has resulted in detailed attenuation coefficients in hydrogen, carbon, water and aluminum, which demonstrate specific areas requiring further theoretical and experimental investigations. For example, the NBS experiments have shown that the attenuation coefficients listed in the standard reference, NBS Circular 583 entitled 'X-ray Attenuation Coefficients from 10 kev to 100 Mev \", $1 / \\underline{a} /$ are incorrect by about $4 \\%$ at 60 Mev for low atomic number materials. The source of the discrepancy is not understood, although the pair production cross section is suspect. A complete understanding will result from further experimental and theoretical estimates of phenomena such as the radiative corrections to the Compton and pair cross sections, and the limited accuracy of pair production predictions.\n\nDuring the course of the present experiments $2 / 3 /$ it was necessary to investigate such related areas as high-energy X-ray spectra $4 /$, 5 / $6 /$, $\\boldsymbol{7} /$, development and operation of large scintillation spectrometers $8 / 2 / 9,10 / 11 / 12 /$.\n\nThe references identified by superscripts in the introduction and background sections are listed at the end of the background section.",

The X -rays were transmitted through long attenuators to measure the attenuation coefficients versus X-ray energy. The X-ray detector was a large scintillation spectromece co√±oisting of a sodium-iodide crystal arrangement whose dimensions were $5^{\\prime \\prime}$ diameter by 9 \" long- ${ }^{\\prime}$. The spectrometer was developed on this project and is described in detail in attachment $B$.\n\nAlthough the detailed results of the project are given in attachment $C$, it was not possible in that description to emphasize the various experimental and theoretical conditions that were important to the attenuation experiment. The following is an enumeration and an amplification of those conditions.\n\nThe important requirements were:\n1. A high energy $X$-ray source that was continuously distributed in energy with $X$-rays in the energy range from 10 to 90 Mev . This energy range permitted an accurate evaluation of the total attenuation coefficient from 30 to 80 Mev where the electronic processes predominate. The range also permitted a determination of the coefficients from 15 to 30 Mev where the nuclear absorptions are also important for low atomic number materials. The shape of the distribution of X-ray intensity (photon number times photon energy) was derived by Hisdall/ for the case of a small-solid-angle detector",

KOCH**  \nRadiation Physics Laboratory, National Bureau of Standards,* Washington, D. C.  \n(Received October 7, 1953)\n\nX-ray spectrometers are described that operate on the principle of totally absorbing the energy of an individual x-ray photon in a scintillator. Experiments with scintillators of xylene containing terphenyl, and of sodium iodide activated by thallium, show that detection efficiencies better than 80 percent and energy resolutions better than 10 percent are attainable in the x-ray energy range from $\\frac{1}{2}$ to 50 Mev. Monte Carlo calculations and crude scaling laws that simplify extrapolations to other size scintillators are discussed.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nTHE determination of the energy of an individual x-ray photon is usually accomplished by the analysis of a single interaction of the photon with matter. The interaction processes that have permitted accuracies of better than 5 percent in the energy measurement are coherent scattering, photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production.1 Although good energy resolution2 is obtainable by these techniques, their main disadvantage is low detection efficiencies, which are characteristically of the order of $10^{-8}$ percent.\n\nThe combination of a detection efficiency close to 100 percent and a good energy resolution is attainable by the application of scintillation spectrometers in which x-ray photons interact multiple times and are totally absorbed. The total absorption of an x-ray photon in a large volume of scintillation material will produce a light pulse amplitude that is proportional to the x-ray energy. Preliminary results3 have been reported on a spectrometer that employed a tank of xylene liquid and terphenyl plus photomultiplier light detectors. The following report will describe the details of the xylene spectrometer and two sodium iodide spectrometers that are intended for research with pulsed4 accelerators in the x-ray energy range from $\\frac{1}{2}$ to 50 Mev.\n\nSeveral physicists at other laboratories have made independent suggestions, experiments, and calculations on the general principle of \"total absorption\" spectrometers.\n\n* Supported in part by the U. S. Office of Scientific Research of the Air Research and Development Command.\n\n1 J. W. M. DuMond, Rev. Sci. Instr. 18, 626 (1947); Motz, Miller, Wyckoff, Kim, and Gibson, Rev. Sci. Instr.

Rev. 74, 315 (1948).\n\n2 Energy resolution of the pulse-height distribution produced by monoenergetic x-rays will be defined as the width at half of the maximum intensity divided by the pulse height at this maximum. The width defined here is the total width of the distribution and includes the width of the photoelectric peak which forms the basis of a more common and less stringent definition of resolution.\n\n3 M. Cleland and H. W. Koch, Phys. Rev. 86, 588A (1952).\n\n4 The word \"pulsed\" refers to the short burst of x-rays that is repeated at the repetition rate or operating frequency of the accelerator.\n\nR. Sternheimer6 has made shower calculations in order to estimate the energy resolution obtainable with a 4 in. diameter and 10 in. long sodium iodide crystal spectrometer that was proposed for the measurement of the energy of 2-Bev x-ray photons. He also investigated a combination of lead glass and organic liquid scintillator for the same measurement.\n\nThe recent work of Kantz and Hofstadter5 has permitted useful predictions on the performance of sodium-iodide, total-absorption spectrometers for 100 to 160 Mev electrons and x-rays. In their experiments they measured the distribution of energy loss in copper produced by 110 and 157 Mev electron beams.\n\nThe results in references 3, 5, and 6 show that total absorption spectrometers can provide good energy resolution with high detection efficiencies for x-rays. A third desirable and concomitant characteristic of this type of spectrometer is the possibility of supplying the x-ray energy information from a single voltage pulse instead of the requirement of a coincident counting of two particles as in a pair spectrometer.\n\nThe importance of high detection efficiencies and the disadvantage of two-particle coincident counting in work with pulsed accelerators were demonstrated by J. L. Lawson.7 He analyzed the length of experimental time required to measure a spectrum of betatron x-rays with a pair spectrometer. Low x-ray intensities were required with the betatron in order to minimize the possible confusion of the positron from one pair with the electron from another. As a result, the experimental time for many low-energy, pulsed-accelerator experiments using a pair spectrometer is of the order of weeks7 or longer, and is intolerably long.\n\nIn contrast, the time for similar experiments with a total absorption spectrometer is of the order of hours.8 Therefore, many experiments with pulsed accelerators should become feasible by the proper application of these spectrometers.\n\n5 R.

The $x y$ lene container is $7 \\frac{1}{8} \\mathrm{in}$. inside diameter by 48 in . long.\n\n\nThe discussion of spectrometers that follows deals with the Monte Carlo calculations, the construction details, and the experimental applications for the three models that have been built at the National Bureau of Standards. The general characteristics of these devices are:\n1. Scintillator: Xylene liquid with $2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{liter}$ of terphenyl. Size: $7 \\frac{1}{8}$ in. diameter by 48 in . long.

The scintillator consisted of a $7 \\frac{1}{8} \\mathrm{in}$. diameter by 48 in . long tank of xylene liquid in which was dissolved terphenyl crystal to a concentration of 2 grams per liter. Single x-ray photons, whose energies were to be measured by the spectrometer, were directed down the central axis of the effective scintillator volume. The light resulting from the absorption of radiation energy in the liquid was detected by sixteen RCA 5819 photomultipliers. A schematic picture of the spectrometer is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nThe photomultiplier output pulses can supply the data from which the energy can be obtained with good\nenergy resolution, for the individual $x$-rays producing those pulses, if three conditions are satisfied.\n\nFirst, most of the cascading interactions by which the original $x$-ray photon dissipates its energy must be confined to the spectrometer scintillator.\n\nSecond, the light resulting from energy loss in the scintillator must be collected uniformly.\n\nThird, the number of light photons detected by the photomultiplier tubes for each absorbed x-ray must be large enough to minimize the effect of statistical fluctuations. This is particularly a problem for the xylerie (terphenyl) scintillator because of its large size and poor geometry, and because the number of photons liberated for a given electron energy loss is small. ${ }^{9}$\n\nMost of the time during the development of the spectrometer of Fig. 1 was spent in insuring uniform and efficient light collection to satisfy conditions 2 and 3. However, because of the recent availability of selfabsorption data ${ }^{10}$ for light in scintillators and of largearea photomultipliers, the present xylene-spectrometer design can be considerably improved and will not be described in detail. Therefore, only the results of calculations will be given, since they should prove to be a useful guide to satisfying condition 1 in any future design of a spectrometer employing an organic scintillator.\n\n\n- Experimental Nuclear Physics (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1952), Vol. 1, p. 52; and J.

        "text": "MONTE CARLO CALCULATIONS FOR XYLENE\n\nThe Monte Carlo sampling technique ${ }^{11}$ was used to provide quantitative evaluation of the performance of a specific scintillator in a total absorption spectrometer. The calculations for xylene were done for the five x -ray photon energies of $1,5,15,25$ and 35 Mev , and for a tank that was 6.5 in . in diameter and 48 in . long. A larger diameter of $7 \\frac{1}{8} \\mathrm{in}$. was used in practice. For each Monte Carlo history an individual x-ray photon was followed in to the xylene until the x-ray energy was degraded to a value that was 0.2 percent of the initial energy. The energy that was retained in the xylene was divided by the primary x-ray energy to obtain a fractional pulse height. The calculations were performed for 78 cases of $1-\\mathrm{Mev}$ primary photons, 71 cases of $5 \\mathrm{Mev}, 128$ cases of $15 \\mathrm{Mev}, 201$ cases of 25 Mev , and 267 cases of 35 Mev .\nThe distributions of fractional pulse heights are plotted in Fig. 2. The ordinate scale is the frequency of events on a logarithmic scale. The pulse height distribution for 1 Mev x-rays shows an extremely poor energy resolution, since almost all pulse heights up to the maximum are equally probable. At 5 Mev , the energy resolution is about 10 percent and is improving with energy. At energies of 15,25 , and 35 Mev the energy resolution is better than 7 percent.\nThese energy resolutions would have been those found in practice if the energy resolution had been determined solely by the electronic energy retained in the scintillator. However, experiments with betatron x-ray\n\n\nFig. 2. Monte Carlo predictions for a xylene (terphenyl) spectrometer.

Other advantages will become obvious from the discussion on the x-ray measurements at energies from 87 kev to 17.6 Mev . In this range, the xylene spectrometer, as it was built, would have been completely unsuitable because the energy resolution was poor and the cosmicray background was large.\nRough scaling laws were applied in order to determine the size requirements of the sodium iodide from the experiences with the xylene. On this basis the two sizes, 2 in . by 2 in . by 10 in . and 3 in . by 3 in . by 10 in ., of sodium iodide were selected for the Monte Carlo calculations. The x-ray photons were directed along the long dimension, and were centered on the square cross section.\n(a) Theory\n\n(1) Monte Carlo Calculations\n\nThe detail with which Monte Carlo calculations $\\dagger$ had to be performed for sodium iodide was greater than that for xylene. This arises from the high atomic number of sodium iodide which makes necessary the additional detailed examination of the photoelectric, pair production, bremsstrahlung, and annihilation processes. The calculations were performed for 166 cases of primary photons of $4.45 \\mathrm{Mev}, 66$ cases of 16 Mev and 18 cases of 40 Mev .\n\nThe most significant results of the calculations were the predictions of the pulse height distributions to be expected from a $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $10-\\mathrm{in}$. and a $3-\\mathrm{in}$. by 3 -in. by 10 -in. sodium iodide, total-absorption spectrometer. These results are shown in Fig. 3. Each curve has been averaged from histograms that were based admittedly on poor statistics. Therefore, not too much significance should be placed on the detailed shape of each curve. However, the trends among the three $x$-ray energies, and from the smaller crystal to the larger crystal, are thought to be significant. Note that the $4.5-\\mathrm{Mev}$ pulse height distribution shows evidence of subpeaks due to the escape of one and two annihilation quanta. Note also that the energy resolution obtainable with the $3-\\mathrm{in}$. by $3-\\mathrm{in}$. by $10-\\mathrm{in}$. spectrometer is almost energy independent and is approximately 10 percent.\n\n\n$\\dagger$ Nole added in proof.-A recent paper by J.

        "text": "(2) Extrapolation to Other Sizes\n\nPredictions and experiments with a small-sized crystal in a total absorption spectrometer can be used as the basis for understanding the results obtainable with larger-sized crystals. Since Monte Carlo calculations for a variety of crystal sizes are tedious, and since large crystals are expensive, the description of the crude extrapolation procedure used by the authors is given here. This method was intended only for x-ray photons with energies greater than 10 Mev .\n\nThe main features of the pulse height distribution produced by monoenergetic x-rays are the percentage energy resolution and the relative pulse height position of the most probable pulse height. If the most probable pulse height Á≠âs located at the fractional pulse height of 1 and if the energy resolution is 0 percent, then all of the pulses will be located at one pulse height and the spectrometer is said to operate perfectly. As the most probable pulse height decreases from 1, the percent energy resolution increases approximately in proportion to the decrease in the most probable height. This proportion results from the nature of the cascade process by which an x-ray loses energy. Therefore, in the following it is assumed that the most probable pulse height is displaced from 1 by an amount determined by the average loss, $\\Delta E_{r}$, of the initial photon energy, $E_{0}$, from the crystal. Likewise, it is assumed that the energy resolution is given by\n$$\\frac{2 \\Delta E_{T}}{\\left(E_{0}-\\Delta E_{T}\\right)}$$\n\nThe question of extrapolating between different sized crystals resolves itself into a prediction of the average energy loss of photons from the various crystals.\n\nTo the assumptions on the pulse height distributions was added the assumption that the average energy losses produced by finite radii $(\\Delta E)_{r}$ and l√©ngths $(\\Delta E)_{l}$ are independent. Therefore, the combined average energy loss will be\n$$(\\Delta E) r^{2}=\\left[(\\Delta E)_{I}\\right]^{2}+\\left[(\\Delta E)_{r}\\right]^{2}$$\n(a) Effect of radius.-The Monte Carlo calculations tor the $3-\\mathrm{in}$. by $3-\\mathrm{in}$. by $10-\\mathrm{in}$. sodium iodide crystal showed that an energy resolution of 10 percent or a $(\\Delta E)_{r}$ of $0.05 E_{0}$ is obtainable. This imperfect resolution can be assumed to be due entirely to the small size of the crystal in the lateral dimension. The radiation that propagates sideways is composed of annihilation radiation, low energy Compton scattered secondaries, and low energy bremsstrahlung. This energy will be attenuated with an absorption coefficient of approximately 1 Mev radiation, which is $0.544 \\mathrm{in} .^{-1}$. Therefore, the average energy loss produced by a finite radius, $r$, can be derived by setting the integral of the exponential, constant $x e^{-0.544 r}$, from 1.8 to infinity, equal to $0.05 E_{0}$. Thus it can\n\n\nFig. 3. Monte Carlo predictions for a $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $10-\\mathrm{in}$, and a $3-\\mathrm{in}$. by 3 -in. by $10-\\mathrm{in}$., $\\mathrm{NaI}(\\mathrm{Tl})$ spectrometer.\nbe shown that\n$$(\\Delta E)_{\\mathrm{r}}=0.136 E_{0} e^{-0.544 \\mathrm{r}},$$\nwhere $r$ is greater than 1.8 in .\nThe results of this calculation are given in Table I. It will be noted from the values of (\\% energy resolution) $)_{r}$ that a crystal with a 5 in . diameter cross section will provide an energy resolution that is approximately a factor of 2 better than that obtainable with a $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $10-\\mathrm{in}$. crystal.\n(b) Effect of length.-The absorption coefficient of the x -ray energy that determines the shape of the energy absorption versus depth curve in the material governs the length of the spectrometer. Kantz and Hofstadter ${ }^{6}$ have shown experimentally that the slope of the semilog plot of energy versus depth in copper is somewhat smaller than that obtained from the absorption coeffcient, $\\mu_{m}$, of the most penetrating photons. ${ }^{12}$\n\nThe minimum absorption coefficient, $\\mu_{m}$, for sodium iodide is 0.32 in. ${ }^{-1}$ and occurs at 5 Mev . Therefore, in a manner similar to extrapolations described for the radial direction, the average energy loss resulting from a crystal that is $l \\mathrm{in}$. long is\n$$(\\Delta E)_{l}=2.47 R E_{0} e^{-0.322},$$\nwhere $l$ is greater than 5 in ., and $R$ is the energy resolution obtained experimentally for a 5 in . long, and infinitely wide crystal. An approximation to $R$ can be found from the measurements with a $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $2-\\mathrm{in}$. by $5-\\mathrm{in}$. crystal. These results as drawn in Fig. 8 show that $R$ is approximately 15 percent. The results in\n\n\n${ ^{12}$ U. Fano, Nucleonics 11, (Sept. 1953) has shown theoretically that the energy versus depth relationship is expected to be $\\exp -\\mu m x \\cdot \\exp M \\cdot\\left[(\\mu m x)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\right] \\cdot x^{-6 / 0}$ at extremely great depths. $B$ is a constant for each material and has values around 2 to 3.\n}",
