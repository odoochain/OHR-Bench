These immunization issues were examined to effectively recommend policy, address barriers, best practices, and intervention strategies for the National Medical Association, its physician members and their communities.\nCONSENSUS PROCESS: A literature review was conducted with assistance from the Wyeth Ayerst medical library and the National Medical Association's Immunization Clearinghouse examining over 110 pieces of immunization literature from 1980 to 1999, which addressed immunization issues from an African American and/or minority perspective. A draft of the immunization paper was submitted to panel participants to review before the panel was convened, June 24-26, 1999.\nThe Consensus Panel was also asked to include additional immunization material, which was not included in the first draft, relevant to the immunization issues that were selected for inclusion in the immunization paper.\nThe panel then devised a short list of the most relevant issues affecting African Americans and recommendations were developed to address key areas, which included:\n- Immunization disparity rates;\n- Current literature on risk factors for under immunization;\n- Barriers to immunization;\n- Missed opportunities; and\n- Intervention strategies, including the establishment of institutional and physician best practices.\nSUMMARY: Racial and ethnic disparities in adult immunization may reflect a differential effect on African Americans when coupled with underlying socioeconomic or cultural differences that can create barriers to health care access and discourage immunizations as a preventive health measure. Scientifically based, culturally appropriate intervention strategies need to be implemented by physicians and institutions/organizations to increase immunization rates among African American adults.",

        "text": "Part I: Mission Statement and Purpose\n\n\nThe National Medical Association (NMA) is the oldest and largest national organization representing African American physicians and health professionals in the United States. Established in 1895, the NMA is the collective voice of more than 22,000 African American physicians and the patients they serve. Since its inception, the NMA has been committed to improving the health status and outcomes of minority and disadvantaged people. While throughout its history the National Medical Association has focused primarily on health issues related to African Americans and medically underserved populations; however, its principles, goals, initiatives and philosophy encompass all sectors of the population.\n\nToday, more than 100 after its founding, the National Medical Association is firmly established as a leader in medicine. The NMA serves as a catalyst for the elimination of disparities in health and the leading force for parity in medicine.\n\nImmunizations have been primarily viewed as preventive medicine tool for use in children, and this has lead to under utilization among African American adults. Although there is growing awareness and numerous strategies have been developed to address under-immunization in adults, there has been no concentrated effort to promote immunization as a preventive health measure among adult African Americans and other minority groups.\n\nConsequently, the NMA is\nconcerned about consistently lower levels of immunization rates of African-Americans compared to those of Whites and other minorities. Of additional concern are higher rates of certain conditions such diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which coupled with clinical treatment disparities, places African-Americans at higher risk for complications resulting from vaccine-preventable illnesses.\n\nThe NMA believes that too few African American adults are immunized. Despite increasing influenza and pneumococcal vaccination levels over the past ten years among adults aged 65 years or greater in all racial and ethnic groups, immunization levels among African American remain significantly below the Healthy People 2000 objective, which was achieved among Whites in 1997. Pneumococcal vaccination levels are especially low among older African Americans, and younger adults with medical conditions placing them at risk for complications from influenza and pneumococcal disease.\n\nFurther, little progress has been made in hepatitis $B$ vaccination of adults who are at high risk for infection; hepatitis B among African American adults is higher than among the majority population. These disparities heighten the need to address this critical health problem in the African American community.\n\nAccordingly, in 1998 President Clinton included adult immunization as one of the six key areas to address in the \"Initiative to Eliminate Racial and\n\nEthnic Disparities in Health.\" It was a step in the right direction, but much more must be done to reach the all time high immunization levels that have been achieved among children. To this end, the NMA has assessed this health disparity in order to recommend proactive steps that can be undertaken by the Association and its membership. On June 24-26, 1999 in Washington, DC, the NMA convened the Adult Immunization Consensus Panel comprised of the top experts on adult immunization in the country. During this panel, we drew on the knowledge of these experts and looked at the following areas:\n- the disparity rates for vaccination;\n- current literature on risk factors for under vaccination,\n- disease conditions and complications;\n- barriers to immunization;\n- missed opportunities for vaccination; and\n- intervention strategies, including the establishment of institutional and physician best practices.\nIn this paper, we first review information on the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases of adults, current recommendations for vaccination, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of vaccination, racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage levels, barriers to and missed opportunities for vaccination, intervention strategies, and selected demonstration projects. We conclude with NMA recommendations for increasing vaccination of African American adults.",

        "text": "Part II: Review of Adult Immunization Issues, Barriers and Opportunities\n\n\nA. Burden of Adult VaccinePreventable Diseases\n\nVaccine-preventable diseases are responsible for as many as 39,000 adult deaths each year in the U.S. $(20,000$ from complications of influenza infection, 14,000 from pneumococcal disease, and 5,000 from chronic hepatitis B infection) (CDC, unpublished data). By comparison, childhood immunization programs have drastically reduced the number of vaccine-preventable deaths among children, with fewer than 500 deaths reported each year. ${ }^{1}$ Pneumonia and influenza together are the fifth leading cause of death in those aged 65 years and older. ${ }^{2}$\n\nDuring 11 of 23 annual influenza epidemics from 1972 through 1995 in the U.S., more than 20,000 deaths, 90 percent among persons aged 65 years or more, were attributed to complications of influenza infection such as exacerbation of underlying medical conditions or secondary pneumonia due to bacterium such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). ${ }^{3}$ An estimated 110,000 hospitalizations a year are related to influenza. ${ }^{3}$\n\nIn addition to the human cost, the health care and lost productivity costs to society have been estimated at $\\$ 3$ billion to $\\$ 5$ billion for an average influenza epidemic, with direct medical costs accounting for 20 percent to 30 percent of the total cost. ${ }^{4}$ The estimated cost of pandemic influenza in the United States would be $\\$ 71$ billion to $\\$ 167$ billion. ${ }^{5}$\nS. pneumoniae causes 25-35 percent of hospitalizations for community-acquired bacterial\npneumonia, and an estimated 50,000 cases of pneumococcal bacteremia and 3,000 cases of meningitis annually in the U.S. ${ }^{6}$ Among adults with pneumococcal bacteremia, 60 percent-87 percent also develop pneumonia, and up to 40 percent die. An estimated 14,000 deaths result from severe pneumococcal disease annually. The risk for invasive pneumococcal disease is higher among African Americans compared to Whites. African American adults have a threefold to fivefold higher incidence of bacteremia than Whites, and have twice the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis. ${ }^{6}$ Possible reasons for these higher rates among African Americans include lower levels of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination, higher prevalence of certain conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, HIV infection $)^{7-9}$ that are associated with higher risk for severe pneumococcal disease, delayed access to care, or higher chance of exposure associated with environmental conditions.\n\nEstimates of influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths have thus far not been computed by racial or ethnic group. However, higher rates of influenza complications are expected among African Americans compared to Whites because of lower vaccination levels among African Americans and the higher prevalence of certain conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, HIV infection) among African Americans that are associated with higher risk for influenza complications. It is unlikely that there are racial differences in exposure,\nsusceptibility and risk of complications from influenza, controlling for medical conditions.\n\nInfluenza and pneumococcal vaccinations have become increasingly important for two reasons. First, prevalence of drug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae have become more common in the U.S., with 15 percent to 38 percent of isolates in selected sites nonsusceptible to penicillin in 1997. ${ }^{10}$ This emerging antimicrobial resistance further emphasizes the need for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease by vaccination. Secondly, it is anticipated that another influenza pandemic will eventually occur. ${ }^{11}$ The influenza pandemic of 1918 caused 20 million deaths, many of them in younger adults. During this pandemic, the disease affected one in four adults. As a currently under-immunized group, African Americans lack the infrastructure support to promote widespread immunizations in the event of a pandemic. Additionally, existing community beliefs/attitudes about immunizations might hamper the acceptance of mass immunization campaigns for adults.\n\nAfter influenza and pneumococcal infection, hepatitis $B$ is the third major vaccine-preventable disease among adults. Annually between 19881994, an estimated average of 335,000 persons, primarily young adults, were infected with hepatitis B virus. ${ }^{12}$ Currently, annual incidence of the disease may be as low as 100,000. ${ }^{12}$ For those persons affected by hepatitis B:\n* Between 8,400 and 19,000 require hospitalization,",

        "text": "- 6 percent to 10 percent become chronic carriers,\n- About 25 percent of chronic carriers develop chronic active hepatitis,\n- Each year in the U.S., about 4,000 persons die from hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, and\n- 1,000 die from hepatitis Brelated liver cancer.\nDuring 1988-1994, the estimated average annual incidence rate of hepatitis $B$ infections among African Americans was four times higher than the rate for Whites. ${ }^{12}$\n\nB. Immunization \\\\ Recommendations\n\nTo reduce the burden of influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis $B$ infections, specific immunization recommendations have been developed. ${ }^{3,6,13,14}$ For example, annual influenza vaccination and one dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are recommended for persons at increased risk for complications from pneumococcal and influenza infections, including all persons aged 65 years or more and younger persons with chronic conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. The American Academy of Family Physicians also has recommended annual influenza vaccination of all persons starting at age 50. ${ }^{15}$ The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is reviewing data on the risk of influenza-related complications among persons aged 50-64 years, the prevalence of high-risk medical conditions among persons in this age group, and the cost-effectiveness of this recommendation. ${ }^{3}$ The ACIP also recommends scheduling a prevention visit for every patient at the age of 50 years to assess vaccination status and take other preventive measures. ${ }^{16}$ Hepati-\ntis B vaccination is recommended for adults at high risk for exposure through sexual contact, injection drug use, or occupations involving possible contact with human blood. ${ }^{13}$\n\nAdditional disease burdens of importance for persons who were not infected or immunized during childhood may be at increased risk for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella and their complications as adults. Other adults enter special high-risk groups as a result of disease, occupation, behavior, or increasing age; all require immunizations or booster doses not routinely provided in childhood. ${ }^{17}$ For example, a booster vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria is recommended every ten years for all adults. Supplementary adult immunization recommendations are summarized in Figure 1.\n\nC. Vaccine Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness\n\nINFLUENZA VACCINE\n\nThe Influenza vaccine has reduced death, hospitalization, and clinical illness in years when vaccine and epidemic strains are similar. ${ }^{3}$ Influenza vaccine is up to 90 percent effective in preventing illness in young, healthy adults. ${ }^{3}$ Among institutionalized, high-risk older persons, those vaccinated experience a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in incidence of illness; a 50 percent- 60 percent reduction in hospitalization; and up to 80 percent reduction in death. ${ }^{3,18}$\n\nThe Office of Technology Assessment concluded that vaccination of persons aged 65 years or older would save money and improve health. ${ }^{19}$ Optimizing vaccination programs in nursing homes could prevent about 70,000 cases of\ninfluenza in a typical epidemic, saving more than $\\$ 50$ million in direct costs. ${ }^{20}$ More recently, it has been estimated that vaccination of older adults saved an estimated $\\$ 30$ to $\\$ 60$ in hospitalization costs per $\\$ 1$ spent on vaccination. ${ }^{21}$\n\nPNEUMOCOCCAL\n\nPOLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE\n\nEstimated effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes in the vaccine has ranged from 56 percent to 84 percent. ${ }^{6}$ Effectiveness was demonstrated in specific patient groups at higher risk for pneumococcal disease, including persons with diabetes, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and anatomic asplenia. Data on effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease are not compelling for certain groups of immunocompromised patients, such as those with sickle cell disease or chronic renal failure. However, these studies are limited by the small numbers of unvaccinated persons with these illnesses.\n\nVaccination against pneumococcal bacteremia can improve the health of elderly persons at a reasonable cost and would save money if the vaccine were administered under a public program (saving $\\$ 8.27$ per person vaccinated). ${ }^{22}$ Vaccination of persons aged (65 years can result in reduced medical expenses; additional years of healthy life; and save society millions of dollars. Pneumococcal vaccination is likely to result in even more cost saving for African Americans because of the higher rates of pneumococcal bacteremia and lower pneumococcal vaccination levels compared to the majority population.\n\nContinued on page 9",

Barriers to Adult Immunization\n\nSeveral reasons have been given to explain under-utilization of vaccines among adults. First, some members of the public and health care providers do not perceive adult vaccine-preventable diseases as a significant public health problems. Sec-\nond, there are unnecessary fears among patients and providers concerning adverse events following vaccination. Third, unlike childhood immunization, adult immunization indications are selective, with different target groups for different vaccines. Fourth, there are no statutory requirements for adult immunization. Fifth, there are no comprehensive vaccine-delivery systems in the public and private sectors. Sixth, there are limited reimbursement levels for vaccination services and a lack of coverage for adult immunization by third party payers. Seventh, there is a failure to establish organized vaccination programs in settings (e.g. workplace) where adults congregate. Finally, there are missed opportunities to vaccinate adults during contacts with health care providers. ${ }^{1}$\n\nRacial and ethnic disparities in adult immunization may reflect a differential effect of some or all of these factors on members of racial and ethnic minority groups, caused by underlying socioeconomic or\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nPNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION COVERAGE LEVELS AMONG PERSONS AGED 65 AND OLDER, BY RACE/ETHNICITY",

        "text": "cultural differences. These differences can create barriers to health care access and discourage appropriate use of preventive health services on the part of patients (e.g., limited access to care, lack of knowledge and negative attitude toward immunization), providers (e.g., considering immunization of adults and other preventive services as low priority within their practice, differential treatment of patients), and organizations (e.g., constraints of the practice setting, lack of organized program for delivering preventive services).\n\n\\section*{PATIENT-RELATED}\n\n\\section*{BARRIERS}\n\nThere are a number of potential patient-related attitudinal barriers to adult immunization, which include:\n- A general lack of awareness that vaccines are necessary (e.g., provider has not recommended vaccination);\n- There is a feeling that there are minimal health risks from vaccine-preventable diseases;\n- Doubts about vaccine efficacy;\n- Misperceptions about vaccine side effects (e.g., believing influenza vaccination can cause influenza);\n- A dislike or fear of needles;\n- Minimal concern for preventive health measures; and\n- A distrust of health care providers, particularly among homeless, illegal aliens, or the poor coupled with health care providers of a different racial or ethnic group.\nIn addition, socioeconomic conditions such as lower levels of income and education; unemployment and living in impoverished areas can also create barriers to vaccination by limiting access to quality care. When patients lack adequate health insurance; or a usual source of care; have limited transportation, and rely on hospital emergency departments for acute medical care they tend to have lower vaccination rates. These factors accentuate attitudinal barriers to vaccination.\n\nAmong Americans aged 65 years or older, Medicare has\nreduced many barriers to vaccination. Medicare provides influenza and pneumococcal vaccination at no cost to beneficiaries enrolled in Part B coverage. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups report contact with the health care system as often as do non-Hispanic Whites, yet African Americans have lower influenza and pneumococcal vaccination levels, even among those with more frequent contact. ${ }^{31}$ In 1996, a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries was asked to provide reasons for not receiving influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. ${ }^{36}$ Although African Americans in the sample were less likely to report receipt of vaccination, the reasons they reported for lack of vaccination were similar to those reported by non-Hispanic Whites (Figures 4 and 5) . Among persons of all racial and ethnic groups combined, of those not receiving the pneumococcal vaccine, 57 percent reported not knowing they needed the vaccine, 13 percent\n\n\\section*{FIGURE 4}\n\n\\section*{Reasons for Not receiving influenza Vaccination}\n\n<chart>\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c}\n\\hline\nReason & White & African American \\\\\n\\hline\nShot not needed? & 18.0 & 22.7 \\\\\nShot causes flu & 14.5 & 13.8 \\\\\nHave side effects? & 14.4 & 11.7 \\\\\nDidn't think of/miss & 14.1 & 13.5 \\\\\nWouldn't prevent flu & 11.5 & 10.0 \\\\\nNot at risk for flu & 7.0 & 5.9 \\\\\nDoctor rec. against & 6.3 & 4.2 \\\\\nDoctor didn't recommend & 5.4 & 6.7 \\\\\nDon't like shots/needles & 5.4 & 9.3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n</chart>\n\n\nReported by Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or more Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, 1996",

Of those not receiving recent influenza vaccination, 19 percent reported not knowing they needed the vaccine, and 39 percent had misconceptions regarding vaccine safety or efficacy (thinking it could cause influenza or other side effects, or would not prevent influenza).\n\n\\section*{Provider-RElated BARRIERS}\n\nA doctor's recommendation for vaccination can have a strong influence on a patient's decision to be vaccinated, even among persons with negative attitudes toward vaccination. ${ }^{37-40}$ Recent surveys of physicians have indicated that most were aware of and agreed with vaccination recommendations, but the main reason many cited for not delivering vaccines was oversight. ${ }^{41-43}$ This indicates the need for organized programs for vaccination delivery, which would minimize missed opportunities to vaccinate when a patient vis-\nits the healthcare provider for other problems.\n\nPrimary care providers at an ambulatory care clinic serving predominantly indigent African Americans had adequate knowledge of pneumococcal vaccine overall, and over half reported that patients accepted their recommendations for vaccination most of the time. ${ }^{43}$ Other potential barriers to provider delivery of immunization services include: uncertainties about high risk groups that require immunization ${ }^{44}$; difficulty determining a patient's vaccination status ${ }^{42,44}$; low priority for immunization ${ }^{44}$; requirements for written consent; low reimbursement for delivery of vaccination services creating physician disincentive; fears of adverse events following vaccination and related liability concerns; and beliefs that patients should be educated by mass media campaigns.\n\nBecause older African Americans have frequent contact with health care providers, it is possible that disparities in vaccination levels could in part\nresult from lower quality of care. For example, in one study in New York City, physicians with a predominately African American or Hispanic population were less likely to recommend influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for patients aged 65 and older compared to physicians with a predominately White patient population (47 percent vs. 74 percent for influenza; 27 percent $v .54$ percent for pneumococcal). ${ }^{45}$ A shortage of primary care physicians resulting in higher patient loads and constraints in the practice setting, may contribute to lowered quality of care provided to African Americans living in urban or rural poverty areas. ${ }^{46}$ Results from a recent study of adults belonging to a managed care organization showed that African Americans were much less likely than Whites to say their doctors involve them in health care decisions. ${ }^{47}$ Although African Americans are much more likely to have a minority physician than Whites, the majority are treated by white physicians",

Another study showing lower rates of referral for cardiac catheterization when patients were African American provides other evidence for subtle forms of racial discrimination in the health care delivery system. ${ }^{50}$\n\nF. Missed Opportunities\n\nAdults reporting more frequent contacts with the health care system are more likely to report vaccination, reflecting increased opportunities for vaccinations to be recommended by providers or requested by patients. ${ }^{31}$ Williams et al. identified many opportunities to provide vaccines to adults that were being missed, despite availability of safe and effective vaccines. ${ }^{51}$ Health care providers often fail to take advantage of opportunities to vaccinate during office, clinic, and hospital contacts and fail to organize programs in medical settings that ensure adults are offered the vaccines they need. More than one third of persons aged 65 years or more, or younger adults at increased risk for complications from influenza or pneumococcal infection, reported five or more contacts in the past year. However, except for persons aged 65 years or more receiving influenza vaccine, the majority had not been vaccinated against influenza or pneumococcal disease. ${ }^{31}$ Also, influenza vaccination levels are higher than levels of pneumococcal vaccination. These data indicate missed opportunities by providers to offer vaccination services.\n\nBecause previous hospitalization is a risk factor for subsequent serious pneumococcal infection, administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to inpatients has been recommended. ${ }^{3,6}$ However, among\n\nMedicare patients hospitalized for pneumonia in 12 western states in 1994, opportunities to provide pneumococcal and influenza vaccines were missed for up to 80 percent and 65 percent, respectively, of eligible persons. ${ }^{52}$ Among a group of primarily indigent African American adults treated for invasive pneumococcal disease at a teaching hospital, up to one third of the cases could have been prevented if the pneumococcal vaccine had been administered during previous encounters with the hospital. ${ }^{53}$\n\nData show that opportunities to vaccinate are missed despite older African Americans having multiple doctor visits during the year. Target vaccination groups are shown to have visited the doctor five or more times during the year without receiving influenza or pneumococcal vaccines. African Americans when compared to their White counterparts were under immunized given both groups had the identical following indicators:\n- seeing a physician a similar number of times during the year;\n- the same educational level;\n- had medical insurance; and\n- had a medical home.\n\nMissed opportunities also have been identified for administration of other vaccines, such as hepatitis $B$, measles, rubella, and tetanus toxoid. ${ }^{51}$\n\nG. Intervention Strategies\n\nThis pattern of missed opportunities has contributed to continued under-utilization of vaccinations among adults despite initiatives to improve vaccination levels. In 1990, the National Coalition for Adult Immunization issued the Stan-\ndards for Adult Immunization (Figure 6), endorsed by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, the CDC, the NMA, and other agencies. ${ }^{54}$ Beginning in 1994, national and state-based campaigns were initiated by the Health Care Financing Administration to increase influenza and pneumococcal coverage among Medicare beneficiaries. ${ }^{55}$ In 1994, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee recommended the following to improve adult immunization: 1) improve public and provider education; 2) institute major changes in clinical practice; 3) increase financial support by public and private insurers; 4) improve surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccine production and delivery; and 5) provide support for research on vaccinepreventable diseases, new and improved vaccines, immunization practices, and international programs for adult immunization. ${ }^{1}$ The Department of Health and Human Services subsequently issued an Adult Immunization Action Plan outlining a proposal for collaboration among federal agencies, state and local agencies, health professional organizations, purchasers and providers of health-care, vaccine companies, and the public, to increase adult vaccination levels. ${ }^{56}$\n\nIn 1997, utilization of vaccines among adults had improved but remained suboptimal, and racial and ethnic disparities persisted. To further improve vaccination levels and eliminate disparities, scientifically based and culturally appropriate intervention strategies are needed.

Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of these interventions.\n\nPlanning for implementation of these Task Force recommendations in a specific com-munity must take into account: observed problems; community preferences; community priorities; feasibility; activities currently being performed; current levels of vaccination coverage; causes of under immunization; and information regarding vac-cine-preventable disease rates. ${ }^{57}$ These strongly recommended interventions are primarily pro-vider-based. However, increasing community demand for vaccination may be a useful additional strategy. This is particularly true, if lack of knowledge among clients regarding the need for vaccination contributes to low coverage, and if increased knowledge will lead clients to demand vaccination from their providers who otherwise might not offer it. Enhancing access to vaccination services may also be useful to facilitate optimal timing of influenza vaccination, or for segments of the population with limited access to the health care system. This can be accomplished by offering vaccinations in non-traditional settings such as emergency departments, community centers, shopping malls, supermarkets, pharmacies and churches.
