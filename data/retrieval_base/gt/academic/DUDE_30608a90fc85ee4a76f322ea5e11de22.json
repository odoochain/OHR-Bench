ALI NADEEM REZAVI (AM 14322)\n\nTChe abandoned medieval site of Kuldhara $\\left(26^{\\circ} 52^{\\prime}\\right.$ North Latitude and $70^{\\circ} 47^{\\prime}$ East Latitude) is located in District Jaisalmer, Rajasthan (see Map I), 5 kilometers off Jaisalmer-Sam Road. Jaisalmer is situated about 18 kms to its north-east.\n\nThe author with the late Mr. Rajiv Sharma undertook an exploration of the site in September 1993, followed by a survey conducted during March 1995, a brief report of which was presented at the ASHA session at Kurukshetra in 1995 , ${ }^{2}$ entitled \"Surveying a 17 th-18th Century Settlement in the Rajasthan Desert-Kuldhara, District Jaisalmer.\" Later, in November 1995, another field-trip was made to the site in order to study a number of minor inscriptions which abound in the area. ${ }^{3}$ The present paper is based on these surveys and findings.\n\nAligned in a north-south direction $(842 \\mathrm{~m}$. long and 261 m . wide), the site of Kuldhara (KLD) is longitudinally divided by five roads (R), three of which (i.e. RI, RII and RIII) are comparatively wide and run the entire length of the township (see Plan I and II). Horizontally KLD is cut through narrow lanes (L) which connect one road with another (see Plan III). On RII, RIII, RIV, open spaces or chauk are also encountered. ${ }^{4}$ The whole township revolves around an almost centrally located temple which appears to be dedicated to Mother Goddess (see Plan IV). The township has a total of around 410 structures, residential and administrative, which line both the right (A) and left (B) sides of the roads (see Plan II). The remains of a city wall are only encountered towards the north and the south. Towards the west, the back-walls of the structures and the riverbed appears to have taken care of the defence. The eastern side of the township facing the dry-river bed of Kakni, appears to be open.\n\nLakshmi Chand, the author of Tawarikh-i Jaisalmer, informs us that Kuldhara village was first settled by a Paliwal whose name was Kadhan. ${ }^{5}$ A tank (talao) named Udhansar at Kuldhara was also dug by him. ${ }^{6}$ According to the same author, the Paliwal Brahmans were",

From there they migrated to the Pali area in Marwar. ${ }^{7}$\n\nAccording to Crooke, it was around A.D. 1156 when Sihaji, \"the founder of the Rathaur dynasty and son of the King of Kanauj\" caused the flight of the Paliwal Brahmins from Pali. ${ }^{8}$ Tod, on the other hand, believed that the cause of their migration from Pali was a Muslim invasion of Marwar due to which a war-contribution was imposed on them by the local ruler. When they refused to pay, they were punished and ultimately banished from their home territory. ${ }^{9}$\n\nA bardic poem, Pallivala-Chhand possibly of the 16 th or 17 th century mentions that in Vikram Samvat 1330 (AD 1273), a fearful battle was fought between Siha Rathod and 'Nasuradin' (possibly Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah I of Delhi), at Pali, and the Paliwal Brahmins \"after quitting Pali moved towards the west.\" ${ }^{10}$\n\nThe Paliwal Brahmins after leaving their native-place apear to have slowly moved and settled in the regions of Jaisalmer, Marwar, Bikaner, Dhat, Barmer and Sindh. ${ }^{11}$ A large number of them also settled in the Pokaran area. ${ }^{12}$ It however seems that the largest number of these Paliwala settled in Jaisalmer territory. A total number of 84 villages, locally known as Khera were settled by them, which, says Lakshmi Chand, had a total of \" 20,000 houses\". ${ }^{13}$ These settlements stretched \" 40 kos to the East, 25 kos to the South, 25 kos to the West and 30 kos to the North of the city (Jaisalmer). ${ }^{14}$ The most important of these Paliwal settlements in Jaisalmer appear to be Kuldhara, Jajiya, Khaba, in the south-east and Kathodi ${ }^{15}$ on the north of Jaisalmer town. While tabulating the villages of the 17 parganas of Jaisalmer in 1890, Lakshmi Chand lists only 64 (out of the alleged 84) Paliwal villages. of which 21 (including Kuldhara) were in Pargana Jaisalmer, ${ }^{16} 9$ in Pargana Kot Fatehgarh, ${ }^{17} 7$ in Pargana Khaba, ${ }^{18} 21$ in Pargana Devi, ${ }^{19}-4$ in Pargana Nokh, ${ }^{20}$ and one each in Pargana Khuiyala ${ }^{21}$ and Lakha. ${ }^{22}$\n\nThe Paliwals' first extant monument, a temple, dating back to a period not later than A.D. 15th century, is located at a place known as Mandal or Mandhai near the Jaisalmer-Barmer border\n\nWhatever their date of migration from Pali, from two (see Appendix A) devali (cenotaph) inscriptions it appears that at least by early 13th century the Paliwals started settling at Kuldhara. The first inscription records the death of a Branman (\"Vrahman\") in Bhattik Samvat 612 (i.e. A.D. 1235) (see plate (e). Another cenotaph-inscrip-",

However, what ap. pears clearly from these inscriptions is that the settlers at Kuldhara from its establishment, down to its desolation in the 19th century were invariably Brahmins (Vrahmans, Vaman). In a number of inscriptions (see Appendix A) the term which appears is \"Kuldhar\" or \"Kaldhar\". This term is sometimes preceded by the term \"jati\". ${ }^{26}$ In one inscripton the caste described is \"Vrahman Kuldhar jati Mudgal ${ }^{\\circ}$ (i.e. Kuldhar Brahman, sub-caste Mudgal). ${ }^{27}$ In yet another, the description is \"Vrahman Govindni jati Kuldhar Lohar'thi. ${ }^{28}$ (Brahman Govindni, the sub-caste of whom is Kuldhar Loharthi).\n\nFrom this it would appear that \"Kuldhar\" was the name of a sub-caste of the Paliwal Brahmins, who being the chief settlers gave their caste name to the setlement itself. ${ }^{29}$ The other sub-castes (jati) of the Paliwal settlers at Kuldhara, as mentioned in the cenotaphinscriptions, ${ }^{30}$ are :\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n1.

Sutdhana } & \\text { 3. Gargvi } & \\text { 4. Gago }\\end{array}$\nOne inscription also mentions the kul viz. Gonali of a Brahmin settler. ${ }^{32}$ Among the non-brahmins we find mention of two Sutradhars (architects) viz. Dhanmag ${ }^{33}$ and Sujo Gopalna. ${ }^{34}$\n\nFrom these inscriptions it also appears that these Kuldhar Brahmins invariably married women of their own caste. ${ }^{35}$ However the jati of the husband and wife would mostly differ. Thus a Brahmin whose jati was Kuldhar married a woman whose jati was Harjalu. ${ }^{36}$ Another Brahmin who was of Mudgal jati and Sutdhana gotr married a woman who was a Brahmin of Lahthi jati. ${ }^{37}$\n\nDuring the course of our survey three cremation grounds viz.

In Cl we find the centoaphplatform of a certain Brahman Narain who was a \"dehli\" or agriculturist. ${ }^{38}$ In C2 there is the cenotaph of a person designated \"Mahajal Lalan\" (Caretaker of the lake/tank). Can we thus explain Cl to have been the cremation ground of the richer traders and agriculturists and C2 to be that of the bureaucratic class? A study of the three cremation grounds does reveal some sort of socialstratification among these Kuldhara settlers. A majority of these cenotaphs are in the shape of a pillar erected from the ground. These stones are about 3 to 4 ft in height and adorned with the sculpture in relief of a male and a female deity. A few are adormed with either a male or a female deity. However in C2 one encounters a number of very tall pillars, about 10 ft high which invariably have only a male deity adorning their crown. Then we have a third category, which again is sizeable. The cenotaph stone in this case is raised on top of a square platform. The platforms are around 2.5 ft high and 5 to 8 ft in length and breadth. At C2 however one encounters quite large platforms. Yet another type of devalis are in the form of chhatris or square kiosks with a pyramidal roof on top of square platforms. One encounters five chhatris at $\\mathrm{Cl}^{2}$ and two at C2. At C3 we have only one such chhatri. The last type of a debali is in the form of a miniature temple with a pillar inscription having the idols placed inside it. The stone of the cenotaph-pillar in such a devali is of a better quality. 1 Cl we have three such devalis, whereas in C3 we have only two. One such devali at C1 and III respectively has a different kind of idol. The crown of the pillar is divided into two panels. In one panel stand two females with follded hands. while in the second panel in C3 a male stands besidies a platform on which sits a female with the prostate body of a male. In the second panel in the temple-devali in Cl a female stands besides the platform on which sits a male with a prostrate body of a male. [see plate (c)].\n\nThus one finds that at Kuldhara the devalis are of six kinds:\n(i) Cenotaph-stones\n(ii) Cenotaph-pillars\n(iii) devali in the form of ordinary platforms\n(iv) devalis in the form of large platforms\n(v) devalis in the form of chhatris",

        "text": "(vi) devalis in the form of miniature temples\n\nThese six categories were presumably representative of a similar categorization in Kuldhara society.\n\nThe composer of the Pallival-Chhand ${ }^{39}$ writes that 13 th century Pali was ruled by a Brahmin rishi Visahat. His subjects, including the warriors, were also mostly Brahmins. In Cl one of the minia-ture-temple devalis, which has two panels, occurs the name of a Kuldhar Brahmin of Mudgal jati and Asamar gotr. He died in Samvat 1777 (AD 1720). Was he, in the tradition of his ancestors in 13th century Pali, the headman of his community at Kuldhara?\n\nFurther light on social-stratification is thrown when we look at their residential structures. If one takes the material of construction into account then one can categorize the structures in three categories :\n(a) Those which are constructed with stones rubble of the locally available fine-grained buff and yellow sand-stone. Such structures abound in the whole township.\n(b) The structures are constructed with thin deep brown Jurassic stone rubble. These structures are mostly located from the extreme north to the middle of RI and the whole of RI I (see Plan II). Some structures near the temple are also of the same material.\n(c) In a very few structures, instead of using stone-rubble or the thin Jurassic-stone rubble, semi-polished yellow buff stone blocks have been utilized as a medium of construction. Such material has been used in RIA-23, RIIA-39, RIIA-40, RIIA-45, RIIA-49, RIIA-51, RIIA-52, RIIA-53. RIIB-16. RIIB-41. RIIB-44. RIIB-45, RIIB-46, RIIB-47, RIVA-1, RIVA-2, RIIIA-48, RIIB-27, RIIB-30, RIIB-31, RIIB-31, RIIIB-32, RIIIB-34 AND RIIB-35. It has also been partially utilized (only the outer walls of RIA-37, RIB-12 and RIIIB-33).\n\nWhen we look at Plan II, we realize that this third and the most superior category of residences is to be generally found towards the south of the township which was closest to the source of water, the River Kakni. Possibly these structures belonged to the influential strata of the society the administrators and the big merchants and farmers.\n\nFurther light is thrown on this issue when one looks at the plans of the various structures.\n\nGenerally, the Kuldhara residential sturctures appear to centre around the courtyard, at the extreme end of which was placed the",

Towards the right and left of the courtyard was constructed a verandah (pathiyal) raised with the help of crude stone-pillars. On both the sides (at times only on one side) of the central chamber. some small low-roofed cubicles were constructed. Such type of single courtyard and single chambered houses are the most commonly found structures at Kuldhara. They are around 64 to 80 sq m . in area. These were possibly the residences of the general masses of Kuldhara.\n\nOn RI and RII we also encounter a few very small structures (for example RIA-34) comprising of a single small chamber squeezed at the end of a very narrow courtyard. It appears as if the space between two structures was roofed and cordoned off from the road with the help of a screen wall to form a single room apartment for a person with little means. ${ }^{40}$\n\nThe section of the society which was comparatively better placed constructed houses whose main entrance. instead of opening directly into the courtyard, adjoined a small rectangular space. placed lateral to it, which acted as type of deorhi (mora in local parlance) and shielded the inner view of the house. This open space behind the main entrance usually had a small cubicle. Crude stones sometimes jutted out on one of its walls acting as stairs to reach the ceiling. Such houses are mostly located on RIB, RI and RIII. Some houses on RIA are also of this category. Adjoining these residential structues, a cow-pen is also sometimes encountered. Were these houses of the agriculturists who had amassed some wealth? Apart from the crude stairs, such houses sometimes also had windows, ventilation (e.g. see RIA-26) and large stone-shelves placed in the room and verandah walls.\n\nA more superior class constructed houses which comprised two courtyards. These structers (see for example. RIIA-7) were divided into two portions. The main doorway, which was fronted with two medium sized platforms (used possibly for recreation). opemed into a rectangular courtyard, around which were placed a number of rooms. A door from this courtyard would open into a mora (deormi) leading to the inner courtyard. As in other general houses of Kuldhara, there was only a single main chamber at the extreme emd of this courtyard, flanked with one or two cubicles on its sides. On the sides of this second courtyard fronting the main chamber were",

In most of these structures a shallow water-trough (nadi) was placed at the door of the deorhi leading into the main courtyard.\n\nSuch houses are located generally towards the north on all the three major roads (RI, RII \\& RIII). They are also to be found in the area around the centrally located temple. They are generally 25 to 27 m . long and 13 to 15 m . wide (i.e. 325 sq.m. to 405 sq.m. in area). These magnificent structures probably housed the rich strata of the Kuldhara society. But interestingly enough, the material mostly used in their construction was of the first two categories discussed above (i.e. fine-grain buff and yellow sand-stone rubble and the deep brown Jurassic-stone rubble),\n\nAround ten houses to the extreme north on RI(A), which fall in the above category have an added feature. A long, narrow and enclosed chamber constructed at the back provided with a small and low (French window type) opening. This was possibly the Kothar or Kothadi used as a storage. These were probably the dwellings of the rich traders and merchants. This view is strengthened by the fact that open spaces are provided (see Plan I $\\&$ II) in front of these structures where bullock and camel-carts could easily have been parked. During the course of our survey a few stone-hooks and rings sunk into the ground, to which the animals could be tied, were located in areas between RIB-2 and RIB -3 and the open space on RII in front of RIIA 1-4 (just adjoining the RIIB-1) and between RIIB-1 and RIIB-2. The market area (hat) with temporary shops was situated near the north-west of the RI gate (see below).\n56 Thureaucratic structures ${ }^{41}$ and the houses of the adminsitrators, who again were rich farmers and traders, built their houses with the semi-polished yellow buff-stone blocks as has been pointed out above. These structures made of superior quality building material were made on a plan similar to that of the previous category. Although they did not have the Kothar adjoining their back-wall, they had two other additional features - (a) the - pillarbrackets and leaves had floral patterns carried on them. The pillars were also sometimes provided with beautifully carved bases. (b) In some of them (if not all) we also encounter basement rooms, constructed with the same semi-polished yellow buff stone blocks.\n\nInterestingly enough, two structures at Kuldhara (RIIA-39 and",

The central room of RIIA-39 is the highest structure in the whole township. Its upper-most plinth is as high as the roof of there structures around it. Were these structures the residence of the Kuldhar Brahmin of jati Mudgal and gotr Asamar (see Inscription 13) and another Brahmin (Inscription no.50) who died in 1720 and 1724 AD respectively, and whose miniature temple devalis were built in C1 \\& C3 and adorned with a superior marble stone pillar crowned with two panels? Possibly these two structures and devalis belonged to the two principal men of Kuldhara.\n\nIf we relate the information of the devalis and the residential structures, then we find that both of them were of six categories. As in life, so in death was their status differentiated. If the members of the high class lived in magnificent double-courtyard sturctures. after their death miniature-temples and Chhatris embraced their memorial stones and ashes. ${ }^{43}$ A person passing his life in humbile dwellings would have his memorial stone set simply on the ground. His status in life would determine his status at the last resting place.\n\nIf the idols carved on the memorial stones are taken to be an indication of the social milieu, it would appear that the malies generally sported a beard and covered their heads with turbams which was of Mughal character. They wore a tunic (jama) and a waist-band (kamar band). Among the male ornaments, a recklace was quite common. He would also carry a small dagger (khanjear) tucked to his waist. He could also sport a conical cap, an angvastra, kamar band and the Brahmins' sacred thread (janeu). In this attire. the Brahmin would decorate his forehead with an elongated tillow. The women would wear either a long decorated tunic ar just a multi-pleated lahanga without a blouse and a few necklaces. Their headgear was mostly conical.\n\nBeing Vaishnavites, the inhabitants of Kuldhara frequently invoke the name of Ram and adorned the side panels of the centralized temple with the sculptures of Mahisasura Mardini and Vishman. Being basically traders, bankers and farmers they adorned their gateways with a miniature sculpture of Lord Ganesha. Most of their inscriptions would start after invoking the name of this elephant god (Sri Ganesa-i Namah). They also appear to have been worhsuppers of bull and a local god/goddess riding a horse.

He decorated his vessels with simple geometrical patterns such as check, triangles and quadrangles. These designs were executed with the help of running straight or wavy black bands on the red vessels. This survey has revealed the sherds of storage jars, basins, vases, handis with globular sides and knobbed lids.\n\nAmong the social customs, we are informed that these Paliwal Brahmins did not celebrate the festival of Raksha-bandhan. ${ }^{45}$ They are also said to have paid a bride-price to the father of the bride at the time of marriage.

This was the time when the flight of the Paliwals from Kuldhara had commenced. Ultimately, in 1890 we find that Kuldhara had further declined to 117 houses and 37 persons. ${ }^{52}$\n\nThese Paliwal Brahmins were expert agriculturists. moneylenders and merchants and in a way the major mainstay of Jaisalmer economy. 53 Munshi Hardyal Singh writing in the late 1 Sth century mentions a tradition current among the Paliwals of Marwar. According to him, they generally believed that at the time of their flight from Pali, those who left the town by the west-gate, took the profession of cultivation and those who passed through the eastern gate became bankers and merchants. ${ }^{54}$ On reaching Jaisamer they became not only equal in number to the Rajputs but far surpassed them in wealth. ${ }^{55}$ Their wealth was such, writes Lakshmi Chand, that when one of the sons of Maharajah Jaswant Singh (d.1702) was betrothed to the daughter of the Maharana of Udaipur and the Maharana passed a comment on his financial viability, the Prince wrote a hundi of Rs. 2 lakh on a kothi of a Paliwal of Kulditara. On receiving the said hundi, the Paliwal commented, \"I have a dufan in Mewar, from where you could have collected this amorat. Winat was the need for you to despatch it here for such a paltry amount? All the same, take it from my kothadi in whatever coin (sicka) you need. ${ }^{56}$\n\nA survey of the site and its geographical location both point out the feasibility of both these activities.\n\nThe site is located near River Kakni (see Map I) whith at this point bifurcates into two branches. One branch, whica now is known as Masurdi Nadi, goes towards Khaba (around 18 km . of Kuldhara) where it terminates and forms the Masurdi Ehadeen, where, when the Paliwals used to dwell \"9000 maunds of seeds (bij) could be cultivated. ${ }^{57}$ The second branch of Kakni from Auldtara",

On the eastern side of Kuldhara the survey revealed seven wells and a step-well (baoli) (see attached plates) most of which are at present non-functional and filled with sand and rubble. Two of the wells, one in the extreme north of the lower settlement and another, situated between the baoli and the main settlement [see attached plate (h)], though dry, are not filled with sand. An examintion of these two wells revealed that they were of kosita (i.e. deep) variety. Their drums are dressed with alternating layers of rectangular stone blocks which would bear the pressure of the outer soil and sand, thus preventing the inner vertical wall from collapsing. At the ground level a rectangular platform was raised.\n\nThe step-well is located around 120 meters off the main settlement. It is aligned, like the settlement, in a north-south direction. The entrance to it is in the north from where a stepped corridor leads down to two storyes, the lower one of which is now covered with sand. On both the storeys and inside the square well of the baoli are carved the images of Lord Ganesh. A pillar inscription placed near the entrance of the baoli mentins Tejpal, a Kuldhar Brahmin, who constructed this \"baoli jal ki\" (water-well) in V.S. 1815 ( 1757 AD). A raised platform nearby appears to have been once a room for the custodian or watchman of this step-well.\n\nBy 1850, it appears that although most of the wells had dried up. the baoli and the two deep-wells (bero) were still functioning. ${ }^{59}$\n\nApart from getting water directly from the river bed, the wells and the baolis for the purpose of irrigation and cultivation, the water of the river could be dammed to form a Khareen, as was done near Khaba. Khareen means an artificial depression created through human labour, dammed on three sides to collect water. This water, as it evaporates would create soil conducive for agriculture. It appears that most of the Khareens were constructed by the Paliwal Brahmins. ${ }^{60}$ As the water dries up, jowar, wheat and gram could be grown. ${ }^{61}$ A Khareen, around $2.5 \\mathrm{sq} . \\mathrm{km}$ in area is located towards the south of Kuldhara.\n\nAlthough we do not know what other crops were sown by the Kuldhar a cultivators apart from wheat and jowar in their Khareen,",

They also rear and keep flocks. ${ }^{-69}$\n, This could have easily been possible from Kuldhara as the township was on the route between Jaisalmer and Sindh. ${ }^{70}$ A survey of the township also reveals that the northern district of Kuldhara was well-equipped to handle the carts of the caravans. The kothars in the houses on RI could store the merchandise and the large khareen with its extensive field produced enough to be carted to distant places. A sizeable hat, located in the north-west corner of the town, ${ }^{71}$ catered to the needs of the local merchrants and pedlars. The survey revealed a number of platforms wwich might have been used to display goods) and a chhatri aroum an oval pond (see Map). This hat is on the route from Kuldhara to Jajiya, Dedha and Khaba (Paliwal settlements) on one side and Munpiya and Damodara on the other.

When the township was flourishing during the 17 th $\\& 18$ th centuries, there were at least five wells, two deep-wells and a massive baoli. In 1815 most of the wells had dried up. During the present century, although there are a few settlements nearby, yet the source of water is not a well but the stagnant water in some portions of the river bed. As the watertable went down and the sources of irrigation dried up, the productivity of the soil kept on diminishing. The state maintained its demand at the previous level. The Paliwal cultivators and traders would thus have had little choice but to abandon Kuldhara and migrate elsewhere.\n\nNOTES\n1. Rajiv Sharma.
