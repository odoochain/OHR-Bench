Here we show that vitamin $C$ anticancer activity is limited by the upregulation of the stress-inducible protein heme-oxygenase-1. The fasting-mimicking diet selectivity reverses vitamin C-induced up-regulation of heme-oxygenase-1 and ferritin in KRAS-mutant cancer cells, consequently increasing reactive iron, oxygen species, and cell death; an effect further potentiated by chemotherapy. In support of a potential role of ferritin in colorectal cancer progression, an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas Database indicates that KRAS mutated colorectal cancer patients with low intratumor ferritin mRNA levels display longer 3- and 5-year overall survival. Collectively, our data indicate that the combination of a fasting-mimicking diet and vitamin C represents a promising low toxicity intervention to be tested in randomized clinical trials against colorectal cancer and possibly other KRAS mutated tumors.\n\n\n${ ^{1}$ University of Milan.

        "text": "Pharmacological doses of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) have been proposed as a potential anticancer therapy according to different pre-clinical and clinical trials ${ }^{1-3}$. Recent studies indicate that KRAS-mutant cancers may exhibit higher susceptibility to vitamin C antitumor effects, thus making this generally non-toxic compound a potential weapon against this aggressive tumor type ${ }^{4,5}$. High-dose vitamin C can exert its anticancer effects by pro-oxidant reactions, which cause the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals via Fenton chemistry. In turn, these reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause damage to macromolecules, thereby leading to cell death ${ }^{3,4,6-8}$. Vitamin C's pro-oxidant action is strictly dependent on metal-ion redox chemistry. In particular, free iron was shown to be a key player in vitamin C-induced cytotoxic effects ${ }^{3,9}$.\n\nKRAS-mutant cancer cells rely on high levels of ROS and on a labile iron pool (LIP) to sustain their growth ${ }^{10-12}$. Increasing evidence supports the link between ROS production and free iron ${ }^{10,13,14}$. In particular, ROS could release iron from ironcontaining proteins, thus expanding the LIP, which in turn could enhance ROS formation through redox chemistry ${ }^{10,13,14}$. Moreover, RAS oncogenic activation further increases cellular iron content by upregulating iron-uptake proteins, such as transferrin receptor (Trf1), and by downregulating iron export and storage proteins, in particular ferritin ${ }^{10-12}$. In this context, the stress inducible protein heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), regulates ferritin expression to avoid an excessive free iron content, which can damage macromolecules ${ }^{15}$.\n\nAlthough high-dose vitamin C could potentially be effective in treating patients with KRAS mutated cancers, it is unlikely that this treatment, when used as a monotherapy, would be sufficient to target the molecular heterogeneity and multiple escape mechanisms of these tumors ${ }^{16}$. Therefore, strategies to enhance and expand vitamin C activity in the treatment of $K R A S$ mutated cancers are necessary.\n\nWe have previously shown that fasting or a fastingmimicking diet (FMD) reduce tumor progression and sensitize different types of cancer to chemotherapy, while protecting normal cells from chemo-toxic side effects ${ }^{17,18}$. These phenomena are known as \"Differential Stress Sensitization\" and \"Differential Stress Resistance\", respectively ${ }^{17-21 .}$ The differential effects of fasting on normal (protection) and cancer (sensitization) cells can be mediated, at least in part, by its effects on the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway and on glucose levels ${ }^{19-22}$. However, since fasting remains a challenging option for cancer patients, a more feasible and safer diet whose specific formulation mimics the effects of fasting was developed ${ }^{23,24}$. FMD refers to a plantbased, calorie-restricted, low sugar, low protein, and high-fat dietary composition administered cyclically and alternated with refeeding periods sufficient to prevent or minimize lean body mass loss (the caloric content of the FMD that we used for this study is indicated in the \"Methods\" session) ${ }^{24}$.\n\nTo identify a highly effective but a low toxicity treatment for KRAS-mutant cancers, here we investigate the effect of FMD in potentiating the anticancer activity of vitamin C, alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy with a focus on colorectal cancer (CRC). Our findings reveal that FMD cycles selectively potentiate vitamin C anti-cancer effect against KRAS-mutant tumors, both in vitro and in vivo, by reverting the vitamin C mediated upregulation of HO-1. We also provide data showing that the toxic action exerted by FMD and vitamin C is further potentiated by chemotherapy. Together, our data support that cycles of FMD plus pharmacological doses of vitamin $C$ could represent a promising therapeutic opportunity to be tested in the clinic for the treatment of KRAS mutated cancers.\n\nResults\n\nFMD enhances vitamin C toxicity in KRAS-mutant cancer cells. We investigated whether the fasting/FMD potentiates the anticancer effect of vitamin C against different KRAS-mutant cancer models. Human (HCT116, DLD-1) and murine (CT26) KRASmutant CRC cell lines, as well as KRAS-mutant lung cancer (H23, H727) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PANC1) cells, were grown in control medium ( $1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ glucose and $10 \\%$ serum; CTR) or in a FMD-like medium ( $0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ glucose and $1 \\%$ serum), here referred to as short-term starvation condition (STS), which mimics the reduction of extracellular glucose and growth factor concentrations that occurs during prolonged ( $>48 \\mathrm{~h}$ ) fasting or FMD in vivo, with or without pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C $(\\geq 0.3 \\mathrm{mM})$. Consistent with recent findings ${ }^{4}, K R A S-$ mutant tumor cells were more susceptible to vitamin C compared with $K R A S$-wild-type cancer cells (Fig. 1a, b). When cancer cells were grown under STS conditions before and during treatment, vitamin C-mediated toxicity was strongly enhanced (Fig. 1a). Conversely, KRAS-wild-type CRC (SW48, HT29), prostate cancer (PC-3), ovarian cancer (COV362) cell lines and a normal colon cell line (CCD841CoN) were resistant to vitamin C when used both as a single agent and in combination with STS (Fig. 1b). In agreement with the selective toxicity of STS + vitamin C in KRAS-mutant tumor cells, we found that HT29 and SW48 cells genetically modified to express the active form of KRAS were more susceptible to STS + vitamin C compared with their wildtype isogenic counterpart (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nConsistent with our in vitro results, we found that FMD cycles combined with daily vitamin $C$ treatment ( 4 g per kg twice a day) were effective in delaying the progression of KRAS mutated tumors in different mouse models (Fig. 1d-f). In particular, weekly cycles of a three days FMD were sufficient to reduce KRAS mutated tumor growth to the same extent as high-dose vitamin C (Fig. 1d, e). Notably, weekly FMD and daily vitamin C showed the best therapeutic outcome in reducing CRC progression in xenograft and syngeneic mouse models as well as in an orthotopic model (Fig. 1d-f and Supplementary Fig. 2a).\n\nFurthermore, the FMD-vitamin C combination was safe and well tolerated in both mouse strains, as indicated by mouse body weight loss, which did not exceed $20 \\%$ and was rapidly recovered upon refeeding (Supplementary Fig. 2b).\n\nROS mediate sensitization to vitamin C. We previously showed that fasting/FMD sensitizes different types of cancer cells to chemotherapy through a mechanism that involves increased ROS production ${ }^{17,25}$. ROS, including $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and superoxide, generated as by-products of normal metabolism, cause damage to DNA, lipids and proteins ${ }^{26}$.\n\nRecent studies have shown that KRAS mutations promote metabolic reprogramming to sustain high-proliferation rates, accompanied by a higher oxidative state compared with KRAS-wild-type cells ${ }^{11,12,27,28}$. Thus, we hypothesized that the higher oxidative state of KRAS-mutant tumors may underlie the selective mechanism of FMD + vitamin C toxicity. Notably, the combination of STS and vitamin C strongly induced DNA damage in CT26 and HCT116 cells, as indicated by the phosphorylation of the histone H2AX (Fig. 2a), suggesting that oxidative stress may participate in mediating this cytotoxic effect. Indeed, the combination of STS and vitamin C selectively exacerbated ROS production in KRAS-mutant tumor cells (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Consistent with the vitamin C-dependent production of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$, we observed the same selective increase in ROS in $K R A S$-mutant cancer cells grown in STS condition and treated with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (Supplementary Fig. 3b).",

Since the combination of FMD/ STS and vitamin C increased ROS levels in KRAS-mutant cancer cells, we investigated whether this correlates with an increased pool of labile ferrous iron. In HCT116 cells, ferrous ion ( $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ) levels were significantly increased upon STS and vitamin C cotreatment compared with all other conditions (Fig. 3a), suggesting a potential role of iron in mediating this effect. Ferritin, the main protein involved in iron binding and storage, regulates the intracellular LIP and its downregulation has been shown to increase LIP in KRAS-mutant cancer cells ${ }^{10-12}$. Thus, we measured the levels of the heavy subunit of ferritin (FTH), which is responsible for the iron storage through its ferroxidase activity ${ }^{10}$. Consistent with the increase in ferrous iron, we found that STS, alone or in combination with vitamin C, downregulated FTH protein expression selectively in $K R A S$-mutant cancer cells. On the other\nhand, vitamin C reversed STS-induced ferritin downregulation in KRAS-wild-type tumor cells (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 4). These in vitro results were also confirmed in vivo, where FMD cycles combined with vitamin C treatment downregulated FTH protein expression in HCT116-derived tumors (Fig. 3c).\n\nConsistent with a sensitizing effect of FTH downregulation in KRAS mutant cancer cells, our analysis of CRC patient-survival data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas Database (TCGA), showed that patients with KRAS mutated tumors and low intratumoral ferritin transcriptional level had a longer 3- and 5year overall survival when compared with patients whose tumors expressed high ferritin level (Fig. 3d). This association, which was not observed for wild type KRAS tumors, supports the role for FMD + vitamin C as a strategy to maintain low ferritin levels and increase ROS to treat KRAS mutated tumors. Notably, these data represent less than 200 patients; therefore, analyses of larger patient populations are required to better understand the role of",

        "text": "thus confirming that the increase in intracellular free iron mediated by FMD/STS and vitamin C is, at least in part, responsible for their cytotoxic effect.\n\nFMD reverses the effect of vitamin C on HO-1. Several studies suggested a potential role of ferritin in protecting cells from oxidative damage through the sequestration of intracellular free iron ${ }^{10-12}$. Among enzymes promoting ferritin expression, the stress-inducible HO-1 has been implicated in promoting cell survival during cell exposure to oxidative insults ${ }^{29,30}$. Since the FMD/STS downregulates the FTH protein expression level, we investigated whether HO-1 is implicated in FTH regulation in response to STS and vitamin C treatment. In one recent study from our group, the FMD sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy in part by downregulating HO-1, further supporting a possible role of this stress-inducible protein in mediating FMD beneficial effects ${ }^{31}$.\nTo test our hypothesis, we evaluated the association between HO-1 expression and FTH induction. To this end, we treated HCT116 cells with the HO-1-activator hemin and verified that hemin increases both HO-1 and FTH protein levels under CTR and STS growing conditions (Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, we found that treatment with vitamin C significantly upregulated HO-1, while FMD/STS reversed this effect both in vitro and in vivo in $K R A S$-mutant cancer cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). In KRAS-wild-type cancer cells HO-1 levels were not altered upon vitamin C administration under CTR condition, and the combination of vitamin C and STS did not downregulate but instead induced HO-1 protein expression level (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6b).\n\nCollectively, these findings indicate that the differential regulation of $\\mathrm{HO}-1$ and the resulting effect on ferritin/iron pathway mediate the FMD-dependent sensitization to vitamin C selectively in a KRAS-mutant background.\n\nThe ability of the FMD to prevent vitamin C-induced HO-1 upregulation in KRAS-mutant cancer cells prompted us to investigate whether HO-1 levels affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to the combination treatment. Consistent with this hypothesis, the HO-1 activator hemin protected human and murine KRAS-mutant CRC cells from vitamin C-induced cell death, alone or in combination with STS (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin ( ZnPP ) made $K R A S$-mutant CRC cells more susceptible to vitamin C in nutrient-rich condition (CTR) (Fig. 4d). Consistent with these findings, HO-1 knockdown in HCT116 cells also increased cancer cell death upon vitamin C exposure in CTR condition (Fig. 4e). Thus, overall these results support the role of HO-1 in regulating KRAS-mutant cancer cell sensitivity to vitamin C.\n\nTo characterize how FMD/STS affects HO-1 levels and modulate cancer cell sensitivity to vitamin C, we analysed the effect of glucose or serum deprivation. Interestingly we found that glucose, serum growth factors and amino acids were not responsible for the STS-dependent enhancement of vitamin C toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Addition of holo-transferrin (iron-bound form) but not apo-transferrin (iron-free form) reversed STS + vitamin C-mediated toxicity and HO-1/FTH axis downregulation (Fig. 4f; Supplementary Fig. 7b). These results are consistent with the concept that iron levels in the serum are important in mediating the STS effect. In fact, in agreement with our in vitro findings, in vivo FMD + vitamin C reduced blood levels of transferrin bound iron (Fig. 4 g ). Our data further support the role of iron as a key factor in the serum whose reduction was responsible for the synergism of FMD and vitamin C.\n\nFMD and vitamin C potentiate oxaliplatin cytotoxic effects. A number of studies described the tolerability and potential efficacy of high-dose vitamin C as an adjuvant treatment during chemotherapy ${ }^{2,3,32,33}$. In addition, our group has recently shown the effectiveness of fasting or FMD cycles in combination with chemotherapy to reduce tumor growth in a wide range of cancer types compared with standard chemotherapy alone ${ }^{17,31}$.\n\nDrawing from our previous data, we investigated whether FMD + vitamin C would sensitize KRAS-mutated cancer cells to the pro-oxidant action of chemotherapy in vivo, possibly by increasing cellular oxidative stress. We chose oxaliplatin because it is one of the most effective cytotoxic compounds used in the adjuvant and advanced setting of CRC treatment ${ }^{34}$. Of note, the FMD + vitamin C combination was as effective as oxaliplatin + FMD or oxaliplatin + vitamin C, supporting the powerful action of these non-toxic combinations in halting tumor growth (Fig. 5a).\n\nMoreover, triple treatment (FMD + vitamin C + chemotherapy) was the most active therapeutic intervention in delaying tumor progression in a mouse xenograft and in extending survival in a syngeneic model (Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. 8). These results indicate that chemotherapy can further potentiate the effects of FMD + vitamin C against $K R A S$ mutated cancers.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn preclinical experiments, fasting reduces tumor progression and sensitizes different tumor types to chemotherapy, while protecting normal cells through a mechanism that can involve the reduction of blood IGF-1 and glucose levels ${ }^{17,19,22}$. Oxidative stress also contributes to the anticancer properties of fasting ${ }^{17,25}$.\n\nSince prolonged water-only fasting remains a challenging option for cancer patients, FMDs have been recently proposed as more feasible and equally effective interventions ${ }^{23,24,31}$.\n\nHere, we focused on the identification of a low-toxicity treatment consisting of the combination of FMD cycles with pharmacological dosages of vitamin C for the treatment of KRAS mutated cancers. Recently, Yun and colleagues reported that high-dose vitamin C is selectively toxic to KRAS and BRAF mutated CRC cells, proposing that vitamin C could have therapeutic applications in the treatment of these aggressive neoplasms ${ }^{4}$. This effect is due to an enhancement in the uptake of the oxidized form of vitamin C (DHA) via GLUT1 glucose transporter, which is upregulated in these highly glycolytic cancer cells. Here, we found that the anticancer effect of vitamin C can be potentiated in different in vitro and in vivo mouse models by STS/FMD treatment selectively in $K R A S$-mutant cancers, through a mechanism that is independent of glucose, but that involves differential regulation of $\\mathrm{HO}-1$. Of note, $\\mathrm{HO}-1$ is frequently overexpressed in several tumors in response to chemotherapy, thus representing a potential resistance mechanism and poor prognostic factor in some cancer types ${ }^{35-38}$. Our data suggest that unlike for $K R A S$-mutated cancer cells, where FMD reverts the vitamin C-mediated HO-1 upregulation, $K R A S$-wild-type tumors are more resistant to oxidative insults, possibly because of their ability to rapidly neutralise radical species, ${ }^{4,11,12,27}$. The differential modulation of HO-1 expression in KRAS-mutant and $K R A S$-wild-type cells can, at least in part, explain the differential response to oxidative damage and thus the sensitivity to vitamin C (Supplementary Fig. 9). The unresponsiveness of $K R A S$-wildtype cells to vitamin C + fasting/FMD does not mean that either vitamin C or fasting/FMD cannot contribute to toxicity against this type of cancer cells, since combination with additional treatments such as chemotherapy could yield additive effects as shown for many other cancer models ${ }^{17}$.",

The current results pointing to the iron binding and transporting proteins as mediators of cancer cell resistance to therapy, together with our previous works, support that FMD cycles, by altering a wide range of nutrients, growth factors,\nplasma and cellular proteins and metals, are able to affect a wide range of escape routes required for the survival or resistance acquisition of different tumors. The high toxicity of the combination of the FMD together with vitamin C against $K R A S$ mutated tumors, provides a clear example of how a non-toxic therapy combining both wide-acting (FMD) and targeted (vitamin C) antitumor mechanisms can be as or more effective in delaying cancer progression in mice as/than standard antitumor therapies that are much more toxic to normal cells and organs.",

Successfully infected cells were selected using $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ puromycin.\n\nProtein extraction and Western blot analysis. Cells were grown in CTR or STS media with or without holo-transferrin or hemin and then treated with vitamin C $(350 \\mu \\mathrm{M})$ or vehicle for 3 h . Next, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysates were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris $\\mathrm{HCl} \\mathrm{pH} 7.4,150 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{NaCl}$, $1 \\%$ NP-40, $0.25 \\%$ deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail set III EDTA-free, Calbiochem, Cat. \\#: S39134; PhosStop, Roche). Samples were sonicated (Bioruptor Plus, Diogenode) and centrifuged at $16.1 \\times g$ for 30 min at $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Tumor tissues were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after mice were sacrificed, and stored in $-80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ until use. For protein extraction, tumors were homogenized with Tissue lyser II (Qiagen) in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and then ultra-centrifuged ( $122,245 \\times g$ using a MLA-130 Beckman rotor) for 1 h . Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. \\#: 23225).

        "text": "SuperScript Vilo cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, \\#11754050). Resulting cDNA (1/ $20 \\mathrm{v} / \\mathrm{v}$ ) was analyzed by real-time polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) using QuantStudio 12 K flex Real Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Human target gene primers for heme-oxygenase-1 (HMOX1:Hs01110250_m1, ThermoFisher Scientific) were utilized. Target transcript levels were normalized to those of a reference gene (GAPDH: hs99999905_m1, ThermoFisher Scientific). To confirm KRAS overexpression in HT29 cell line mRNA levels were detected using SYBR Green GoTaq ${ }^{\\circledR}$ qPCR Master Mix (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the used primer were CGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATTAAG (ACTIN FW), TGATCTCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGG (ACTIN REV), GGGGA GGGCTTTCTTTGTGTA (KRAS FW) and GTCCTGAGCCTGTTTTGTGTC (KRAS REV). Gene expression was normalized to housekeeping gene expression ( $\\beta$-Actin). Comparisons in gene expression were calculated using the $2^{-\\Delta \\Delta C t}$ method.\n\nMouse models. The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at $22 \\pm 2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ with $55 \\pm 10 \\%$ relative humidity and with 12 h day/light cycles. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines established in the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (directive 86/609/EEC), were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health, and were performed under the supervision of the institutional organism for animal welfare (Cogentech OPBA). For xenograft experiments, 8 -week-old female NOD scid gamma (NSG, Charles River) were subcutaneously injected with $2 \\times 10^{6}$ HCT116 cells (NCI 60 panel) resuspended in $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~L}$ of PBS. For syngeneic model, 8 -week-old female BALB/cOlaHsd mice (Envigo) were subcutaneously injected with $3 \\times 10^{5}$ CT26 (ATCC) cells resuspended in $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~L}$ of PBS. When tumors were palpable ( 7 days after inoculation), mice were randomly divided in the different experimental groups. Body weights were recorded daily, and tumor volumes were measured every $2-3$ days by a digital vernier caliper according to the following equation: tumor volume $\\left(\\mathrm{mm}^{3}\\right)=$ (length $\\times$ width $^{2}$ ) $\\times 0.5$, where the length and width are expressed in millimeters. For the orthotopic model, the animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Southern California. Female BALB/c mice (8-week old, strain 000651-Jackson Laboratory) were anesthetized with isoflurane anaesthesia. Mice then received a gentle anal dilation using blunt-tipped forceps at the anal opening. A 29 -gauge syringe was used to inject $2.5 \\times 10^{4}$ CT26-luc cells (SC061-LG GenTarget Inc), suspended in saline, submucosally into the distal, posterior rectum. Seven days later, mice were randomly divided in the different experimental groups. Twenty-one days post injections mouse imaging was performed using the Xenogen IVIS-200 System. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane anaesthesia and luciferin ( $50 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$ body weight) was administered via intra-peritoneal injections and animals were subjected to Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) at the USC Small Animal Imaging Center. Bioluminescent imaging data were analysed by Living Image 4.3.1. At the end of the experiments, mice were euthanized by using $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.\n\nAnimal diets and treatments. Mice were fed ad libitum with irradiated VRFI (P) diet (Charles River) containing $3.89 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{g}$ of gross energy. Our FMD diet is based on a nutritional screen that identified ingredients that allow nourishment during periods of low calorie consumption ${ }^{23}$. The FMD diet consists of two different components designated as day 1 diet and days 2-4 diet. Day 1 diet contains $7.67 \\mathrm{~kJ} /$ g (provided $50 \\%$ of normal daily intake; $0.46 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{g}$ protein, $2.2 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{g}$ carbohydrate, $5.00 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{g}$ fat); the day $2-4$ diet contains $1.48 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{g}$ (provided at $10 \\%$ of normal daily intake; $0.01 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{g}$ protein $/$ fat, $1.47 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{g}$ carbohydrates). Before FMD diet was supplied, mice were transferred in fresh cages to avoid residual chow feeding and coprophagy. Mouse weight was monitored daily and during FMD cycle, weight loss did not exceed $20 \\%$.\n\nFor experiments on tumor growth, mice were fed with standard rodent diet or underwent FMD cycles (3 days each). In experiments with chemotherapy, the second FMD cycle was reduced to 2 days because the faster rate of body weight loss. Before FMD cycle was repeated, mice completely recovered their original bodyweight.\n\nFor vitamin C experiments, mice undergoing standard feeding or at the last day of the first FMD cycle started to be treated with vitamin C ( $4 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{kg}$ in saline) via intraperitoneal injection twice a day, every day until the end of the experiment. At least $6-8 \\mathrm{~h}$ have elapsed between the two administrations in each day.\n\nFor chemotherapy experiments, mice undergoing standard feeding or at the second day of the first FMD cycle started to be treated with vitamin C twice a day (until day 36), and during the last day of each FMD cycle ( 24 h before refeeding), mice were treated with oxaliplatin ( $10 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$ ) via intraperitoneal injection once every 15 days for NSG and 11 days for Balb/c mice (according to the mouse body weight recovery). When mice were treated with chemotherapy, vitamin C injection was skipped. At least $8-9 \\mathrm{~h}$ have elapsed between vitamin C and oxaliplatin administrations.\n\nIn vivo iron-bound transferrin measurement. For iron-bound transferrin measurement, mouse blood was collected from the heart of mice sacrificed at the end of second FMD cycle and 24 h post-refeeding. Blood was incubated at room temperature $\\left(25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ for at least 30 min to clot and then centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 $\\times g\\left(4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. Collected serum was aliquoted and stored at $-80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Iron-bound\ntransferrin was measured by Serum Iron Assay kit (Biovision, \\#K392) according to manufacturer protocol.\n\nTCGA patient's analysis. TCGA-COAD patient information, including gender, mutational status and clinical data, could be retrieved through GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-COAD). Sequencing of human subjects' tissue was performed by TCGA consortium members under a series of locally approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols as described in (Cancer Genome Atlas Network (2012)). Informed consent was obtained from all human participants.\n\nMolecular data and clinical information including KRAS status and, survival and RNA-seq FTH1 mRNA expression data in TCGA-COAD ( $n=266$ ) samples were collected from GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) and TSVdb ${ }^{39}$ respectively. Patients with undefined survival time or without available RNA-seq data were excluded, only primary solid tumors were considered. KRAS-mutant tumors were selected according to the presence of a predicted deleterious mutation (DH; SIFT value <0.05). Patients were stratified according to the median tumor FTH1 mRNA expression level.\n\nStatistical analysis. GraphPad Prism v8.0.2 (159) was used for the analysis of the data and graphic representations. Comparisons between groups were performed with two-sided unpaired Student's $t$-test. One-way ANOVA analysis was used for comparison among multiple groups for mouse experiments. One-way ANOVA analysis was followed by Tukey's test post analysis. $P$ values $\\leq 0.05$ were considered significant. For in vivo experiments, we evaluated the sample size by G.Power software considering a multifactorial variance analysis. We obtained that $n=10$ mice per group can reach a power of 0.9 (subject to alpha $=0.05$ ). Outlier presence was checked and removed according to ROUT method (ROUT $=1 \\%$ ). A confidence interval of $95 \\%$ ( $P$ values $\\leq 0.05$ ) were considered significant. For survival analysis, the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed. For clinical data analysis, Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test was utilized. All data are represented as mean $\\pm$ SEM of at least three independent experiments.\n\nReporting summary. Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\n\nData availability\n\nAll patient's survival data that support the findings of this study are available in GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-COAD).
