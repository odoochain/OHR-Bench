Purpose of this Work.-The following notes are intended for nurses who, having already received training in general medical and surgical work, are entering grynecological wards. An acquaintance with the ordinary literature of nursing is presupposed throughout. To supplement not to supplant other works is the author's intention. Those who seek further information on the care of the sick in general will do well to consult such manuals as those of Dr. Cullingworth or Dr: Laurence Humphry, and others.\n\nNothing is more unsatisfactory than to have to qualify and be responsible for the performanice of duties which are undefined",

Experience as resident medical officer at one hospital for women, and as honorary surgeon to another, has led him to feel that a nurse who enters a special hospital will be materially assisted by a concise account of her new duties ; and as he is not aware of any publication which exactly meets this requirement in regard to gynacoological work, he has attempted to supply the want in the following pages.\n\nInstruction is here given in certain duties which in many hospitals no nurse is called upon to undertake. In other hospitals, however, where there is but a single resident officer, or no resident staff at all, in private nursing homes, and in cases in private practice, it is often a great convenience to the surgeon to be able to devolve such duties upon a competent nurse, and such a course is often very acceptable to the patient. Nurses, too, often stand in need of guidance in emergencies where no immediate skilled assistance is available.",

Granting the fundamental principle that a nurse only exercises her skill under authority and in accordance with instructions, there need be no narrow limit to the extent to which her skill is developed. As a matter of fact, a nurse who is already able to apply a roller bandage to the leg or scalp, or to pass a catheter sans voir, can readily be taught to give a hypodermic injection, to wash out a bladder, to pass a vaginal speculum, and remove a Hodge's pessary. In many such matters a nurse will soon be decidedly ahead of the average three-months clinical clerk or dresser.\n2.

Surgical Cleanliness is of supreme importance in gynæcological wards, and it is necessary that every nurse should understand the reason why such is the case. If she do not, many of the details here enjoined will seem needless and irksome, and she will have little spontaneous zeal for carrying them out; but if she clearly grasp how wound-poisoning arises and what it means, she will not only be anxious to guard against it by the observance of all enjoined precautions but will be able to apply the same principles in many circumstances where no forewarning has been possible.\n\nThe first point to be realised is that all dirt or foreign matter in or near a wound",

The absence of such dirt is implied by the term surgical cleanliness ; but this means not only freedom from foreign matter which is perceptible to sight or smell, but also from any germ or poison whatever ; and the presence of some of these all too easily escapes detection by the senses.\n\nThe worst of all kinds of dirt is that which arises from putrefying organic matter, for this contains a living poison, a poison which can grow and multiply like weeds in a garden, or mould in a damp cellar, and its action can spread like that of yeast in dough. Whenever anything turns offensive or putrid such living poison germs swarm.\n\nIt must next be remembered that any raw surface, particularly a recent wound, is liable to absorb such material. So are the internal passages and cavities of the body. Dressings soaked with pus from an abscess, linen soiled by vaginal discharge, sponges soaked with blood, surgical instruments imperfectly cleaned, will all infallibly breed wound-poison if left alone ; and if the discharge be offensive, the poison is already",

If a sponge that had escaped washing were used to cleanse a recently sutured perineum, the whole wound might suppurate and the operation completely fail. If just after giving a vaginal douche to a septic case a muse took her place to hand sponges at an ovariotomy, the patient might die in consequence.\n\nEvery nurse will have been struck with the extreme difficulty of freeing the hands from odour when they have been fouled by offensive discharge. No amount of washing with soap and disinfectants seems to accomplish it. 'This is a valuable lesson in the subtleness and tenacity of the enemy we have to combat.\n\nConsidering that recent wounds are particularly liable to infection, and that in",

Avoid carrying poison to the patient. This embraces all we shall have to say hereafter concerning the surgical cleanliness of hands, sponges, dressings, instruments: and so on.\nII. Aroid giving wound-poison the opportunity of growing and multiplying. This especially includes the use of antiseptics and the rapid removal and destruction of everything which might become foul, such as the discharges from wounds.

It will be useful here to give a definition of certain terms frequently used.\n\nSepsis, as we have said, means wound-poisoning.\n\nSeptic means \"in a condition of sepsis,\" or \" causing sepsis.\"\n\nAsepsis means the absence of sepsis, and aseptic is the corresponding adjective. The term Antiseptic is applied to any material or agent which is not only free from septic matter, but has also the power of preventing or hindering its production and growth.\n\nFor instance, recently boiled water is aseptic ; so is perfectly clean linen ; so are new sponges properly prepared, new lint, wool, and simple dressings.\n\nBut solution of carbolic acid, sal-alembroth wool, boracic wool, etc., are antiseptic.
