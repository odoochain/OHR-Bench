By John Ingram Travers.\n\nGreat Britain is the Currant Market of the World: its consumption exceeding that of all other nations, and three-fourths of the entire produce being imported into this country.\n\nThe Morea furnishes us with three-fifths, and the Ionian Islands with two-fifths, of our supply.\n\nThe far greater proportion of the value of the Currants we import is paid for by our exports of British manufactures ; and during the five years 1851-5, our exports to the Ionian Islands have exceeded our imports thence by 177,1292 .\n\nThe carrying trade between the United Kingdom and the Currant-producing countries of the Mediterranean is principally carried on in British bottoms-to the extent in ships of 72 per cent., and in tonnage of 62 per cent. of the whole commercial marine employed.\n\nThe continuance of these advantages to the United Kingdom is now perilled by the high rate of Customs' Duties as contrasted with those imposed by the tariffs of other countries, those engaged in the cultivation of Currants being free to export their produce to the country most inviting their reception.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l}\nAustria and the States of the Zollverein & Â£ s. d. \\\\\nlevy a Customs' Duty of... & 11 - - per Ton. \\\\\nHolland & 1 16 8 \" \\\\\nFrance & - 5 - \" \\\\\nRussia & 4 - - \" \\\\\nUnited States, from July, 1857, about & 3 5 - \" \\\\\nThe United Kingdom & 15 15 - \"\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Customs Duties on Coal}\n\nThe average consumption per head of our population is but two ounces weekly, which the reduction of the duty to $5 l$. would immensely increase, and in all probability a much larger amount of revenue would be produced.\n\nWhen, in 1834, the duty was reduced from $44 l .6 s .8 d$. to $22 l .3 s .4 d$. , the consumption increased from 5,593 to 9,296 tons; and when, in 1844, the duty was reduced from $222.3 s .4 d$. to $15 l .15 s$., the consumption increased from 9,296 to 14,912 tons.\n\nBut, now that Russia has reduced her tariff by three-sevenths of its former amount, and the United States by four-fifths of what it has hitherto been, this country will be precluded from all chance of competition, except at high prices, and this trade will inevitably be sacrificed, with all its collateral advantages, unless we adopt a Free Trade Tariff, at least to an equal extent with other Nations-our competitors.",
