Faculty partnered with WikiProject Medicine, Wikipedia Education Program, and experienced Wikipedians to design, deliver and evaluate the elective.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe analyzed: 1) number of readers of the edited articles, 2) impact of the student edits on content, and 3) impact of the elective on students. Across 3 cycles, we obtained article traffic statistics via Wikipedia's publically available mechanisms. The 28 students received pre- and post-rotation surveys. Faculty members conducted mid-rotation 1:1 interviews and single, end-rotation focus groups. All qualitative data were coded for emerging themes. We calculated article quality metrics (number of bytes added/deleted, number and quality of citations added, etc.) We used a private content quality firm's proprietary reporting tool to calculate changes in article grammar, style, readability and translatability. Physician volunteers scored both pre- and post-editing versions of the Wikipedia pages to determine changes in overall quality.\n\nResults/Evaluation Plan:\n\nDuring only months that students actively edited, 28 articles were collectively viewed 974,065 times. Students contributed 1,084 edits (average 39/student); adding 369,994",

Students discovered a tension between readability and translatability vs. comprehensiveness of content. Feedback included that all: 1) felt they improved their articles; 2) enjoyed the opportunity to \"give back specifically\" to Wikipedia; and 3) broadened their scope of physician responsibilities in the socially-networked information era.\n\nDiscussion/Dissemination:\n\nThese results demonstrate viability of medical student Wikipedia contributions. We have presented this at several regional \\& international conferences and are drafting a manuscript for peer-review.",
