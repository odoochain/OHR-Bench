INTRODUCTION\n\nSoftware becomes crucial in daily life. Computers, commutation devices and electronics equipments every place we find software. The goal of every software industries is develop software which is error and fault free. Every industry is adopting a new testing technique to capture the errors during the testing phase. But even though some of the faults were undetected. These faults create the problems in future. Reliability is defined as the working condition of the software over certain time period of time in a given environmental conditions. Large numbers of papers are presented in this context. Testing effort is defined as effort needed to detect and correct the errors during the testing. Testing-effort can be calculated as person/ month, CPU hours and number of test cases and so on. Generally the software testing consumes a testing-effort during the testing phase [20 21].SRGM proposed by several papers incorporated traditional effort curves like Exponential, Rayleigh, and Weibull. The TEF which gives the effort required in testing and CPU time the software for better error tracking. Many papers are published based on TEF in NHPP models [4, 5, 8, 11, 120, 12, 20, 21]. All of them describe the tracking phenomenon with test expenditure.\n\nThis paper we used logistic-exponential testing-effort curve and incorporated in the SRGM. The result shows that the SRGM with logistic-exponential\n\nII. SOFTWARE TESTING EFFORT FUNCTIONS\n\nSeveral software testing-effort functions are defined in literature. $\\mathrm{w}(\\mathrm{t})$ is defined as the current testing effort and $\\mathrm{W}(\\mathrm{t})$ describes the cumulative testing effort. The following equation shows the relation between the $\\mathrm{w}(\\mathrm{t})$ and $\\mathrm{W}(\\mathrm{t})$\n$$W(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} w(t) d t$$\n\nThe following are some of them\n\nA.

Logistic-exponential testing-effort:\n\nIt has a great flexibility in accommodating all the forms of the hazard rate function, can be used in a variety of problems for modeling software failure data.\n\nThe logistic-exponential cumulative TEF over time period ( $0, \\mathrm{t}$ ] can be expressed as [27]\n$W(t)=\\alpha \\times \\frac{\\left(e^{\\lambda \\times t}-1\\right)^{k}}{\\left(1+\\left(e^{\\lambda \\times t}-1\\right)^{k}\\right)}, \\quad t>0$\nAnd its current testing effort is\n$w(t)=\\frac{\\alpha \\times k \\times \\lambda \\times \\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda \\times t} \\times\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda \\times t}-1\\right)^{k-1}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda \\times t}-1\\right)^{k}\\right)^{2}} \\mathrm{t}>0$\n$\\alpha$ is the total expenditure, k positive shape parameter and $\\lambda$ is a positive scale parameter\n\nIII. Software Reliability Growth Models\nA. Software reliability growth model with logisticexponential TEF\nThe following assumptions are made for software reliability growth modeling [1, $8,11,20,21,22]$\n(i) The fault removal process follows the NonHomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP)\n(ii) The software system is subjected to failure at random time caused by faults remaining in the system.\n(iii) The mean time number of faults detected in the time interval ( $\\mathrm{t}, \\mathrm{t}+\\mathrm{A} \\mathrm{t}$ ) by the current test effort is proportional for the mean number of remaining faults in the system.\n(iv) The proportionality is constant over the time.\n(v) Consumption curve of testing effort is modeled by a logistic-exponential TEF.\n(vi) Each time a failure occurs, the fault that caused it is immediately removed and no new faults are introduced.\n(vii) We can describe the mathematical expression of a testing-effort based on following\n$$\\frac{d m(t)}{d t} \\times \\frac{1}{w(t)}=r \\times(a-m(t))$$\n(6)\n$$m(t)=a \\times\\left(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-r \\times(W(t)-W(0))}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting W(t) into Eq.(7), we get\n$$m(t)=a \\times\\left(1-\\exp \\left(-r \\times \\alpha \\times \\frac{\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda \\times t}-1\\right)^{k}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda \\times t}-1\\right)^{k}\\right)}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nThis is an NHPP model with mean value function with the Logistic-exponential testing-effort expenditure.\nNow failure intensity is given by\n$$\\lambda(t)=\\frac{d m(t)}{d t}=a \\times r \\times w(t) \\times \\mathrm{e}^{-r \\times W(t)}$$\n$$\\left.\\lambda(t)=\\frac{a \\mathrm{e} \\frac{r \\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda t}-1\\right)^{k}-\\lambda t-\\lambda t\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda t}-1\\right)^{k}}{1+\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda t}-1\\right)^{k}}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda t}-1\\right)^{k}\\right)^{2}} r \\alpha k \\lambda\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\lambda t}-1\\right)^{k-1}\\right)$$\n\nThe expected number of errors detected eventually is\n$$m(\\infty)=a$$\nB. Yamada Delayed S-shaped model with logisticexponential testing-effort function\n\nThe delayed ' S ' shaped model originally proposed by Yamada [24] and it is different from NHPP by considering that software testing is not only for error detection but error isolation. And the cumulative errors detected follow the Sshaped curve. This behavior is indeed initial phase testers are familiar with type of errors and residual faults become more difficult to uncover [1, 6, 15, 16]. From the above steps described section 3.1, we will get a relationship between $\\mathrm{m}(\\mathrm{t})$ and $\\mathrm{w}(\\mathrm{t})$. For extended Yamada S-shaped software reliability model.The extended S-shaped model [24] is modeled by\n$$\\frac{d m_{d}(t)}{d t} \\times \\frac{1}{w(t)}=r_{1} \\times\\left[a-m_{d}(t)\\right]$$\nand\n$$\\frac{d m_{r}(t)}{d t} \\times \\frac{1}{w(t)}=r_{2} \\times\\left[a-m_{r}(t)\\right]$$\n\nWe assume $r_{2} \\neq r_{1}$ by solving 2 and 3 boundry conditions\n\n\n$$\\mathbf{m}_d(t) = 0, \\text{we have}\\\\\nm_d(t) = a \\times \\left(1 - e^{\\left[-r_1 \\times W^*(t)\\right]}\\right) \\text{and}\\\\\nm_r(t) = a \\times \\left[1 - \\frac{\\left(r_1 \\times e^{\\left[-r_2 \\times W^*(t)\\right]} - r_2 \\times e^{\\left[-r_1 \\times W^*(t)\\right]}\\right)}{r_1 - r_2}\\right]\n$$\n\nAt this stage we assume $\\mathrm{r}_{2} \\approx \\mathrm{r}_{1} \\approx \\mathrm{r}$, then using ' L ' Hospitals rule the Delayed S-shaped model with TEF is given by\n$$m(t) \\cong m_{r}(t)=a \\times\\left(1-\\left(1+r \\times W^{*}(t)\\right) \\times e^{\\left(-r \\times W^{*}(t)\\right]}\\right)$$\n\nThe failure intensity function for Delayed S-shaped model with TEF is given by\n$$\\lambda(t)=a \\times r^{2} \\times w(t) \\times W *(t) \\times \\mathrm{e}^{\\left[-r \\times W^{*}(t)\\right]}$$\n\nIV. EVALUATION CRITERIA\n\nA. The goodness of fit technique\n\nHere we used MSE [5, 11, 17, 23 ]which gives real measure of the difference between actual and predicted values. The MSE defined as\n$$M S E=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\left[m\\left(t_{i}\\right)-m_{i}\\right]^{2}}{k}$$\n\nA smaller MSE indicate a smaller fitting error and better performance.",

MODEL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\n\nA. DS1:\n\nThe first set of actual data is from the study by Ohba 1984 [15].the system is PL/1 data base application software ,consisting of approximately $1,317,000$ lines of code .During nineteen weeks of experiments, 47.65 CPU hours were consumed and about 328 software errors are removed.\n\nFitting the model to the actual data means by estimating the model parameter from actual failure data. Here we used the LSE (non-linear least square estimation) and MLE to estimate the parameters. Calculations are given in appendix A\n\n\nFig 1. Observed/estimated logistic-exponential and Rayleigh TEF for DS1.\n\nAll parameters of other distribution are estimated through LSE. The unknown parameters of Logistic-exponential TEF are Ã¡=72(CPU hours), Ã«=0.04847, and $k=1.387$. Correspondingly the estimated parameters of Rayleigh TEF $\\mathrm{N}=49.32$ and $\\mathrm{b}=0.00684 /$ week. Fig. 1 plots the comparison between observed failure data and the data estimated by Logistic-exponential TEF and Rayleigh TEF. The PE, Bias, Variation, MRE and RMS-PE for Logistic-exponential and Rayleigh are listed in Table I. From the TABLE I we can see that Logistic-exponential has lower PE, Bias, Variation, MRE and RMS-PE than Rayleigh TEF. We can say that our proposed model fits better than the other one. In the TABLE II we have listed estimated values of SRGM with different testing-efforts. We have also given the values of SSE, $\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ and MSE. We observed that our proposed model has smallest MSE and SSE value when compared with other models.

Software Release-Time Based on Reliability Criteria\n\nGenerally software release problem associated with the reliability of a software system. Here in this first we discuss the optimal time based on reliability criterion. If we know software has reached its maximum reliability for a particular time. By that we can decide right time for the software to be delivered out. Goel and Okumoto [1] first dealed with the software release problem considering the software costbenefit. The conditional reliability function after the last failure occurs at time $t$ is obtained by\n$\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{t}+\\Delta \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{t})=\\exp (-[\\mathrm{m}(\\mathrm{t}+\\Delta \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{t})-\\mathrm{m}(\\mathrm{t})])$\n$=\\exp (-m(\\Delta t) \\times \\exp (-r \\times W *(t)))$\nTaking the logarithm on both sides of the above equation and rearrange the above equation we obtain\n$\\ln R=-m(\\Delta t) \\times \\exp (-r \\times W *(t))$\nthus\n$W *(t)=\\frac{1}{r}\\left[\\ln m(\\Delta t)-\\ln \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)\\right]$\nBy solving the eq 26 we can reach the desired reliability level. For DS1 $\\Delta t=0.1 \\mathrm{R}=0.91$ at $\\mathrm{T}=42$.1weeks\nB. Optimal release time based on cost-reliability criterion\n\nThis section deals with the release policy based on the cost-reliability criterion. Using the total software cost evaluated by cost criterion, the cost of testing-effort expenditures during software testing/development phase and the cost of fixing errors before and after release are: [9, 13, 251\n$$C(T)=C_{1} m(T)+C_{2}\\left[m\\left(T_{L C}\\right)-m(T)\\right]+C_{3}\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} w(x) \\mathrm{d} x\\right)$$\n\nWhere $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ the cost of correcting an error during testing, $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is the cost of correcting an error during the operation, $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ $>\\mathrm{C}_{1}, \\mathrm{C}_{3}$ is the cost of testing per unit testing effort expenditure and $\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{LC}}$ is the software life-cycle length.\n\nFrom reliability criteria, we can obtain the required testing time needed to reach the reliability objective R. Our aim is to determine the optimal software release time that minimizes the total software cost to achieve the desired software reliability. Therefore, the optimal software release policy for the proposed software reliability can be formulated\nas Minimize $C(T)$ subjected to $R\\left(t+\\right.$ Ãt/t)e\" $R_{0}$ for $C_{2}>C_{1} C_{3}$ $>0$, Ã $\\mathrm{t}>0,0<\\mathrm{R}_{0}<1$.\n\nDifferentiate the equation (30) with respect to T and setting it to zero, we obtain\n$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} T} C(T)=C_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~d}}{\\mathrm{~d} T} m(T)\\right)+C_{2}\\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} m\\left(T_{L C}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} T} m(T)\\right)\\right|+C_{3} w(T)$\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} m\\left(T_{L C}\\right)=0$\n$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} T} C(T)=C_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~d}}{\\mathrm{~d} T} m(T)\\right)+C_{2}\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} T} m(T)\\right)\\right]+C_{3} w(T)=0$\n$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} T} m(T)=\\lambda(T)$\n$\\frac{\\lambda(T)}{w(T)}=\\frac{c 3}{c 2-c l}$\n$a r \\mathrm{e}^{-r W(t)}=r(a-m(T))$\nWhen $\\mathrm{T}=0$ then $\\mathrm{m}(0)=0$ and $\\frac{\\lambda(T)}{w(T)}=a r$\nWhen T-> $\\rightarrow \\infty$, then $m(\\infty)=a$\nAnd $\\frac{\\lambda(T)}{w(T)}=a \\times r \\times \\mathrm{e}^{-r \\times \\alpha} \\quad$ therefore $\\frac{\\lambda(T)}{w(T)}$ is monotonically decreasing in T .\n\nTo analyze the minimum value of $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{T}) \\mathrm{Eq}$.
