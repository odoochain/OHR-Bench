        "text": "OPTIMUM FORMS OF BODIES WITH ASSOCIATED SHOCK WAVES\nA. V. Shipilin (Moscow)\n\nThe problem is discussed of finding the form of two-\n\n\ndimensional and axisymmetric bodies guaranteeing the minimum wave drag in the supersonic flow of an ideal gas. The solution is sought among those bodies which -- when flow passes around them -- give rise to associated shock waves. Limitations on the contour of the body are arbitrary: One may pre-assign the dimensions of the body, its volume, area, etc. Similar problems with arbitrary isoperimentric conditions can be solved by a method proposed in (Refs. 1, 2). This method consists of using the exact equations of gas dynamics, describing the flow, as supplementary constraints. In the articles (Refs. 3-6) this method was further developed during the solution of a number of problems.\n\n1. Let x and y be the coordinate axes (Figure 1), $a b$-- the contour of the desired body, $a c$-- the associated shock wave, bc -- the characteristic of the second family, cd -- the characteristic of the first family. It is assumed that inside the region $a b c$ the flow is supersonic, and there are no shock waves. The incoming stream is uniform. Let $u$ and $v$ be the projections of the velocity on the axes $x$ and $y$, let $p$ denote the pressure, $\\rho--$ the density of the gas, $\\psi-$ the stream function, where\n$$d \\psi=y^{v} \\rho(u d y-v d x)$$\n$\\nu=0$ and 1 correspondingly, respectively, to the two-dimensional and the axisymmetric case. Here all the quantities are considered to be dimensionless, and $\\psi$ at the body will be taken as equal to zero.\n\nThe problem is analyzed in terms of the variables $\\psi, y$. The stationary, non-isotropic flow of the gas inside the region $a b c$ is described by the equations\n$$\\begin{gathered}\nL_{1} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial y^{v} p}{\\partial \\psi}-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}=0, \\quad L_{2} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi} \\frac{u}{v}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\frac{1}{y^{v} \\rho v}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{w^{2}}{2}+\\frac{x p}{(x-1) \\rho}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{x+1}{x-1}, \\quad \\frac{p}{\\rho^{x}}=\\varphi^{x-1}(\\psi) \\\\\n\\ddot{w}=\\sqrt{u^{2}+\\dot{v}^{2}}\n\\end{gathered}$$\n\nHere $x$ is the adiabatic exponent; $\\phi$ is the entropy function. The wave drag is expressed by the functional\n$$\\chi=\\int_{y_{a}}^{y_{b}} p[x(y)] y^{v} d y$$\n\nThe coordinate $y_{b}$ may be either fixed or arbitrary, depending on the conditions imposed on the contour of the body.

Let us find a function $x$ (y) realizing the extremum of the functional (1.2), satisfying the isoperimetric conditions (1.3), and at the same time satisfying the constraint (1.4) along $a b$ and the equations (1.1) in the region $a b c$.

Then, according to (Ref. 7), the functions which are found provide the extremum of the original functional (1.2) for the pre-assigned restrictions.\n2. We shall calculate the first-order variation of the functional I. We should note that in the plane $\\psi y$ the location $a b$ of the body and the location $a c$ of the shock wave are fixed. Only the location of the points $b$ and $c$ may change. The form of the characteristic bc changes when the flow is varied in the region $S$.

The first term in equation (2.10) is calculated for the shock wave, and the terms lying outside the integral, which are contained in $A$, are calculated along the characteristic $b c$ for the corresponding $\\psi$. By virtue of the conditions (2.4), (2.6) through (2.10), the first-order variation of the functional (1.5) vanishes.\n\nThe equations obtained constitute a system of necessary conditions determining the optimum contour. Given a certain contour $a b$, one can compute -for a given incoming flow -- the flow in the region $S$ which is a region of influence for $a b$. On the basis of the flow found, one can solve the Cauchy boundary problem for the multipliers $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ satisfying the system of equations (2.4) and the boundary conditions (2.7). The contour $a b$ should be chosen in such a way that the flow parameters and the functions $h_{1}$, $h_{2}$ satisfy the conditions (2.9) and (2.10). In fact, the part ad (Figure 1) of the contour determines the flow in the region adc and the shock wave ac -- i.e., the angle $\\sigma$ as a function of $\\psi$. The part $d b$ for data pertaining to the characteristic dc determines the flow in the region bcd and the characteristic bc. Thus, two functions are not pre-assigned, and by controlling them one can satisfy the conditions (2.9) and (2.10). Moreover, we have $n$ arbitrary constants $\\gamma_{i}$, which are chosen in such a way that they should satisfy $n$ isoperimetric conditions (1.3). The constant of integration $\\gamma^{*}$ is found from the condition that the equalities (2.7) and (2.9) should be simultaneously satisfied at the point $b$. If the value of $y_{b}$ is not pre-assigned, then to find it we have the condition (2.8).\n3. We shall now study the relations (2.9) and (2.10) at the point $c$. The integral terms, entering in (2.10), vanish at this point. The conditions (2.9) and (2.10) with respect to $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ represent a homogeneous system of two linear algebraic equations. If $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are not equal to zero, then the determinant of this system should vanish. Since all the flow parameters at the point in question are determined in terms of $\\sigma$, we obtain the same condition for $\\sigma$ in the case of $\\psi=\\psi_{c}$\n$$\\varepsilon \\equiv \\chi \\rho \\omega \\sin ^{2} \\theta-\\frac{1}{\\varphi} \\frac{d \\varphi}{d \\sigma} \\rho_{0} w_{0} \\sin ^{2} \\sigma[x \\sin \\theta-\\cos \\alpha \\sin (\\theta-\\alpha)]=0$$\n\nThis means that the solution of the problem formulated in this way exists. only for certain special relations between the parameters of the incoming flow and the conditions (1.3) imposed on the body. In the general case, if $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are continuous at $c$, one cannot satisfy the conditions (2.9) and (2.10) simultaneously.

In (Ref. 3), the discontinuous Lagrange multipliers were first discussed in connection with the application to variational problems of gas dynamics. It was shown that it is only the characteristics which can serve as the lines of discontinuity, and the derivation of the conditions for the discontinuities was given. The problems of gas dynamics in connection with the utilization of discontinuous Lagrange multipliers were also investigated in (Ref. 5).\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nWe shall divide the region $S$ into three subregions, as it is shown in Figure 2. Here $d c_{1}$ is the characteristic of the second family. Let us consider the equations (1.1) in the subregions $S_{i}$ with the help of the multipliers $h_{1}^{(i)}$ and $h_{2}^{(i)}$. Inside each of the subregions, the multipliers are determined with the aid of the system of equations (2.4), and the multipliers satisfy the conditions (2.7) in the parts ad and db . In calculating the first-order variation, we must deal with integrals along the characteristics $d c_{1}$ and $c d$, containing under the integral sign the variations $\\delta u, \\delta v$, and $\\delta \\sigma$. Considering that the flow parameters and their variations are continuous in $d c_{1}$ and $c d$, we find that the coefficients of $\\delta u, \\delta v$, and $\\delta \\sigma$ will contain $\\Delta h_{1}$ and $\\Delta h_{2}$ where $\\Delta h_{1}, \\Delta h_{2}$ are the discontinuities of the multipliers. Equating to zero the expressions multiplying $\\delta u$ and $\\delta v$, we shall obtain two conditions for the discontinuities. Along the characteristics, these conditions are linearly dependent.

Thus, for example, if $\\Delta h_{1}$ is given at one point of the characteristic, one can determine from (3.2) and (2.5) the discontinuity of the multipliers along the entire characteristic. The condition (2.9) will not change with the introduction of discontinuous multipliers, and the condition (2.10) will assume the form\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& E \\equiv \\begin{cases}N h_{2}^{(2)}-\\Delta h_{1}^{(1)} B+A=0 & \\left(\\psi_{c_{1}} \\leqslant \\psi \\leqslant \\psi_{c}\\right) \\\\\nN h_{2}^{(3)}-\\Delta h_{1}^{(1)} B+\\Delta h_{1}^{(2)} C+A=0 & \\left(\\psi_{a} \\leqslant \\psi \\leqslant \\psi_{c_{2}}\\right)\\end{cases} \\\\\n& \\Delta h_{1}^{(1)}=h_{1}^{(2)}-h_{1}^{(1)}, \\quad \\Delta h_{1}^{(2)}=h_{1}^{(3)}-h_{1}^{(2)} \\\\\n& B=\\frac{p \\sin (\\theta+\\alpha)}{\\rho w \\sin \\alpha}-v \\operatorname{tg} \\alpha, \\quad C=\\frac{p \\sin (\\theta-\\alpha)}{\\rho w \\sin \\alpha}-v \\operatorname{tg} \\alpha\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nHere $\\Delta h_{1}{ }^{(1)}$ and $B$ are taken along the characteristic $c d$, and $\\Delta h_{1}{ }^{(2)}$ and $C$-- along $d c_{1}$.

In this case, $h_{1}=1$ at the point $d$ when we approach it either from the left or from the right. It may be readily seen that the second condition (2.7) is not satisfied on the left of the discontinuity. Therefore, at $d$ the flow parameters should break down, and this is provided by the introduction of a break in the contour $a b$ at that point. The discontinuities $\\Delta h_{1}(2)$ and $\\Delta h_{2}(2)$, propagating along $d c_{1}$, will reach the point $c_{1}$ located on the shock wave.

Only in the special case, when the preassigned aspect ratio is such that the condition (3.1) is satisfied, does the wedge guarantee minimum wave drag. For the axisymmetric case, in the case of an associated shock wave the corresponding class of smooth bodies was found in the work (Ref. 10). An analogous result for a non-uniform, incoming flow was obtained in (Ref. 11). In the article (Ref. 12) with the same formulation of the problem as in (Ref. 9), but for larger Mach numbers, it was shown that the wave drag for a fixed lifting power and bodies similar to a wedge decreases with the introduction of an infinite number of breaks of positive and negative signs.\n\nFor purposes of simplicity, we shall consider first the flow structure/15 (figure 4) which is determined by one break of the contour at the point $d$.

We shall compute the variation of the part of the functional I, referring to the region dmend, which will be denoted by $\\tau$. The partial derivatives with respect to $y$, which are contained in the differential equations (1.1), become infinite at point $d$. Therefore, the variation of the double integral -- when the point $d$ is varied -- may not be equal to zero.\n\nThe calculations were performed in accordance with the work by A. N. Krayko (Ref. 6). For this purpose, the double integral over the region $\\tau$ will be written in terms of the new independent variables $\\omega, \\psi^{*}$ which are related to $y, \\psi$ by the formulas\n$$\\psi^{*}=\\psi, \\omega=\\operatorname{arctg}\\left(\\psi / y-y_{d}\\right)$$\n\nIn terms of these variables, the derivatives contained in the integrand become finite, and the process of calculating the variation is analogous to the process described above. The expressions multiplying the variations $\\delta u, \\delta v$, and $\\delta \\sigma$ in the double integral -- after returning to the variables $\\psi$, y -- coincide with the corresponding expressions obtained in Section 2. Moreover, the function $y$, which enters in equations (1.1) and is not an independent variable, is also varied. From the conversion formulas (4.2), it follows that at any point of the region $\\tau$ the equality $\\delta y^{=} \\delta y_{d}$, is satisfied, where $\\delta y_{d}$ is the displacement of the point $y_{d}--\\quad$ quantity which can be taken in front of the integral sign.\n\nLet $f$ be one of the functions describing the flow in the regions $d c_{1} m d$ and $d n b d$, and $f *$-- the same function in the region $\\tau$. The variations of this function at the boundary of the region $\\tau$ can be expressed in the following way:\n$$\\delta f=\\Delta f-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\Delta y . \\quad \\delta f^{*}=\\Delta f-\\frac{\\partial f^{*}}{\\partial \\omega} \\Delta \\omega$$",

        "text": "Here $\\Delta y$ is a change in the ordinate of the point on the boundary for fixed $\\psi$, and $\\Delta \\omega$ is the corresponding change of $\\omega$. The quantity $\\Delta f$ represents the difference between the values of $f$ at the initial limit and the varied limit for fixed $\\psi$. It follows from the formulas (4.2) that $\\Delta \\omega=\\psi^{-1}\\left(\\delta y_{d}-\\Delta y\\right) \\sin ^{2} \\omega$, We shall combine the terms, entering in the contour integral along dmend and the double integral over the region $\\tau$, containing $\\delta y_{d}$. As was shown in (Ref. 6), the sum of all these terms, with the utilization of equations (1.1) and (2.4), may be reduced to\n$$\\delta y_{\\mathrm{d}} \\int_{\\omega_{+}}^{\\omega-}\\left[h_{1} y^{v} \\frac{d p}{d \\omega}+h_{2} \\frac{d}{d \\omega}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)\\right] d \\omega$$\nwhere $\\omega_{+}$is the angle of inclination of the characteristic $d m$ at point $d$, and $\\omega_{\\text {_ }}$ is the angle of inclination of the characteristic $d n$ at $d$. In the remaining\nterms of the contour integral, we shall change to the independent variables $\\psi, y$. On the sections $m d$ and $n d$, we shall collect the terms next to $\\Delta f$ to the right and to the left of the boundary. These expressions will vanish if $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are continuous. If they are discontinuous, however, then we shall obtain the condition (3.2) for the discontinuities. In the expressions, referr- $\\underline{16}$ ing to $\\Delta y$, along $m d$ and $n d$ all the partial derivatives can be converted to total derivatives by using (1.1). By again collecting the terms standing in front of the total derivatives to the left and to the right of the boundary, we shall obtain the expressions which vanish identically. If $h_{1}, h_{2}$ are continuous, this is obvious. If they are discontinuous, then, making use of (3.2), one can show that these expressions are the compatability conditions along the characteristics of the system (1.1). On the section $m c$ of the shock wave, $\\Delta y=0$ and $\\Delta f$ are expressed in terms of $\\delta \\sigma$. On the part on of the characteristic, the value $\\Delta f$ - $(\\partial f / \\partial y) \\Delta y$, which is equal to $\\delta f$, is left from the variation $\\delta f *$. By examining the expression multiplying $\\delta f$, we see that we obtain the same extremum conditions, as for the part $n b$.\n\nFinally, the extremum conditions will be the following. In the regions $S_{i}$, the equations (2.4) serve for the determination of $h_{1}(i)$ and $h_{2}(i)$. On the parts $a d$ and $d b$ of the contour, the formulas (2.7) hold. For the problem in question, they yield\n$$h_{1_{1}}^{(\\mathbf{1})}=h_{1}^{(3)}=1, \\quad h_{2}^{(1)}=h_{2}^{(3)}=\\lambda$$\n\nAt the point $d$, the following condition should be satisfied\n$$\\left(y^{\\nu} p+\\lambda \\frac{u}{v}\\right)_{+}-\\left(y^{\\nu} p+\\lambda \\frac{u}{v}\\right)_{-}+\\int_{\\omega_{+}}^{\\omega_{-}}\\left[h_{1} y^{v} \\frac{d p}{d \\omega}+h_{2} \\frac{d}{d \\omega}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)\\right] d \\omega=0$$\n\nHere the plus sign refers to the values at the point $d$ being approached from the left, and the minus sign -- to the corresponding values when the point $d$ is approached from the right. When the problem is studied as a whole (Figure 3), analogous equalities apply for the points $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$",

We shall substitute these expressions in the condition (2.9).\n\nWe find that the following equality is satisfied along the characteristic $n b$\n$$\\lambda=y^{\\nu} \\rho v^{2} \\operatorname{tg} \\alpha$$\nif the contour $b d$ has a minimum wave drag for the fixed characteristic $d n$. This relation was obtained in (Ref. 13) when the author examined the variational problem of constructing a generatrix with the fixed points $d$ and $b$ and a fixed characteristic $d n$. Hence it follows that it is more convenient to solve the opposite problem -- i.e., to find a shock wave $a c$ and a characteristic $b c$, satisfying the extremum conditions. After solving equations (1.1) numberically, these may then be used to construct the required contour $a b$.\n\nFor the numerical solution of the problem, the following iteration process is proposed. A point $m$ is given on the $y$-axis in the $x y$ plane. The segment $y_{m}-y_{a}$ is divided into $N$ equal parts with the ordinates $y_{k}(k=0,1, \\ldots, N)$. $\\sigma_{k}$ is given at each point $y_{k}$. In the xy plane, we construct the shock wave con which is the initial approximation to the original wave (Figure 4). From the data pertaining to the former, we may compute the flow in the region omd, and may select the contour ad of the body. Furthermore, we choose a certain break angle $\\Delta \\theta_{1}$ from which we may calculate the flow of rarefaction in the region dmed and may compile a part me of the shocl wave. From a certain chosen value $\\Delta \\theta_{2}$ of the break angle, we may calculate the region dond. At the point $n$, we compute $\\lambda$ according to formula (4.5).

From formulas (3.4) we compute $h_{1}{ }^{(2)}$ and $h_{2}{ }^{(2)}$ along the characteristic $c d$. Here $\\mu_{1}$ is determined by the condition that (2.9) and (3.3) be simultaneously satisfied at the point $c$. In the region dmed, the functions $h_{1}{ }^{(2)}$ and $h_{2}{ }^{(2)}$ are calculated by the method of characteristics from the data on the characteristic cd, and by drawing upon the condition (3.3) along the part cm of the shock wave. From formulas (3.4) and the known values of $h_{1}{ }^{(3)}$ and $h_{2}{ }^{(3)}$, we may determine $h_{1}{ }^{(2)}$ and $h_{2}{ }^{(2)}$ along the characteristic $c_{1} d$. The constant 117 $\\mu_{2}$ is found from the condition of continuity of $h_{1}^{(3)}$ and $h_{1}^{(1)}$ at the point $d$. The quantities $\\Delta \\theta_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\theta_{2}$ are chosen in such a way that the condition (4.4) and $h_{2}{ }^{(2)}+\\Delta h_{2}{ }^{(2)}=\\lambda$ is satisfied at the point $d$. After satisfying the conditions (4.3) and (4.4) at point $d$, by solving the Goursat problem between the characteristics $c_{1} d$ and $d m$, we may determine $h_{1}{ }^{(2)}$ and $h_{2}{ }^{(2)}$ in the region $d c_{1}$ md.\n\nIt may happen that the necessary values of the discontinuities of the multipliers $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ at the point $c_{1}$ are equal to zero, for the chosen computational accuracy. In this case, we can disregard the breaks at the points $\\mathrm{d}_{1}, \\mathrm{~d}_{2}, \\ldots$. . Then the function E at each of the points $\\mathrm{y}_{\\mathrm{k}}$ on the shock wave is calculated from the known flow and the known Lagrange multipliers. The inclination angles for the new shock wave $a m$ are found from the formula\n$$\\sigma_{j+1}\\left(y_{k}\\right)=\\sigma_{j}\\left(y_{k}\\right)+\\eta E_{j}\\left(y_{k}\\right)$$\nwhere $j$ is the number of the successive iteration, $\\eta$ is a certain number satisfying the condition $|n|<1 ; k=0,1,2, \\ldots, N-1$. At the point $m$, the (2) quantity $\\sigma\\left(y_{N}\\right)$ remains fixed, since $E=0$ by virtue of the choice of $h_{1}(2)$ and $h_{2}{ }^{(2)}$ along $c m$, when calculating the Lagrange multipliers inside the region dmed. The calculations are continued until the magnitude of $E$ is equal to zero at all points $y_{k}$. Then from the obtained shock wave $\\alpha m$, two break angles $\\Delta \\theta_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\theta_{2}$, and the characteristic $n b$ of the second family--subordinated to the condition (4.5)--we may construct the contour $\\alpha b$. This contour gives the solution of the problem, if the obtained point $b$ coincides with the given point. Two arbitrary parameters $y_{m}$ and $\\sigma_{N}$ allow us to solve the direct problem. The iteration process in the case of breaks at points $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ is analogous to the one described before.\n5.

Also the values of the discontinuities of the Lagrange multipliers at the points $c, d$, and $c_{1}$ are given.

The values of $\\Delta h_{i d}^{(2)}$ and $\\Delta h_{i c_{1}}^{(2)}$ are defined ( $i=1,2$ ) as $h_{i}{ }^{(3)}-h_{i}{ }^{(2)}$, which may be calculated at the points $d^{i c_{1}}$ and $c_{1}$. The point a in all the examples has the coordinates ( 0,0 ). From the table given it can be seen that the values of the reflected discontinuities at the point d are equal to zero, within the accuracy of the calculations in question. With this accuracy, in all the examples the optimum body profiles obtained have only one break at the point d. For examples 5 and 6 from the table, Figure 5 gives the dependence of $T=\\tan \\theta / \\tan \\theta_{k}$ on $x$ for the optimum profile, where $\\theta_{k}$ is the angle of the equivalentwedge, All the examples are located in the regions fgh and 3, shown in Figure 6. The curve $f g$ for each value of $w_{0}$ determines the wedge aspect ratio for which acoustic streaming sccurs when the fiow passes around the wedge. The curves $h g$ and $k l$ correspond to the values of the aspect ratio and of the incoming flow (References 9,10 ), for which the wedge ( $\\varepsilon=0$ ) will be the optimum form. In the regions $f g h$ and 3 , the value of $\\varepsilon$ is positive, and in region 2 it is negative.\n\nThe author is grateful to V.M. Borisov, A.N. Krayko, and Yu.D.
