It has been found that it is most expeditious to adjust the outermost slab first, since the $R^{2} l$ for this slab is less sensitive to the position of the other slabs. This slab is also the most important from the point of view of both weight and attenuation. Other slabs are then adjusted to give the same value. Table 6 shows essentially the same data as Table 5 for a different distribution of intermediate slabs demonstrating the relative insensitivity of the optimum position for the outermost slab.\n\nThe minimum in $R^{2} l$ for an intermediate $s l a b$ is shown in Table 7 .\nFurther experiments and calculations to check the shield weights quoted here are still underway.\n\nFast Neutron Dosimeter. This instrument, described in previous reports, was developed by the ORNL Health Physics and Instrument Divisions. It has been made water-proof and used in the lid tank for a few representative readings. Comparison with fast neutron estimates from thermal flux measurements shows the latter to have been somewhat low so that the shield thickness estimates have been increased. The reasons for the discrepancy are discussed below separately.\n\nShield for Reactor with Fe Reflector. Two and five-eights inches of Fe were inserted at the inside of a $\\mathrm{Pb}-\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{B}$ mock up in order more closely to approximate an engineered installation. The attenuation was not changed appreciably, indicating that $F e$ is approximately as efficient for neutrons and gammas as the $\\mathrm{Pb}-\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ it replaced. The data including an ideal shield weight calculation for 4 -ft diameter outside the iron, are shown in Table 8 .\n\nInterpretation of Dosimeter Data (E。P。Blizard) . Discussions with H. A. Bethe, F. Friedman, and M. Deutsch served to clarify an apparent discrepancy between the dosimeter determination of fast current and that inferred from thermal neutron flux measurements (see ORNL 768). The dosimeter indicated fast flux to be about three times higher than is indicated from a simple interpretation of thermal flux data. The difference is attributed primarily",

This discrepancy is hard to define quantitatively, but Wick's method will be applied to obtain an order of magnitude correction.\n(2) Although there is a dominant high energy which determines the local relaxation length, there is considerable extra lower energy neutron component for which the age to thermal is considerably smaller. This indicates that the \"displacement\" distance between the fast collision and thermal absorption will be about one-half of that predicted by the simpler treatment.\n\nThat this is so is indicated by an exact calculation of the density of second collisions in hydrogen which has recently been carried out by Nelson, Albert, and Mulliken of the ORNL Mathematics Panel. (1) Their results are as follows:\n(Ratio of second to first collision density in hydrogen):\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n $t$ & $\\nu=1$ & $\\nu \\bar{F} 1.222$ & $\\nu=1.5$ \\\\\n  10 & 2.97 & 2.83 & 2.67 \\\\\n15 & 3.35 & 3.17 & 2.98 \\\\\n20 & 3.62 & 3.41 & 3.20 \\\\\n25 & 3.83 & 3.61 & 3.37 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\nwhere $t$ is the distance from source in mean free paths and describes the variation of mean free path with energy of scattered neutrons as follows:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{\\lambda}=\\left[\\frac{E}{E^{\\prime}}\\right]^{\\nu / 2}$$\n\nNeutron Energy Spectrometer (F.

This reduced the effect of static charges forming on the glas. Various gas mixtures have been tried but the data remain to be analyzed.\n\nEmphasis has been changed from the single wire counter (ORNL 711) to a two anode coincident arrangement. This has worked very well in preliminary tests. A Po-Be spectrum indicates a better resolution than that obtained with the single anode. Several points of the $U^{235}$ spectrum were obtained using the thermal column water tank, and these points give a spectrum similar to that found by B. E. Watt (LA-718).\n\nMeasurements of Fast Neutrons in the Lid Tank Using Sulphur as a Detector (H. E. Hungerford). Measurements of fast neutrons have been made using sulphur as a detector in conjunction with the $33 \\% \\mathrm{~Pb}-\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ experiment in the lid tank. The reaction used is a $S^{32}(n, p) P^{32}$ reaction, which has a threshold of about 1 Mev . The half-life of the beta-active product is 14.3 days.\n\nSulphur in the form of ammonium sulphate, $\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right) \\mathrm{SO}_{2}$, was packed into a thin layer in appropriate containers and exposed between the lead slabs in the lid tank. After exposure the active phosphorus was chemically separated from the inert material using molybdic acid as the reagent. The yellow-green precipitate, ammonium phospho-molybdate, $\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{\\circ} 12 \\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$, was washed, dried, and mounted on suitable cards and counted. The counters were calibrated against the standard pile by using both indium foils and phosphorus in the form of monobasic ammonium phosphate, $\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$, suitably mounted.\n\nThe results of the measurements appear in Table 9 and Fig. 2. Results are reported on measurements taken out to 42 cm from the source plate. This distance was found to be the practical limit for reliable measurements. In these calculations the cross section for the $S(n, p) P$ reaction used was 285 millibarns (AEC Report NP-1254) and thermal activation cross sections for $P$ of . 23 barns and for indium of 138 barns as reported in Phys. Rev. 72, 888 (1947).\n\nThe measurements are fairly reproducible, but lack of identical conditions in the lid tank, uncertainty of the standardization of the counters, selfabsorption in the samples, and losses during chemical separation have all contributed to errors in the reported results. Work on the standardizing of the counters is still in progress. Because the indium betas are of lower energy",

H. Lewis*\nC. E. Clifford\nH. K. Marks\nM. K. Hullings\n\nTransmission of radiation through a liquid metal filled duct will be measured in a water tank above the thermal column on top of the $X-10$ pile. This experiment is designed primarily to determine the activation of sodium in a secondary coolant cycle for the case in which the liquid metal duct constitutes the primary neutron path from reactor to heat exchanger. Since this is of immediate interest to the KAPL submarine reactor project, that organization will supply the duct mock-up. Measurements may be made with the liquid metal duct empty as well as full, to check simple duct theory. In addition, the effect of varying the wall material from boron carbide to water will be investigated. Figures 3 and 4 show the duct and foil holders.\n\nThe source box and source box locator have been received from KAPL and are being installed in the tank. There are $24 \\mathrm{X}-10$ slugs in the box. This secondary source is estimated to give approximately $10^{7}$ fast flux. Background measurements of the thermal and epi-cadmium flux are being taken at various positions in the tank. A pile monitor for the thermal flux entering the source box has been installed and is being calibrated. The tube in the monitor is a boron lined ion chamber. Plans for a platform to be built around the water tank have been completed and construction will begin September 18. The first leg of the duct is expected to arrive from KAPL by September 30.\n\nSHIELD CALCULATIONS\n\nCalculations of Neutron Attenuation (F. H. Murray). Calculations for neutron attenuation in a shield composed of lead and water were made by the method outlined in ORNL 748. This method is based entirely on cross-section information, without the use of lid tank results. The calculated curves for * MPl.",

Podgor*). As a first step in the analysis of existing data on lead-water and iron-water systems, effective absorption cross sections for lead and iron are being deduced from the experimental attenuation curves. A preliminary value of 3.8 barns has been obtained for lead, but further geometric corrections will probably reduce this value somewhat.\n\nHeat Generation in Shields (T. Welton). Some simple calculations have been made of the heat sources in the reflector and shield of atypical reactor. The general conclusion reached is that a steel reflector, of three inches thickness and cooled by reactor coolant, can be followed almost directly by thermal insulation and a hydrogeneous layer without dissipating more than one percent of the reactor power in the hydrogeneous layer. Detailed considerations are presented in a memorandum, ANP-5015, entitled Distribution of Heat Sources in Reflector and Shield.\n\nShield Calculations (K. Keyes). The methods of shield computation devised during the summer by members of the $T A B$ are being checked and extended with the aim of placing at the disposal of design people a flexible and reliable recipe for calculating shield weights. It is hoped that such computations can also give effective guidance in some phases of the lid tank program.\n\nLarge Air Ducts in Shields (W. K. Ergen*). A memorandum (CF 50-8-1) was written while the $T A B$ was in session. It was intended to summarize the presently available information on the shielding for the air cycle. The main difficulty is the decrease in shield efficiency due to the enormous air ducts. Shielding considerations cannot eliminate the air cycle because there are numerous ways (some of which were listed) to circumvent the shielding difficulties, but each of these ways would introduce undesirable features into the air cycle and make it less competitive.\n\nThree theoretical approaches to the duct problem are available: the \"distributed density approach,\" the \"line of sight approach,\" and the following of neutron histories including those which involve scattering. All these approaches yield essentially lower limits for the shield weights, but these\n*NEPA.",

The first two approaches have been used at NEPA and gavewidely different results, mainly because of different engineering assumptions, and only secondarily because of the difference in estimation of the influence of the ducts.\n\nNo practical way of gamma shielding the air cycle reactor has been proposed and it appears that the shield weights would be prohibitive even if only partial gamma shielding at the air cycle reactor were attempted.\n\nThe necessary large air planes of the air cycle allow the use of $\\boldsymbol{r}^{2}$ attenuation, but this aggravates the problem of neutron-induced activity in the material surrounding the reactor.\n\nNEW SHIELD TEST FACILITY\nW. M. Breazeale and J. L. Meem\n\nThe work on the building and pool is well underway. The contractor now expects to be out of the building by Cctober 20. Laboratory employees will then move in and install the reactor, measuring equipment, etc. Instrument development for this facility is a joint effort between NEPA and ORNL.\n\nA schedule (CF 50-9-16) has been drawn up covering the installation and initial \"shake down\" period totaling three and a half months. After this a mock-up of the first shield will be tested. Design and construction of this mock-up will be started when the ANP Shielding Board finishes the preliminary design of an aircraft shield (October 16).\n\nThe neutron camera discussed in the last quarterly report has been built and tested with $U^{235}$ fission spectrum.

Coneybear, NEPA\n\nConstruction of the Oak Ridge Area Critical Mass Laboratory, Building 9213, is now essentially complete. The building was turned over to the operating staff on August 21,1950 , and experimental equipment is now being installed. Operations will commence sometime in October unless the procurement of essential experimental materials, such as graphite, beryllium, and uranium, causes a delay.\n\nEach assembly of fissionable and moderating material will be made in a supporting grid of square aluminum tubing. A sample section of sixteen tubes welded together has been received but preliminary tests showed that excessive warping was introduced in the welding. It appears necessary that the matrix be built with individual tubes held in place by an external frame. The required aluminum tubing has been received. Control and safety rods have been ordered and are scheduled for delivery early in October.\n\nIt has been agreed that among the early experiments will be an investigation of heavy metals as reactor reflectors. Specifications have been prepared of Type 310 stainless steel requirements in order to completely enclose the core by approximately eight inches of reflector.\n\nA report, Initial Program of ANP Critical Experiments (NEPA-1522), was issued stating details of the first experiments and some of the techniques to be used.",

Savage, ANP Division\n\nAs mentioned in the last ANP Quarterly Report, a new group of the Laboratory has been organized to do experimental engineering work for the ANP program. It is the function of the Experimental Engineering Group to develop the technology of large-scale handling of the coolants of the aircraftreactor, and to make mock-ups and engineering studies of the proposed components. It is intended that the fundamental research and initial development on all such matters as fuel elements, materials for containing corrosive liquids, and heat transfer properties of materials will be done by the other groups of the project whose work is described elsewhere in this report. The Experimental Engineering Group will take the basic information and design suggestions and will reduce them to engineering practice for the ARE.\n\nPresent personnel with the Experimental Engineering Group number 19, of whom four are technicians and the balance professional. Several additional technicians are to be added in order to permit 24-hour operations when necessary. During the past three months, attention has been directed principally toward program definition, laboratory installation and personnel acquisition. However, a few liquid metal loops have already been operated.\n\nBecause a primary requirement of the ARE is to establish the compatibility of materials, the experimental program is being carefully coordinated with the research programs of the Metallurgy Group, the Heat Transfer Group, the activities of the ANP General Design Group, and the corresponding activities of NEPA. All of the present work is devoted to establishing the compatibility of various metals with sodium and lithium over a range of temperatures reaching somewhat above $1500^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nThe subjects which will be considered in the course of the development of the project are listed below. Many of these tests will be of actual components of the ARE.\n1. Heat transfer--specific configurations (not fundamental).\n2.
