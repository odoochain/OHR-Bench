        "text": "Update to the 1983 Edition- December 1, 2010\n\nWheri I started work as the first municipal archeologist in the state of Maryland I was optimistic that the truths self evident in our relationship to the archeological record would help to structure the relationship of people and governments to the land.\n\nIf only we could transform the archeological record into a dimension of the ecology that was respected as being as essential and valuable as any other. We have been taught to respect the air, the ground water and now we are expected to recycle and refrain from pollution. Why could we not extend this awareness to the archeolgocial record?\n\nThe awareness that I sought required archeology to become a part of the life way. The interface between the record and all human activity needed to be respected at all times. Awareness could not be limited to significant sites nor could it neglect the presence and absence information inherent in artifacts found without context. Just as one would never pollute the earth or ground water one would never disturb the earth unnecessarily and when necessary take steps to always record what was present scientifically and care for the artifacts and information responsibly.\n\nWhile I was fortunate to have my archeological program recogriized by the City of Laurel, Maryland, even though it was not funded. At the first instant of its implementation I found myself hauled in before the city administrator and mayor who steamrolled careless development and essentially shut my program down.\n\nToday writing in 2010 I see some but very little progress. The Archeological environment in contrast with other dimensions of ecology is neglected and respect for it is still not a part of the life way. We have to depend upon limited government mandates and even then we find negotiations rather than insistence that the environment is treated scientifically at all times.\n\nGovernmental and benevolent funding can not and never will be able to accomplish what can be done wher like recycling, archeological awareness is brought into the life way of each and every citizen always.\n\nThis publication brings together important drawings, maps, ecological and soil studies and observations which demonstrate the existence of an important Archeological environment in Laurel, Maryland. I hope that by granting greater access that someday that environment will be respected by one and all.\n\nI hereby grant permission for this document to be utilized freely including publication without further permission providing that it is cited accurately and completely.\n\nConrad Bladey\ncbladey@verizon.net\n402 Nancy Ave. Linthicum, Md. 21090\nor: PO Box 268 Linthicum, Maryland",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nHuman cultural history within the study area known as Laurel, Maryland has remained a dark confusing unknown across which generations of city planners and Laurel residents have stumbled repeatedly in recent centuries and decades. A prerequisite to understanding any history is an accurate and high level description of the human and natural setting in which such history occurs. This study has made a beginning in the process of description so essential to future fieldwork and final explanation. In the chapters that follow an attempt has been made to document the present state of our knowledge, our predictions for future discoveries, and the basic and broad trends of human adaptation in Laurel. It is hoped that following from this work will be a more complete study of the underlying cross-currents of multi-lineal evolutionary adaptation which helped to weave the basic patterns in the tapestry of Laurel's history. From these basic trends we shall build a path to the understanding of particular selections and a final explanation of this particular evolutionary course. Thus, by accounting for the past we may be more able to account for the selections of the future.",

The area of study is defined by both natural, technological, and cultural/ urban boundries (maps 1, 2).\n\nThe Patuxent River running northwest to southeast forms the boundary between Howard and Prince George's Counties; its banks on the Howard County side define the northern boundary of the study area.\n\nThe Walker Branch, which flows into the Patuxent at the transitional Fall Line zone between the Piedmont and and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, will be considered the northwest boundary.\n\nThe Crow Branch defines the southern boundary of the study area and serves both as an urban and natural boundary.\n\nThe $B$ \\& O railroad track, laid in 1835, forms a transportation and technological boundary reflecting a soils/ ecological boundary. The railroad tracks are also located on the Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County line, that marks the eastern boundary of the study area.",

        "text": "Soils\n\nThere are nine varieties of soil in the study area. These soils vary in characteristics of slope, drainage, and potential for supporting plant and animal populations.\n\nWithin the boundaries of the study area the most abundant soil type is the Beltsville Urban land complex, followed by Beltsville silt loam. The other soils present, in order of predominance are: Leonardtown silt loam, Manor loam, Bibb silt loam, Croom gravelly sandy loam, Comus silt loam, Ochlockonee silt loam (local alluvium) and Hyde silt loam. Slopes range from $0 \\%$ to $60 \\%$ while the average slopes are $5 \\%$ to $15 \\%$. Soil drainage ranges from poor to excessive with more soils having poor drainage.\n\nThese soils currently have the potential to support a variety of plant and animal communities. Open land wildlife may include: rabbits, deer, quail, and pheasants; while woodland wildlife may include: deer, squirrel, turkey and birds. Wetland environments may support raccoon, muskrat, duck and geese populations (USDA 1967: 155). Plants ranging from grain and seed crops in open lands to hardwood and coniferous trees and shrubs in woodlands are well suited to these soils.\n\nWithin the study area approximately $5 \\%$ is currently open land, $25 \\%$ is woodland, and $5 \\%$ is wetland. The remaining $65 \\%$ is urban development.",

The soils in the Beltsville series have a thick, very compact fragipan in the lower subsoil (USDA 1967: 16). They have only a moderate effective depth for agricultural purposes. Most of the previously mentioned soils are moderately to severely eroded and require special precautions if used agriculturally. Poor soil drainage is a problem for the urban complex within the study area and control measures are required for development (USDA 1967: 17). Permiable and acidic soils adversely effect preservation of organic and metallic remains except when sandy/clay spring soils are present, in which case concretion barriers are formed. These sandy/clay spring soils are present in the study area.\n\nSoils will be further discussed in the section on physiographic provinces.",

Crystalline Laurel migmatite is present in a small portion of the study area and Wicomico sediments form a distinctive boundary for the area of study (map 4).\n\nThe Patuxent formation consists of large round pebbles, fine white, pink, or yellow sand and thin lenses of white or iron stained clay and kaolin. The sand beds commonly contain disseminated kaolin. This deposit which is 100 feet thick and is probably an outwash deposit from the Lower Cretaceous Epoch is found in the northeast and southwest of the study area.\n\nBrandywine gravel consists of ancient alluvial fans sloping gently downward from an altitude of about 300 feet above sea level. This deposit which is about 40 feet thick dates from the Pliocene Epoch is located in the center and south of the study area.\n\nLaurel migmatite is a crystalline rock of an unknown age. It is a composition of intensely granitized schist with impure granite (muscovite and biotite granite) and is located in the northwest and south within the study area.\n\nThe Wicomico formation consists of gravel, sand, and silt and has a thickness of about 30 feet.

        "text": "Physiographic Boundaries and Features\n\nThe study area lies in a transition zone (the \"Fall Line\") between the physiographic provinces of the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont Plateau (map 5). Within the study area there are both river and stream enviornments and urban/ residential tracts. The boundary between the Coastal Plain and Piedmont Plateau is ill defined, marked mainly by the termination of the softer Cretaceous formations and the beginnings of the harder crystalline rocks of the Piedmont Plateau (Vokes 1974: 39). In the stream valleys the softer strata have been eroded, leading to the development of rapids and waterfalls over the crystaline rocks of the Piedmont. The Fall Line, by causing this change in gradient of the Patuxent River, led to the use of water power in Laurel. The Fall Line's most characteristic feature is a change of sea level of 400 feet from the Montgomery County line to city limits of Laurel.\n\nRivers and Streams\n\nThe Patuxent River, forming the northern boundary of the study area, is the longest river lying entirely within the state of Maryland (Corps of Engineers 1975: 5). It drains approximately 2486 square kilometers and is 175 kilometers in length (Steponaitis 1980: 2). The river has an underlying geology which includes formations of laurel migmatite in",

Comus silt loam is a well drained fertile soil occuring on the flood plains and consists of sediments that have been washed from crystaline rocks of the Piedmont Plateau (USDA 1967: 28). Manor loam is a well drained soil that developed from materials weathered from highly micaceous rocks (UDSA 1967: 45).\n\nStreams within the study area, the Walker Branch and Crow Branch, form the western and southern boundaries, respectively. The Walker Branch soils are like those of the river. Banks of the Crow Branch consist of Bibb silt loam which is a deep, level, poorly drained soil (Vokes 1974: 19).\n\nThe river, streams and their banks currently have the potential to support a variety of plants and animals. Plants include: trees, such as oak, yellow-poplar, pines and spruce; and marsh vegetation such as cattail, water millet, river bullrush, spatterdock, and others. Animals may include: fish, raccoon, muskrat, duck and geese (USDA 1967: 155, 157).\n\nLithic resources such as stealtite, quartz, and quartzite deposits are exposed by the downcutting action of the Patuxent River (Steponaitis 1980: 3).\n\nThe river and stream network can be characterized as a system which is both ecologically diverse and rich in resources, surrounding and dissecting the study area.",

The topography of this area is characterized by rolling uplands. The underlying rock formation differs in the west and east of the study area. The western half is underlain by Brandywine gravel, while the eastern half lies over the Patuxent formation. To the east of the $B \\& 0$ railroad the Coastal Plain is underlain by the Wicomico formation.\n\nThere are many different soils within the Coastal Plain in the area of study.

The Beltsville-Urban land complex consists of disturbed land that is composed mainly of Beltsville soils (USDA 1967: 18). These areas have been altered by community development. Beltsville fine sandy loam is a moderately well drained soil that developed from silty to sandy materials deposited by the wind (USDA 1957: 17). Leonardtown silt loam is a poorly drained, nearly level to gently sloping soil found on uplands of the Coastal Plain (USDA 1967: 44). Hyde silt loam consists of poorly drained soils that are dark in color and rich in organic materials that washed from silty or sandy uplands (USDA 1967: 53).\n\nThese soils presently have high potential for the",
