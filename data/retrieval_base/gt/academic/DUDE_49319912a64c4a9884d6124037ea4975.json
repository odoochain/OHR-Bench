It is preserved in the library of the University of Heidelberg, which undertook to digitize it in 2001. This manuscript, in very good condition and easily readable, is a collection of epigrams, short poems for various occasions (real or fictitious). It has exerted a major influence on literature from the Renaissance until today. The Anthology as we know it today results from successive compilations, each time modified, summed up and rearranged by the compilers. It derives ultimately from a collection, entitled The Crown, formed around 100 BC. by the poet Meleager of Gadara.\n\nIn this project, we wish to use digital publishing tools to fill the gaps in current editions and better understand the anthological imaginary. Our pilot project focuses on books IV, V and VII of the PA. Book IV, in spite of its brevity, is particularly interesting because it contains the programmatic presentation of the first compilers, Meleager and Philippe.\n\nOur approach is based on the analogy between the anthological structure as it was conceived in the Hellenistic period, and the characteristics of structuring and circulation of the contents of the web. The PA structure therefore lends itself especially to digital adaptation, in a hypertextual form. Moreover, it seems to us that digital publishing allows us to continue and\n\nA digital platform for rethinking scholarly publishing\n\nEnrico Agostini-Marchese, Elsa Bouchard, Arthur Juchereau, Servanne Monjour, Nicolas Sauret, Marcello Vitali-Rosati\ncomplete the anthological project: the circulation of contents in a digital environment makes it possible to bring out the plurality of perceptions of the textual material as well as the set of links (including weak links) between texts.\n\nTo account for the anthological imaginary does not mean to make a classic critical and genetic edition in which it is necessary to establish a truth of the text but rather to emphasize the innumerable connections between texts. We will therefore carry out a database organized around a text entity, since we consider that a\n\n\nMultilingual translations\n\nTranslations alignements\n\nIntertextual links visualization",
