Storage stability of these alcohols was not determined.\n\nCurrent Method Development Effort (Issue 3) [10]\n\nIssue 3 is an update and improvement of NMAM 1403. Improvements in the method include the use of capillary column chromatography, lower LOD/LOQ values, a new 5 level desorption efficiency (DE) study at lower levels, and a storage stability study at 7,14 , and 30 days.\n\nThe average DE determined for 2-methoxyethanol was $97.8 \\%$ ( $R S D=1.0$ ), for 2-ethoxythanol the DE was $100.2 \\%$ (RSD = 1.2), and for 2-butoxyethanol the DE was $99.9 \\%$ ( $R S D=1.3$ ). The average 30 -day storage stability recovery at approximately $0.5 x$ REL for 2 -methoxyethanol was $103.8 \\%$ ( $R S D=1.4$ ), for 2-ethoxyethanol was 105.0\\% (RSD = 1.6), and for 2-butoxyethanol was 82.6\\% (RSD = 1.4).\n\nThe precision and accuracy information listed in Table 2 was calculated by using the data from generated air samples [7, 8] and the analytical data from the current update [10].",
