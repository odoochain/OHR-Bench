        "text": "DANGERS OF THE BIODIVERSITY TREATY \\\\ a Summary of the Unconvevional Contention\n\n\nAlthough its importance has been kept exceedingly quiet. The (onvention on Biological Diversity is the most sweeping treaty ever to be proposed in American history. calling for an unprecedented intrusion of govermment into the economic and social fabric of America and other nations. No other treaty in American history has proposed to so interfere with human interactions or the internal alfairs of nations. The treaty provides its signers with potential to employ the treaty's provisions and language in social and cultural engineering. intervention in cultural and social development, and the promotion or retardation of current social lifestyles. The Convention calls on countries to inventory and data base not only biological information (National Biological Survey). but also information having more to do with social, cultural and coonomic structure than with biodisersity.\n\n\nThis treaty promises to be the source of more litigation than all other treaties combined. The goals of the Convention are:\n1) to preserve maximum biological diversity in the unsupported belief that in doing so provides substantial bencfits. Because no two deer, trout or blades of grass are exactly identical. eversthing on earth will require government protection:\n2) to control the nature and extent of natural and human resources within cosystems. Since the Convention treats human activity as the principle threat to biodiversity, human ativity must be tightly controlled and directed. Furthermore, the Convention demands these actions oceur even without \"scientific certainty,\"\n3) to ensure that others (\"developing countries\" reeciving preferential treatment) obtain a fair and equitable share of the products of research and development carried out by other individuals and businesses. Signers of the Convention are encouraged to alter patent laws to allow for this \"sharing\" or redistribution of technology:\n4) to transfer the production of goods and technologies that van in any manner be related to biodiversity, including machinery, computer technology and possible even military techmology. The treaty makes no mention of personal property rights.\n\nThe vague twenty-odd page treaty will be enfored by implementation protovol based on a three thousand page United Nations document entitled the Clobal Biodiversity Assessment (GBA). Yet. when the Senate requested copies, the United Nations refused to acknowledge the document eren existed. Copies of the GBA do exist, however. and it permits governmental control of any activity or thing which could conveivably have an impact on biodiversity: Because terms such as \"biodiversity\" and \"sustainable use\" are exceedingly broad and vague, this demand permits federal control of everything and every activity.\n\nThe Bush administration rejected the treaty becatuse of its financial implications on Ameriva. They also rejected the treaty because it was clear the treaty would retard the development of new technology to meet future needs \"by providing inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, and implying that biotechology development is unsafe.\" To obtain ratification of the Convention under the Clinton administration. Senator Pell and the State Department have offered the American public reservations to protect the interests of this nation. .irtiele 37 of the Convention, however, specifically states that \"|n|o reservations may be made to this treaty.\"\n\nIf this treaty is ratified the treaty will:\n1. Weaken the sovereignty of the United States. I nless Congress specifically states otherwise. The courts will assume that Congress has ratified the treaty with good faith intent to lite up to the letter and spirit of the document. Vumerous judicial decisions hate made it abundantly clear that the courts will. wherever possible, seek to harmonize later Avis of Congress with prior passed treaties unless Congress has elearly indicated othemvise. The history of court decisions also makes it elear that the treaty. will replace inconsistent existing federal laws.",

        "text": "2. Give Federal agencies powers that they would not have in the absence of the Convention. Environmental groups as well as the Env irommental Protection Ageney and other agencies make it olear that they intend to treat the Convention as a self-executing treaty (meaning that Congress needs to take no further action to implement all the provisions of the treaty other than ratitication). Agencies and the Administration are justifying this self-executing without ('ongressiomal appoval by interpretating from the treaty language such as \"take legislative, administrative. and policy measures.\" If Congress lcaves such language without specific stated checks and limitations, federal agencies will be able to expand their regulatory powers over land use and environmental regulations without limit.\n3. Provide for the adoption of protocols, amexes and amendments without Congressional authorization because of the treaty's intentional vagueness. The treaty only allows the Inited States with one vote in decision making, and no veto power or other protection against unreasonable or overtearing action made by the Conference of the Parties. The only mechanism by which the Inited States can object to an action under the treaty is to withdraw from the entire treaty. Oherwise we are legally bound to the treaty's provisions and protocols. This is semething we should not do lightly one ratification has occurred. Withdrawal cannot occur for a period of two years after the treaty is ratified. After this two year period has passed. withdrawal takes a minimum of one ycar.\n4. Relegate people and their interests to a secondary place compared with animals and plants. Because the Convention places the interests of people to a secondary level to nature, the Convention may allow government to ignore or overrule the protection giten to indi iduals under the Constitution.\n5. Csurp state and local land use and envirommental regulatory power. Federal treaty powers in combination with the courts broad internetation of the Commeree Clause give the federal government broad regulatory powers nornally reserved for state and local government. This is especially true in light of statutes such as the ESA and Clean Water. At. Furthemere. if the Contention is implemented as a selfexecuting treaty, then the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution will render all inconsistent laws including each and every state and local land use and environmental regulation - null and void. Environmental groups have made it elear that they will litigate under the Idministrative Procedure Aet, NEPA and the citizen suit provisions of the ESA and Clean Water. mineral, wildife and \\%oning questions inevitably federal questions based en a clain of preemption. These groups will hat catherity to do hlis beeatse the courts ant mandated to enforee treaties in litigation of private rights which are brought about by citizen suit provisions.\n\nIf ratified, the treaty will require broad expansion of current regulations. At this time there are no laws requiring protection of entire coosystems or restoration of human-impacted coosystems. There are no laws requiring control or eradication of alien species or engaging in determining what cultures. cultural practices. lifestyles and traditions should be encouraged and which should be abolished. There are no laws that contemplate the sistematic and wholesale transference of technologe and existing properts of the fruit of research and development from the hands of those who own that telunology. property and research to those whe do not. Ratilication of this treaty will require the rewriting of America's legal spstem.\n\nThe Biodiversity convention is the eomerstone of future envirommental litigation and kegislation. Without ratification of this treaty. environmentalists will be unable to obtain many of the changes to the Fndangered Species Aet and Clean Water Let which they desire. but camot justify in an open delate. Without ratification of the treaty. many of the actions taken by federal agencies in recent years may be proven unconstitutional.\n\n\nThis surmary is based on the \"Technizal Consderations of the Einven' on or Bologcai Liversaty-The Unconventonal Conventon\" by Mark Polot and pubished by the Wational Wilderness irsticute Nir.

        "text": "THANKS TO YOUR HELP WE STOPPED THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY FROM Even coming to the Senate floor for a vote! Your phone calls made the differ ence ! Three things happened that kept Senate majority Leader Mitchell from BRINGING THE TREATY TO THE FLOOR FOR VOTING:\n1. The fax alert that was sent out on Wednesday night, September 28, and YOUR SUBSEQUENT PHONE-IN EFFORTS LITERALLY TIED UP MOST SENATORS PHONES through Monday, October 3RD.\n2. The American Sheep industry covertly got a copy of Section 10 of the United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment (GBA) on Thursday, SEPTEMBER 29. The GBA is to be used as the basis to write the treaty PROTOCOL THIS NOVEMBER. THE PROTOCOL WILL PROVIDE THE REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS FOR THE VAGUELY WRITTEN TWENTY PAGE TREATY.\n\nThe GBA has twelve sections. Section 10 alone is nearly 300 pages of text OUTLINING A TOTAL REORGANIZATION OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION AROUND NATURE WITHiN bioregions. Property rights and other civil rights would be limited to ONLY THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT DO NO HARM TO BIODIVERSITY AS DETERMINED BY bioregional councils directed by NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations, I.E. Environment al groups)\n\nTHE BASIS FOR PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY WAS TO BE CENTERED ON WHAT IS KNOWN as the Wildlands Project which calls for setting aside vast areas (ABOUT 50\\%) OF AMERICA INTO RESERVE WILDERNESS AREAS, INTERCONNECTING CORRIDORS, AND HUMAN BUFFER ZONES WHERE HUMAN USE WOULD BE ELIMINATED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED. (Details in the Sept. 25,1993 edition of Science Magazine)\n\nUntil Friday, September 30 the United Nations continued to deny the Global Biodiversity Assessment Document even existed!\n3. THE MAINE CONSERVATION RIGHTS INSTITUTE HAD ALREADY MADE HIGH QUALITY COLORED MAPS OF WHAT THESE RESERVES AND CORRIDORS WOULD LOOK LIKE IN different parts of America and, along with Section 10 of the GBA, FedEXED THEM TO THE SENATE. FOUR BY SIX FOOT POStERS OF THE MAPS AND KEY TEXT FROM GBA SECTION 10 WERE TAKEN TO THE SENATE FLOOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON OF september 30. They had a devastating effect. Senator Mitchell withdrew HIS INTENT TO PETITION TO CLOTURE THE TREATY, AND NEVER AGAIN BROUGHT IT UP THROUGH THE TIME THE SENATE ADJOURNED ON OCTOBER 8.\n\nSECTION 10 OF the GBA and the maps proved that we were right in our claims that the treaty would have a devastating effect on America, and the Senate WOULD HAVE BEEN RATIFYING A BLANK CHECK FOR RADICAL CHANGES.\n\nTHANKS AGAIN! WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU!\n\nBut let's stay on our toes. This will be introduced next year with the same GOAL, BUT WITH WATERED DOWN LANGUAGE TO APPEAL TO AN UNINFORMED SENATE.\n\nFor Further information Call Mihe Collman (207) 9.15-9878",
