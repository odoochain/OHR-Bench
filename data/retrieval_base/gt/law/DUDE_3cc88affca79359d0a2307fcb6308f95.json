That is wrong. Save for minor procedural requirements, the State let the case remain stayed and did not pursue discovery. Only dfer FirstEnergy admitted its culpability in the underying HB. 6 scandal, revealing a provable new aspect of the bribery scandal involing the former Chair of the PYCO, did the State seek to lift the stay to add new parties and new clams. Amending of the Complain was precisely justifed based on the change in landscape that was argued in the State's onginal Motion.

FirstEnergy's DPA and the advancing of other civil cases are just such cimamstances.\n\nIt is oversimplifed for the Responding Defendants to argue that the State agreed to the stay in \"exchange for disconthuation of decouphng charges\". (Firstenergy Memo Contra, pg. 4.) It is trae that once the decouplang charges ended, the State sam no basis for the case to advance further at that the, based largely upon this Cour's earler discovery orders based on the pending prosecution.
