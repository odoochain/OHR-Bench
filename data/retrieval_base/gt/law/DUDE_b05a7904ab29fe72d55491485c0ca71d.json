        "text": "These are the dates that Cook County State Attorney's office, Phoenix Police Department, Dolton Police Department, Echo Joint agreement, Pace Elementary, and Iris Martinez Cook County Clerk violated FOIA request. I'm still going through childhood trauma from being wrongfully accused of sexual assault. Every time my mother went to the Phoenix Police Department, she was told that it's not records of me being wrongfully accused of sexually assault at Pace Elementary. Phoenix Police is committing corruption by covering up the records containing me being accused and arrested for criminal sexually assault. If someone could be charged with sexually assault and it's no time frame. It shouldn't be a time frame for the person that wrongfully accuses you from being charged. This has ruined my relationship with my family and friends. That's bias for the wrongfully accused not to receive equal Justice. I'm willing to take this matter to The United States Supreme Court to fix this issue. I believe that this is a major flaw in our Justice system that would prevent others from suffering as others and myself have suffered. Situations like this causes a lifetime of emotional distress, mental anguish, and pain and suffering. I live with this pain every day. For these government entities listed above to constantly tell me it's no documents of me being charged with rape is an insult. I was 14 years old. I cry tears from the pain of being labeled a rapist.\n\nOn June 25, 2021, Illinois attorney general said that Phoenix police violated the requirements of FOIA by failing to respond to a FOIA request submitted by me Shedrick Bowes-Northern.\n\nOn February 6, 2021, I submitted a FOIA request to the Phoenix police Department seeking copies of all records concerning case number 99JD18369.\n\nOn February 17, 2021, I submitted the above-referenced Request for Review to The Illinois Attorney general alleging that the Department had failed to respond to my request.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, the Illinois Attorney general sent a copy of the Request for Review to the Phoenix Police Department and asked whether it had responded to the request; if they had not yet responded to the request, The Illinois Attorney general asked the Phoenix Police Department to respond to my request and send a copy their office. A Department representative informed the AAG that the Village Clerk, Ms. Melba Ferrell, would have been responsible for my request. the AAG left a voice message for Ms. Ferrell and sent her an e-mail attaching copies of FOIA request letter\n\nOn March 05, 2021, Cook County State Attorney office FOIA officer JEANEANE BOOKER emailed me a letter stating that The Cook County State Attorney personnel who are most knowledgeable about the existence of any records responsive to my request, has been no responsive records based on the information you provided in your FOIA request.

The Village of Phoenix has no records that the arresting officer worked for Phoenix Police Department at that time, or that the arrest was in Phoenix. Mr. Bowes emailed what he had to me, and I explained to him that our Police department had no records on this matter.

A Pace Elementary student, Patricia Alexander, said I raped her with a knife to her neck for an hour in Pace Elementary school restroom. Located at E 155th St \\& 7th Ave, Phoenix, IL 60426, attached to Coolidge middle school at the time. The Dolton police department picked me up from my job at The Dolton Expo center located in Dolton. Dolton police department said that Phoenix police wanted to talk to me. Dolton police transferred me to the Phoenix police department without notifying my parents.\n\nWhen I arrived at the Phoenix police department, I asked one of the Phoenix Police department officers in lockup to call my parents. The Phoenix police officer told me that I couldn't make any calls to the detective to come in to interview me. When I asked the officer what I was being arrested for, he told me that I'd find all that out when the detective comes in. I was placed in a Phoenix police department holding Jail cell without food or communication with my parents. I asked the Phoenix police department officer if he could call my mother to know where I am and worry about not coming home. He refused to contact her-me being 14, not knowing what was going on or why I was being arrested. I started getting nervous and worrying about my mother, now knowing what was going on with me. I started crying. The officer said, don't cry now. You weren't crying when you did what you did. I was confused because I didn't do anything.\n\nThe detective interviewed me without my parents being present and charged me with AGGRAVATED CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT. The Phoenix police officer watching me kept saying, you did it. You know you did it and kept joking about the alleged rape, saying, you going to the shit house, referring to Cook County Juvenile Detention Center. The detective told the officer that since I'm a minor, I couldn't be in a jail cell, that he had to handcuff me to a chair. I asked the detective could he call my mother; Phoenix police officers told me that I could call my mother when I get to the shit house. The Phoenix police officer repeatedly asked me why I take Patricia Alexander's pussy and why I keep lying about taking it.\n\nSaying you know you took the pussy, that's why you are going to the shit house. Referring to the Cook County Juvenile correction center. Laughing and joking with other Phoenix police department officers. Phoenix police department transported me to Cook County Juvenile Detention Center.\n\nCook County Juvenile Center staff allowed me to call my mother and stepfather, Marvin Mcferren. I told my mother that I was charged with rape. She started crying, saying that they got the wrong one. My mother knew I wasn't even sexually active at the age of 14.\n\nMy stepfather got on the phone and told me to put somebody who works there and then ask me why I haven't called them. I explained to him that the Phoenix police officer wouldn't let me. I started crying, hearing my mother crying in the background. I asked one of the ladies Cook County Juvenile detention center staff members could she get on the phone. She said that my time was up, and she doesn't have any information about anything going on with me. Then she said that I'd be able to make a call when I get upstairs. I was giving a red shirt and some pants. I",

While I was in there, I was humiliated, verbally abused, physically abused, emotionally abused, and spiritually abused. Other Cook County Juvenile inmates constantly picked on me, calling me a rapist. I remember one of the staff members name officer Martinez.\n\nMy mother and grandmother coming to see me there was embarrassing. The only good thing I got out of the Cook County Juvenile center was learning the Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us today the food we need, and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sin against us. And don't let us yield to temptation but rescue us from the evil one.\n\nMy mother frequently went to the Phoenix police department and Markham courthouse. They told her year after year that the case didn't exist since I was found not guilty. I grew up with my family abandoning me, beating me, emotionally abusing me, and being humiliated after I was released. I felt like my life had ended from Patricia Alexander lying, saying I raped her with a knife to her throat for an hour at Pace Elementary school. The school restroom she was referring to is right next to the main office. All these defendants left Patricia Alexander, Phoenix police department, Pace elementary school, Cook County state attorney, and Illinois State Board of education. Left a wound in my heart that would be there forever. I forgive her. Not cause of what she did, but because of the power and strength that God gave me to forgive.\n\nEcho Joint Agreement program, Cook County State attorney office, Phoenix Police department, Iris Martinez Cook County Circuit Clerk, and Dolton police all have received FOIA request that they haven't answered. I'm going to take this case to the United States Supreme Court. Rape case wrongfully accused victims shouldn't be punished and nothing is done when we are found not guilty to the real criminals that falsely accused us.\n\nI demand compensatory damages and punitive damages for the pain and suffering, humiliation, embarrassment, fear, emotional trauma, emotional distress, mental anguish, disfigurement, the deprivation of my constitutional rights and dignity, interference with everyday life, and whatever additional relief this Court deems equitable and just.",
