The record should reflect the defendant is present in person, good morning, with his attorney, Peter Kelly. The state's attorney Michael Powell is present, Cochise County Attorney's Office.\n\nThis is the time set for trial in this matter, but we have a few items, I think, that we need to take up in advance of trial. I have turned on the Meet Me line for purposes of permitting the presence of members of the First Amendment Clinic Public Interest Law Firm, attorneys for interveners David Morgan and Terri Jo Neff to appear, should they call in.\n\nWe have a motion to intervene filed by that law firm, a response filed by this Cochise county Attorney's office, and a reply to that motion filed by the Public Interest Law Firm as well.\n\nAnd I don't know if anyone is present from the Sandra Day O'Connor First Amendment Clinic. I have read and reviewed their motion to intervene.\n\nMr. Powell, do you want to be heard in response to that motion?",

POWELL: Then I would prefer not to make an oral record since they haven't received notice and ask the court to rule.\n\nTHE COURT: Thank you. I reviewed the response filed by the State.\n\nMr. Kelly, do you have any response that you filed or take any position with respect to the motion to intervene for the limited purposes of ensuring attendance at juror and imposing secrecy regarding jurors, do you take any position with regard to that motion?\n\nMR. KELLY: I have a question before I --\nI have not had time to read that, but $I$ am just curious overall, but what sort of rights they would get by intervening?\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. So, you are not taking any position?\n\nMR. KELLY: I am opposing it, but I would like to get a brief synopsis of what rights they would gain.\n\nTHE COURT: What's requested specifically",

We want to make a fuller record of this. Jeff, $I$ am going to ask you to go ask stephanie to place a call to this outfit to see if they want to make an appearance.\n\nMR. KELLY: I have no position, Your\n\nHonor.\nTHE COURT: The Meet Me line is open. Those are the specific requests that they are -- that they enumerated in their motion which have been addressed by the state.\n\nIn addition to that motion, there was a\nmotion filed by Mr. Morgan to stay the trial\nproceedings.

This is an in-custody defendant who, as the court knows, this case has been going on for quite some time, and now David Morgan wants to continue the trial so he can go fight a battle at the court of Appeals on it.\n\nSo, the State does not believe that it's in the interest of justice. It does tie back in to the request for cameras, and $I$ request that we make a record on.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMR. POWELL: And if the Court wants me to do that now or --\n\nTHE COURT: GO ahead.\nMR. POWELI: Okay. So, I know that we\nreceived late last week a motion from Mr. Morgan to have cameras in the courtroom so that he can be recording the proceedings. Rule 122 of the Rules of Supreme Court controls and --\n\nTHE BAILIFE: No answer.\nTHE COURT: The record should reflect that the First Amendment Law Firm was contacted to call in today.

So, the request must be made under certain provisions according to Rule 122, and the Court, under Rule $122(D)$, may deny or limit the request. And the court may, on their own or upon objection, deny such a request after making specific on the record findings that are outlined in 122 (D) (1).\n\nI know that, given the very short\ntimeframe that Mr. Morgan filed his motion, there wasn't really time for either side to file written responses. I know that the court, through the judicial assistant, sent an email inquiring as to the state and defense's position.\n\nI know that both the State and defense object, and I did file follow-up this weekend, just to put that in writing.\n\nHowever, the more specific objection that the State would be making here is really, a lot of these issues under (D) (1) (a), impact coverage upon right of any party to appear, fair hearing or trial, and then likelihood coverage would distract participants, coverage would disrupt or distract from the dignity of the proceeding.",

I know that the Court is familiar with the circumstance of that where there was a promise, just like there was in this request from Mr. Morgan, not to show any of the jurors.\n\nAnd that request was not -- that order was not followed. He did show the jurors. He published the images of the jurors during the trial, and as a result, that caused us to have to do that trial a second time, and that resulted in a minor victim having to testify twice about being sexually assaulted.\n\nSo, the State believes that, particularly\nMr. Morgan has demonstrated, that he is unable to follow that order, despite his claim of doing so.\n\nI would also note, and this ties in to the other motion, there is a concern that the press will not be press available or able to be present in the courtroom. It's $8: 41$ this morning, no one is here. So, they have the opportunity, and they are waiving that opportunity.\n\nBut the courtroom is open in this case.

This is an instance where the press and the defendant have somewhat competing interests.\n\nSo, the State does believe that the court should make an on the record finding that coverage of this case, as requested, would impact the ability that the Court hold a fair hearing of the trial for both sides, and coverage would distract and disrupt the dignity of the proceedings.\nthe Court: Okay.

The third request made by the interveners that the names of jurors be disclosed at the conclusion of the trial is therefore denied.\n\nFinally, request No. 4 that the Court not promise jurors that their name will be held confidential at the conclusion of the trial is a different sort of a request, and it is consistent with prior practices of the court in my experience which is to inform prospective jurors that in the event that the press wishes to interview them, they may approach the jurors individually.\n\nIt will be entirely within the discretion of the individual juror to speak with the press or not speak with the press to disclose their names, if they wish to or not.",
