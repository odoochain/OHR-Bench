        "text": "ARTICLE 4\n\n\nQUALITY AND PRESSURE SPECIFICATIONS\n4.1 Quality Specifications. Transporter reserves the right to reject any and all shipments of: (i) Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper to Transporter whose gravity, viscosity, and/or other characteristics are such that it is not readily susceptible to transportation through the Transporter's existing facilities and it will damage the quality of other shipments or cause disadvantage to other shippers and/or the Transporter; (ii) Crude Petroleum containing water, sediment and other impurities totaling in excess of one per cent as determined by centrifugal test, or by such other tests as may be agreed upon by the Shipper and Transporter; or (iii) Crude Petroleum where Shipper has failed to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations made by any governmental authorities regarding shipment of Crude Petroleum.\n4.2 Contaminants. Transporter has the right, at its discretion, to reject crude oil containing contaminants. If Transporter determines that a Shipper has delivered to Transporter's facilities Crude Petroleum that has been contaminated by the existence of and or excess amounts of impure substances, including but not limited to chlorinated and/or oxygenated hydrocarbons, arsenic, lead and/or other metals which results in harm to other shippers, Downstream Pipelines, users of the contaminated Crude Petroleum or Transporter, such Shipper will be excluded from further entry into applicable segments of the pipeline system until such time as the quality of the Crude Petroleum is to the satisfaction of the Transporter. Transporter is not responsible for monitoring receipts or deliveries for contaminants. Further, Transporter reserves the right to dispose of any contaminated Crude Petroleum blocking its pipeline system. Disposal thereof may be made in any reasonable manner including but not limited to commercial sales, and any liability associated with the contamination or disposal of any Crude Petroleum shall be borne by the Shipper introducing the contaminated Crude Petroleum into Transporter's system. Shipper liability includes, but is not limited to, claims from other shippers, carriers, or users of the contaminated Crude Petroleum and the costs of any regulatory or judicial proceeding.\n4.3 Periodic Samples. Transporter reserves the right to periodically sample and test the quality of the Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper at any Receipt Point. Transporter shall be responsible for all costs attributable to such periodic sampling and testing. If at any time Shipper's Crude Petroleum triggers any of the rejection rights set forth in Section 4.1, Shipper shall pay for any tests performed thereafter to establish that such Crude Petroleum no longer triggers such provisions.\n4.4 Pressure. The present maximum operating pressure at all reception points is 1440 psig . Shipper's injection pressure shall be maintained within this stated maximum limit and shall conform, as near as possible, to the hydraulic gradient. Transporter reserves the right to reduce the maximum operating pressure by written notice to Shipper. Shipper shall furnish, or cause the producer from which Crude Petroleum is purchased to furnish, install, calibrate, and maintain continuous pressure recording devices at or near injection points to monitor pipeline operating pressures. Copies of the recording charts taken from these recording devices shall be furnished to Transporter on a weekly basis by Shipper. Shipper shall also furnish Transporter copies of annual calibration certificates for recording devices. Transporter reserves the right to witness calibration of these devices, and Shipper shall notify Transporter at least 48 hours prior to the initiation of such calibration procedures. Circumstances may arise which in Transporter's judgment require the Gathering System, or any part thereof, be shut down. Following such shutdown periods, Shippers shall obtain authorization from Transporter prior to the resumption of injections.",

If during any monthly accounting period, the weighted average of the BS\\&W on all meter tickets covering Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter by Shipper reflects a water, sediment and other impurities content which exceeds $1 \\%$, Shipper shall pay to Transporter a handling charge as specified in the table in Exhibit A on such excess water, sediment, and other impurities to cover the treating, separation and other aspects of handling such excess water, sediment and other impurities delivered to Transporter. This explicitly excludes disposal. Transporter shall accept excess water for handling only when Shipper has made the necessary arrangements for disposal of such excess water. Shipper may dispose of its excess water by method acceptable to Transporter such as barging or trucking subject to a mutually agreed upon schedule for excess water removal by Shipper from Transporter's Grand Isle tankage. As an alternative, Shipper may request Transporter to dispose of Shipper's excess water by use of Transporter's onshore disposal wells. The fees for disposal are set forth in Exhibit A. In any event, Shipper must contact Transporter in advance at 713-351-3000 to schedule means by which BS\\&W will be disposed. Where no meter tickets are available or meter tickets are in Transporter's opinion unreliable, water, sediment and other impurities in the system in excess of that reported on acceptable meter tickets will be allocated in a fair and equitable manner by Transporter. Notwithstanding the fact that Transporter levies a handling charge covering excess water, sediment and other impurities content in a Crude Petroleum stream, Transporter reserves the right to reject any nomination of products other than Crude Petroleum which satisfies all quality standards, requirements and conditions set forth herein.\n\n\nARTICLE 5 \\\\ OFFSHORE PLATFORM FACILITIES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n5.1 Transporter or its authorized representative shall have access to the platform from which shipments are received for the purpose of examining and checking meters and other installations utilized in connection with the handling of Crude Petroleum injected into the pipeline.\n5.2 Shipper, upon request by Transporter, shall install, maintain and operate, or make arrangements with platform owners to install, maintain, and operate equipment to inject corrosion inhibitors, biocides, scale inhibitors, paraffin chemicals, or other chemicals as specified by Transporter.\n5.3 Shipper shall provide or arrange with platform operator to furnish, operate, and maintain such pumping equipment as is necessary to inject the Crude Petroleum nominated by Shipper for shipment or will cause same to be done. Pumping equipment shall be controlled and operated so that the hourly rate at which Crude Petroleum is injected during each month shall not exceed $120 \\%$ of the average hourly volume nominated and accepted for shipment during the current calendar month. If piston pumps are used, surge absorbers shall be installed, upon reasonable request of Transporter, to minimize pulsation. Transporter reserves the right, upon written notification to all Shippers to further limit the variation of Shipper's injection rates, if in Transporter's judgment proration is imminent. Reasonable exceptions to variations of injection rates for Shippers with newly discovered, expended production, and unusual production difficulties will be allowed by Transporter.",

Transporter reserves the right to require Shipper to install or cause platform owners to install in accordance with applicable API and ASTM (American Society for Testing Materials) standards metering and meter proving equipment capable of continuous custody measurement, and devices for continuous proportional to-flow sampling of the Crude Petroleum.\n5.6 If Crude Petroleum to be delivered to Transporter is produced at some distance from the Transporter's facilities and Transporter does not elect to provide a connection directly to the production platform where it is produced, Shipper may furnish, or cause to be furnished, free of cost to Transporter, the connecting pipeline required to deliver such Shipper's Crude Petroleum to the location designated by Transporter. If such location is on another producer's platform, all arrangement for installing the connecting pipeline or other required equipment or facilities on such platform shall be the sole responsibility of the Shipper.\n5.7 At Transporter's request, Shipper will allow, or cause the platform owner(s) to allow, Transporter to place, operate, repair and maintain riser piping, scraper traps, valves, surveillance equipment, and any other equipment deemed by Transporter to be needed for the safe and efficient operation of the Gathering System. In the event Transporter should decide to transmit meter readings or other data from the platform from which Shipper's Crude Petroleum is run, Shipper will allow, or cause the platform owner(s) to allow, reasonable access to and use of communication facilities which may be available at the platform.\n5.8 Where meter readings are available Transporter will prepare, as near as practicable to 7:00 a.m. on the first day of each month, a monthly pipeline run ticket for Shipper showing opening and closing meter readings and water, sediment, other impurities percentage on the basis of which Crude Petroleum and water, sediment, and other impurities volumes will be determined. If for any reason Transporter's representative fails to reach any receipt point on the first day of the month, Shipper's own representative, with prior authorization from Transporter, will obtain and make a record for Transporter's representative of the closing meter reading and will withdraw the sample material from the sampling equipment. The sample material thus withdrawn will be sealed in a special container and retained by Shipper's representative for Transporter's representative who will, during his next trip to that receipt point, determine the water, sediment, and other impurities percentage of the sample material in the special container and prepare the monthly pipeline run ticket. Where no meter readings are available, Crude Petroleum including water, sediment and other impurities will be determined by Transporter from the best available data.",

If such total fluids (Crude Petroleum plus unspent acid) is not so neutralized, the Gathering System may have to be shut down which in turn will require all connected producers to shut in their wells. To assist Transporter to anticipate the need and to prepare for possible corrective actions which may be required to void or minimize operating difficulties caused by any unneutralized acid, Shippers shall furnish, or cause the producer from which Crude Petroleum is purchased to furnish to Transporter, the following information at least 24 hours in advance of start of production from any well which has been acidized: (i) estimated time of first production from acidized well; (ii) estimated time that first production from acidized well, which has been neutralized to a pH equal to or greater than 4.5 , will be injected into the Gathering System; and (iii) estimated time that produced fluids from previously acidized wells, which has been neutralized to a pH equal to or greater than 4.5 , will be free of neutralized acids. Shipper shall assume full responsibility for and reimburse Transporter for all extra costs and expenses incurred by Transporter as the result of any unspent and/or unneutralized acids being present in the Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter by Shipper. Shipper will be billed for all such extra costs and expenses for shutting down, purging of such unspent acids, and subsequent resuming operation of the Transporter's Gathering System. Transporter shall not be liable to any Shipper for any damage sustained by Shipper(s) as the result of unspent and/or unneutralized acids being received from other Shipper(s).\n5.10 In the event that Shipper does not operate the wells from which the Crude Petroleum nominated for shipment is produced or does not operate the treating, measurement, or pumping equipment through which such Crude Petroleum is handled prior to its delivery to Transporter, then Shipper shall designate the party or parties responsible for the operation of such facilities and shall authorize and direct such party or parties to (1) comply with all provisions of this Agreement related to their operations and (2) furnish to Transporter such reasonably requested operational, technical, administrative, and analytical data as Transporter deems necessary to account for volumes being delivered to Transporter and assure safe, lawful, and efficient operations.\n\nARTICLE 6\nGRAVITY BANK\n6.1 To assure that no shipper will be materially damaged or allowed to benefit by changes in gravity due to the intermixing of petroleum in the Gathering System, Shipper will be required, as a condition of tendering, to participate in a Gravity Bank.

Applicable barrels and gravities shall be the net barrels at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (with no deduction for Loss allowance) and the gravities recorded by the Operator at points where it customarily records gravities and quantities. The weighted average gravity differential value per barrel (for two or more gravities of petroleum), as hereinafter referred to, shall be obtained in the following manner: multiply the gravity differential values per barrel (from the attached table as same is from time to time revised) by the number of barrels to which such gravity differential values are applicable and then divide the total of the resultant gravity differential values in dollars and cents by the total of the applicable barrels.\n6.3 Adjustments between shippers shall be computed as follows: (i) compute the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the barrels received from by each shipper and (ii) compute the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the composite common stream for receipts.\n\n\n6.4 Calculation:\n\n(a) If the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of a shipper as so determined under Section 6.3(i) above shall be greater than the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the aforementioned common stream petroleum as determined under Section 6.3(ii), the difference in cents per barrel shall be calculated and shipper shall be credited (receives) an amount calculated by multiplying said difference in gravity differential value per barrel by the applicable barrels.\n(b) If the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of a shipper is less than the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the aforementioned common stream petroleum, the difference shall be calculated as above outlined and a shipper debited for such difference.\n(c) A sample calculation is attached as Exhibit C.\n6.5 These calculations shall be made for each calendar month and the algebraic sum of the adjustments for the system shall be zero $+/-$ One Dollar. If a shipper shall have a net debit balance in combining the two adjustments made above, the balance shall be remitted to the clearinghouse within fifteen (15) days from receipt of statement of such debit. If Shipper shall have a credit, the clearinghouse shall remit the amount thereof after receipt by the clearinghouse of the sums from those shippers having debits as calculated above.\n\nARTICLE 7\n\nMEASUREMENT AND TESTING\n7.1 Crude Petroleum tendered to Transporter for transportation shall be measured and tested by a representative of Transporter prior to its receipt from Shipper. Shipper shall have the privilege of being present or represented at the measurement and testing. Quantities shall be measured by meters and calculated in accordance with applicable A.P.I. Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards. All shipments of required specifications will be received and delivered as net standard volume, as the total volume excluding water, sediment and other impurities, corrected by the appropriate volume correction factor for the observed temperature and A.P.I. gravity, relative density, or density to a standard temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and also corrected by the applicable pressure correction factor and meter factor. Where measurement and testing of shipments to determine water, sediment, and other impurities content is not performed, the Transporter shall determine the water, sediment, and other impurities content of shipments based on the best available data. Due to the complexity of the allocations of the non-metered receipt locations, any prior period volume adjustment of 500 barrels or less will be corrected by including the corrected prior Months' (positive or negative) volume in the current month allocation process. Any shipper request for volume or quality adjustments prior to the most previous twenty-four (24) Month time frame will not be considered.",

As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within one year and one day after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within one year and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within two years and one day from the date of delivery, or within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed.

The Party affected by the Force Majeure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the Force Majeure condition with all reasonable dispatch, shall give written notice to the other Party of the termination of the Force Majeure, and shall resume performance of any suspended obligation promptly after termination of such Force Majeure; provided, that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a Party may elect, in its sole discretion, whether or not to repair or replace its facilities following catastrophic destruction of all or substantially all of such facilities.",
