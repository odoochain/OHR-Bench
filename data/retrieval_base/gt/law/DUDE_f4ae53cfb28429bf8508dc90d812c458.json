USPAP is issued by the Appraisal Standards Sourd of The Appraisal Foundation. This Board is authorized by Congress as the Source of Appraisal Standards and Appraiser Qualifications.\n1. What types of intangible property are valued by the appraiser in a fair\nmarket value appraisal?\n\nThere are three types of property included in such an appraisal. They are real property (real estate), tangible personal property (TPP) such as pipes and pumping stations, etc., and intangible property-- which includes but is not limited to:\na. Non-physical assets\nb. Franchises\nc. Trademarks\nd. Patents\ne. Goodwill\nf. Equities\ng. Securities\nh. Contracts and contract rights\ni. Certificated or established service areas\nj. Permits\nk. Management procedures and practices\nl. Exclusive easements (performed separately with real property)\nm . Engineering studies and technical determinations as well as planning and design for facilities not constructed\nn. Time and cost of building the business\no. Establishment of standard operating procedures (SOP's), routes, and maintenance/renewal/replacement programs\np. Customer lists, customer data, billing, and related financial accounting\nq. Water allocations or rights",

        "text": "In addition to the above there are other non-physical property values.\n\n2. What are the typical utility appraisal methods for determining intangible value for a water and sewer system?\n\nTypically, a cost assessment for the applicable intangible items is accomplished and the amounts are totaled for the opinion. In other words, the 17 items above, and any others which may apply, are individually valued and totaled. The intangible values apply only with the cost approach and do not apply to the income or comparable sales approaches.\n\nA second method, which takes less time, is to adopt a percentage and apply it to the cost approach as the additional value of a live plant versus a dead plant or a going concern factor. This second method is in lieu of the first method and can be compared to the first method for reasonableness. There is confusion when using the term \"going concern\" as to which context the term applies. \"Going Concern\" in terms of appraisal practice has been taken as the total enterprise, i.e. all tangible and intangible assets including business value (as stated in The Appraisal of Real Estate-Appraisal Institute various editions). In contrast, case law decisions, typical industry and banking practices treat going concern as an increment of value or a separate item, distinct from the reproduction or replacement cost of the real tangible and tangible personal property. Therefore the going concern component is added to the cost approach result in order to achieve full fair market value of the subject system. Again when either of the other two approaches is used (comparable sales or income), this component of value is already included and is not added to the result. The going concern amount is considered a part of the fair market value, in excess of the value of the physical plant (TPP) and real estate property, because the whole assembled system would be considered by a reasonable buyer and seller in setting a purchase price (see General Telephone Co. of Illinois, 29 P.U.R. 3d 369 III. Ct. Cl. 1959).\n\nEach of the intangible items require careful consideration of the evaluator/appraiser and may require sub-consultants in the areas of utility engineering, management, ownership, financial, utility legal costs, regulatory rights/benefits/costs as well as specific experience in the field with prior transactions as a utility appraiser.\n\nFor either method of quantifying going concern or a cost assessment for assembly the work is not necessarily a precise calculation and involves opinion, estimates, and experience. Some cases have found that this necessary portion of value is difficult and perhaps an arbitrary task (see Appleton Water Works Co. v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin (now the Wisconsin Public Service Commission), 154 Wis. 121, 142 N.W. 476 1913).",

        "text": "Historically Public Service Commissions, in the fair market value era, regularly valued the going concern component to fair market value as an added percentage or factor applied to the cost approach result of the tangible value of the property. This factor typically was between $7.5 \\%$ and $25 \\%$ or a 1.075 to 1.25 factor (see Indianapolis Water Co., P.U.R. Ann. 1923, D 449,\n\n3. What experience and training do you have generally relating to a going concern factor for the NMU system?\n\nI am not an appraiser for this assignment and can only provide consulting input considering the normal questions, my knowledge of the system, and my knowledge of the Village utility operations and management. I have owned water and wastewater utilities and have sold them. I have participated in hundreds of negotiations/transactions/cases/etc. I am a utility professional engineer registered in Illinois and I do specialize in water, sewer and other\nmatters. I am an accre I have managed utilities on senior appraiser with the public utility specialty. hiring and training of utility operational and mary basis and assisted in the have performed numerous rate and charge management professionals. I revenue bond or other debt instruments. Ihave tudies and certified to many as an expert witness at several public service commissions been accepted acquisition proceedings. With the a service commissions on rate and can provide consulting input for consideration.\n\n4. What are the normal questions that need to be answered?\n\nWhat is the context of the transaction? It is a full fair market value context with a willing and knowledgeable buyer and seller. How does the NMU system fit into the Aqua family of utilities? It is a relatively large and more established system similar to Aqua's Kankakee base, which could be a base link for their two divisions to the north and to the southeast. It will give the company the initial growth in customers to economy of scale. Can the service area be expanded to include more customers? The service area is essentially built out, yet there is a provision in the Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) which provides a long term cost effective water supply for NMU and provides the ability for Aqua to purchase wholesale and resale to the other utilities surrounding the service area with a cost-effective wholesale price versus the other major whe area with a cost-effective at prices estimated to be quite favorable by mide provider (City of Chicago) the wholesaler of choice for water quality mid-year 2020. Aqua could be Will there be a significant addition quality and price at that time. customers?",

        "text": "No since the customer base is adjacent and the systems have emergency interconnections presently with meters etc.\nWhat additional staff would be needed for these customers? None.\nWhat is the rate situation? Do the present utility rates reasonably reflect fiscal reality?\nYes, not only are the rates appropriate, but in the future the cost of service will decrease do to a lowering of the wholesale water rate?\nWhat is the maintenance program of the utility?\nThe Village not only had a superior maintenance program for the last 7 years, but also the renewal and replacement program has activity and efficiency tracking and performance standards. The Village has annually cleaned the sewer system, which is superior to industry standards. The water meters have all been replaced and generally the management and operations of the systems is superior to the industry. The Village has basically fixed-up the system since acquiring it and made the operations quite efficient.\nWhat is the utility's compliance with local, state and federal regulations?\nThe NMU system is in full compliance with all local, state and federal regulations.\nWhat is the state of the system's technology?\nIt is a simple system to start with and does not need much in technology. Nonetheless, the system is completely controlled by a SCADA system. The system that has been installed operates the three re-pumping stations. There are no treatment plants.\nWhat is the duration of the wholesale water supply agreement (WSA)? 6 years to $6 / 2020$ and then 30 years thereafter with two additional 10-year term extensions provided for a total of 56 years.\nWhat are the motivations of the owner/Village?\nThe NMU system is a satellite system, remote to the Village's central system and was an investment by the Village. The Village wishes to recapture their equity from the system, provide long-term cost-effective wholesale water service to the NMU customers, and focus on the residents within the Village limits (NMU is completely outside of the Village).\nWill there be competition or cooperation?\nAs evidenced by the provisions of the APA and WSA their will be long term cooperation and assistance between the parties enhancing both entities.\n\nIn summary, the proposed transaction has a high level of going concern. I would advise the consideration of a $15 \\%$ to $20 \\%$ increment of assembly value or a 1.15 to 1.20 going concern factor.\n\n5. Could you estimate the costs of the various intangible items for NMU?\n\nMy estimates are only advisory and should not be considered to the level of detail associated with a full appraisal.",

Water allocation for Lake Michigan--- The initial allocation and the amendments thereafter with IDNR are an important right to be transferred. In western water systems the water rights are valued separately and added to the system value. That is not the case for the NMU system.\n\nThe above exercise is not exhaustive and not at the level of an appraisal.
