Starting January 1, 2015, coverage for pediatric dental care will be part of your medical policy and subject to your medical deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nYou may be able to get financial help, called a subsidy, if you have a modified adjusted gross income of $\\$ 11,670$ to $\\$ 46,680$ for individuals (or $\\$ 23,850$ to $\\$ 95,400$ for a family of four).
