Lasses were valued at nearly $\\$ 57,500,000$. Ninety percent of the loss occurred in the North Central States, much of it in the heart of the Corn Belt. In some years, when weather conditions have been more favorable to the borer, losses have been several times greater than in 1951. In 1949, for instance, losses were estimated at 314 million bushels, or about 10 percent of the total corn crop that year.\n\nCorn is a 5 billion-dollar crop in the United States--greater in dollar value than any other crop. The urgent need for high-level feed grain production this year and the importance of corn as a livestock feed calls for an all-out fight to bring the European corn borer under control.\n\nSince corn growers are on the front lines of this fight, their first obligation is to be thoroughly acquainted with the facts about borers and the newest methods of control. One of the best ways to keep up on the methods developed by research is to attend community borer-control meetings held by county agricultural agents. At these meetings, farmers can learn about cultural practices, plow attachments, methods of destroying cornstalks and debris, habits of the borer, how to recognize infestation, which hybrids to use, what time to plant, and when and how to apply insecticides. The principal methods of controlling the borer are listed on the back of this sheet.\n\nHere are the States now known to be infested with the European corn borer:\n\\begin{tabular}{llll} \nAlabama & Kansas & Montana & Pennsylvania \\\\\nArkansas & Kentucky & Nebraska & Rhode Island \\\\\nColorado & Maine & New Hampshire & South Carolina \\\\\nConnecticut & Maryland & New Jersey & South Dakota \\\\\nDelaware & Massachusetts & New York & Tennessee \\\\\nGeorgia & Michigan & North Carolina & Vermont \\\\\nIllinois & Minnesota & North Dakota & Virginia \\\\\nIndiana & Mississippi & Ohio & West Virginia \\\\\nIowa & Missouri & Oklahoma & Wisconsin\n\\end{tabular}",

        "text": "Use These Methods To Control Borers\n\nApply Insecticides-Spraying or dusting with DDT or ryania at the right time and in the correct way is one of the most important methods of controlling the borer to boost yields on the 1952 corn crop. Unless you know the latest recommended methods, consult your county agent or farm adviser on how and when to use them.\n\nIn deciding whether to treat corn with insecticides, consider the value of the crop and the amount of infestation. Treat field corn if 50 or more egg masses per 100 plants can be found, or if extensive leaf feeding is present on early corn and the corn is more than 35 inches tall when the first brood of borers appears.\n\nFor the best protection, treat every field of corn that needs it, whether market sweet corn, canning corn, seed corn, or corn for feed.\n\nUse Adapted Hybrids--If seed for this year's crop is not already purchased, get hybrid seed of well-adapted maturity that are resistant to stalk breaking and ear dropping and are suitable to your locality. Some hybrids, developed through years of research, have resistance to borer damage bred into them. Consult your county agent or farm adviser on the hybrids best adapted to withstand borers.\n\nPlant at Right Time--If corn is not already in the ground, plant it at the time your State Agricultural Experiment Station recommends or which you know by experience will produce best results. For better borer control, avoid unusually early or late planting for your locality. Planting at the right time also increases the yield of good-quality corn and minimizes losses because of early fall frosts.\n\nKill Wintering Borers--The best way to kill borers which survive through the winter is to destroy old cornstalks and stubble by plowing them under and covering completely. Special plow attachments are available to insure coverage in the field. When the borers work their way to the top of the ground and find no debris to hide in, they become a ready prey for birds and other borer enemies, or may be killed by adverse weather.\n\nDo not leave cornstalks in the barnyard, fence corners, or exposed elsewhere. Where cornstalks are used for fodder, destroy the borers by recommended methods of shredding or ensiling. Destroy all other corn remnants as further insurance.\n\nFor Further Information--Write for free single copies of:\nThe European Corn Borer--Its Present Status and Methods of Control, FB 1548, Office of Information, U.S.Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D.C.\n\nThe European Corn Borer and Its Control in the North Central States, NCRB22, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, U.S.Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D.
