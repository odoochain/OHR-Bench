By default these are configured as InfiniBand ports, but you have the option to convert these to Ethernet ports.\n\nFor these changes to work properly, the configured port must connect to a networking switch that matches the port configuration. In other words, if the port configuration is set to InfiniBand, then the external switch should be an InfiniBand switch with the corresponding InfiniBand cables. Likewise, if the port configuration is set to Ethernet, then the switch should also be Ethernet.\n\nThe DGX A100 is also equipped with one (and optionally two) dual-port connections typically used for network storage and configured by default for Ethernet. These can be configure for InfiniBand as well.\n\n\n园 Note: On the dual-port cards, if one of the ports is configured for Ethernet and the other port is configured for InfiniBand, the following limitations apply.\n- FDR is not supported on the InfiniBand port (port 1 or 2).\n- If port 1 is InfiniBand, then port 2 (Ethernet) does not support $40 \\mathrm{GbE / 10 \\mathrm{GbE}$.\n- If port 1 is Ethernet, then port 2 (InfiniBand) does not support EDR.\n}",

During the OS installation or re-image process, you are presented with a boot menu when booting the installer image. The default selection is Install DGX Software. The installation process then repartitions all the SSDs, including the OS SSD as well as the RAID SSDs, and the RAID array is mounted as /raid. This overwrites any data or file systems that may exist on the OS disk as well as the RAID disks.\n\nSince the RAID array on the DGX A100 system is intended to be used as a cache and not for long-term data storage, this should not be disruptive. However, if you are an advanced user and have set up the disks for a non-cache purpose and want to keep the data on those drives, then select the Install DGX Server without formatting RAID option at the boot menu during the boot installation. This option retains data on the RAID disks and performs the following:\n- Installs the cache daemon but leaves it disabled by commenting out the RUN=yes line in /etc/default/cachefilesd.\n- Creates a / raid directory, leaves it out of the file system table by commenting out the entry containing \"/raid\" in /etc/fstab.\nDoes not format the RAID disks.\nWhen the installation is completed, you can repeat any configurations steps that you had performed to use the RAID disks as other than cache disks.\n\nYou can always choose to use the RAID disks as cache disks at a later time by enabling cachefilesd and adding / raid to the file system table as follows:\n\n1 Uncomment the \\#RUN=yes line in /etc/default/cachefiled.\n2 Uncomment the /raid line in etc/fstab.\n3 Run the following:\na Mount/raid.",

The DGX A100 system is designed with a dedicated BMC Management Port and multiple Ethernet network ports.\n\nWhen installing the DGX A100 system in the data center, follow best practices as established by your organization to protect against unauthorized access.\n\n12.1.1 Securing the BMC Port\n\nNVIDIA recommends that the BMC port of the DGX A100 system be connected to a dedicated management network with firewall protection. If remote access to the BMC is required (such as for a system hosted at a co-location provider), it should be accessed through a secure method that provides isolation from the internet, such as through a VPN server.\n\n12.2 SYSTEM SECURITY MEASURES\n\nThe NVIDIA DGX A100 system incorporates the following security measures.",

Since most DGX A100 software updates are accomplished through an over-the-network process with NVIDIA servers, this section explains how updates can be made when using an over-the-network method is not an option. It includes a process for installing Docker containers as well.\n\nA. 1 INSTALLING NVIDIA DGX A100 SOFTWARE\n\nOne method for updating DGX A100 software on an air-gapped DGX A100 system is to download the ISO image, copy it to removable media and then re-image the DGX A100 System from the media. This method is available only for software versions that are available as ISO images for download.\n\nAlternately, you can update the DGX A100 software by performing a network update from a local repository. This method is available only for software versions that are available for over-the-network updates.",

Therefore, consideration should be given to installing the equipment in an environment compatible with the maximum ambient temperature ( $\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{ma}}$ ) specified by the manufacturer.\n\nReduced Air Flow -Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such that the amount of air flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not compromised.\n\nMechanical Loading- Mounting of the equipment in the rack should be such that a hazardous condition is not achieved due to uneven mechanical loading.\n\nCircuit Overloading- Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the supply circuit and the effect that overloading of the circuits might have on overcurrent protection and supply wiring. Appropriate consideration of equipment nameplate ratings should be used when addressing this concern.\n\nReliable Earthing- Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should be maintained.\nParticular attention should be given to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit (e.g. use of power strips).\n\n\nB. 9 ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD)\n\n\nCaution: ESD can damage drives, boards, and other parts. We recommend that you perform all procedures at an ESD workstation. If one is not available, provide some ESD protection by wearing an antistatic wrist strap attached to chassis ground -- any unpainted metal surface -- on your server when handling parts.\n\nAlways handle boards carefully. They can be extremely sensitive to ESO. Hold boards only by their edges. After removing a board from its protective wrapper or from the server, place the board component side up on a grounded, static free surface.
