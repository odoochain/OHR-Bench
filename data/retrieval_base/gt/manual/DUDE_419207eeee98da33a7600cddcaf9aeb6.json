        "text": "SAFETY RULES FOR POWER TOOLS\n1) KNOW YOUR POWER TOOL - Read owner's manual carefully. Learn its applications and limitations as well as the specific potential hazards peculiar to this tool.\n2) GROUND ALL TOOLS - UNLESS DOUBLE-INSULATED. If tool is equipped with three-prong plug, it should be plugged into a three-hole electrical receptacle. If adapter is used to accommodate two-prong receptacle, the adapter wire must be attached to a known ground. Never remove third prong.\n3) AVOID DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT. Don't use power tool in damp or wet locations. And keep work area well lit.\n4) KEEP CHILDREN AWAY. All visitors should be kept safe distance from work area.\n5) STORE IDLE TOOLS. When not in use, tools should be stored in dry, high or locked-up place - out of reach of children.\n6) DON'T FORCE TOOL. It will do the job better and safer at the rate for which it was designed.\n7) WEAR PROPER APPAREL. No loose clothing or jewelry to get caught in moving parts. Rubber gloves and footwear are recommended when working outdoors.\n8) USE SAFETY GLASSES with most tools. Also face or dust mask if cutting operation is dusty.\n9) DON'T ABUSE CORD. Never carry tool by cord or yank it to disconnect from receptacle. Keep cord from heat, oil and sharp edges.\n10) DON'T OVERREACH. Keep proper footing and balance at all times.\n11) MAINTAIN TOOLS WITH CARE. Keep tools sharp at all times, and clean for best and safest performance. Follow instructions for lubricating and changing accessories.\n12) DISCONNECT TOOLS. When not in use, before servicing; when changing accessories such as blades, bits, cutters, etc.\n13) AVOID ACCIDENTAL STARTING. Don't carry plugged-in tool with finger on switch.\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY RULES FOR TRIMMERS\n1. Hold Trimmer with both handles as consistently as possible.\n2. Never hold or use the trimming blades close to any part of the body.\n3. Don't pick out twigs from the blade or use your fingers to feed twigs into the cutting blades.\n4. Make certain extension cord is in good condition.",

        "text": "SWITCH\n\nThe sliding, thumb switch is located on the top of the rear handle. Push the button forward toward the motor housing to turn the tool \"ON.\" Slide the button back toward the electric cord to turn the tool \"OFF.\"\n\nOPERATION\n\n\nYour working position should be such that the power cord is always behind the tool and not draped over the shrub or hedge you are clipping. Maintain proper footing and balance and try not to overreach. Wear gloves when trimming thorny or prickly growth. Hold the tool firmly in both hands and push the thumb switch forward to turn the tool \"ON.\"\n\nA wide, sweeping action, feeding the blade teeth straight through the stems, can be used for trimming new growth on shrubs and hedges. To cut older growth, which has thicker stems, use a \"sawing\" movement (Figure 4) as you feed the Trimmer through the growth.\n\nWhen trimming the sides of hedges it is usually best to trim so that the hedge will be narrower at the top than at the bottom (Figure 5). A slight inward taper of the sides, from bottom to top, prevents a broad top from overshadowing lower foliage which could become spindly in growth.\n\n\nFIG. 4\n\n\nFIG. 5",

        "text": "OPERATION\n\nTo obtain exceptionally level hedges, a piece of string can be stretched along the length of the hedge at the desired height to serve as a guide line. The hedge may then be cut to just above the string.\n\n\nLUBRICATION - MOTOR BRUSHES\n\nLUBRICATION - Before lubricating your trimmer, be sure that the switch is in the \"OFF\" position and that the tool's electric cord plug is disconnected from the electrical outlet. The trimmer has self-lubricating bearings except for the commu-tator-end bearing which requires two drops of machine oil twice a year. Place the oil in hole in top of housing. The trimmer blade should be kept clean and oiled frequently, preferably before and after it has been used.\nBRUSHES - If at any time excessive arcing is noticed in the air vents of the motor housing, this could mean that the motor's brushes need replacement. See the back page of this booklet for your nearest Black \\& Decker Service Center where repairs are quickly and economically performed.\n\n\nNO. U-3339 CORD CONNECTOR\n\n\nUse this connection to hold plug and receptacle together. Tool plug should extend through short slot in connector. Push receptacle end of extension cord thru long slot in connector and tie knot in cord as shown. For convenience leave connector on tool plug.",

        "text": "ASSEMBLING HANDLE\n\n\nNo. 8100 TRIMMER: See Figure 1. Handle can be assembled on either side of Trimmer to suit your convenience.\nNo. 8110 \\& No. 8120 TRIMMERS: See Figure 2.\nNo. 8140 TRIMMER: See Figure 3.\n\n\nGROUNDING \\& EXTENSION CORD\n\nYour Trimmer has a grounding system to protect you from electric shock if some damage should occur to the wiring of the tool. This system utilizes a short, approved 3 -conductor power cord and 3 -prong grounding type attachment plug, which should be used with a 3conductor grounding type extension cord, in accordance with the National Electric Code, Canadian Electrical Code, and Underwriters' Laboratories specifications.\nIF YOUR UNIT REQUIRES 125 VOLTS OR LESS IT HAS A PLUG THAT LOOKS LIKE FIG. \"A\". It will fit directly into the proper type of 3 -wire, extension cord grounding receptacle. The tooi is then grounded automatically each time it is plugged into a properly grounded extension cord, which also has a plug that looks like Fig. \"A\".\nShown in Fig. \"B\" is a special grounding adaptor (not allowed in Canada by the Canadian Electrical Code) which is available from your dealer and will permit using the 3 -prong extension cord plug in a 2 -wire receptacle. The green grounding wire extending from the side of the adapter must be connected to a PERMANENT GROUND.\nIF THE UNIT REQUIRES FROM 150 TO 250 VOLTS, IT HAS A PLUG LIKE FIG. \"C\". The extension cord used must have a matching receptacle and the same kind of plug to be used in the proper standard matching 3 -wire grounded wall receptacle. No adapter is available.\n\n\nWe recommend that you NEVER disassemble the tool or try to do any rewiring in the electrical system. Any such repairs should be performed only by B\\&D Service Centers or other qualified service organizations. Should you be determined to make a repair yourself, remember that the green colored wire is the \"grounding\" wire. Never connect this green wire to a \"live\" terminal. If you replace the plug on the power cord, be sure to connect the green wire only to the grounding (longest) prong on a 3-prong plug.\n\nTo prevent loss of power and overheating, a 3-conductor, grounding type extension cord containing adequate sized wire must be used. Use the table below for 120-volt tools. For 220-volt tools, see the same table but use a wire size corresponding to an extension cord length shown which is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the length of extension to be used.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}\nExt. cable length in feet & 50-100 & 150-200 & 300 & 400 \\\\\nRequired wire size (A.W.G.) in cable & 18 & 16 & 14 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
