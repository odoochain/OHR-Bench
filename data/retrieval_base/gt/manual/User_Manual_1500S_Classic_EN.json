For this purpose, monitoring and, where necessary, test procedures must be established and implemented.\nWith correct installation, care, maintenance, and cleaning, WMF coffee machines meet the requirements described above. If care and cleaning of the coffee machine is not carried out properly, dispensing milk beverages will constitute a food hygiene hazard point. Please observe the following points in order to comply with the HACCP cleaning schedule:\n\nSanitise the milk system daily\n- Follow the cleaning instructions for the milk system in the Care chapter.
