First of all, they are carefully engineered so that interiors can be open and post-free without sacrificing the structural rigidity of the buildings. Every building features extra large doors so that access is never a problem. In addition to their primary job of protecting expensive farm equipment, these buildings provide a sheltered work space for servicing and maintenance. For this reason, provision is made for storage of small parts, lubricants, tools, and so on. With everything in one place, repair work can be done more quickly and easily. A variety of accessories have been designed to simplify your shop work.\n\nThe modern, mechanized farm has made the machinery shed one of the primary farm buildings. It is not only important to have one, but important to choose the right one-a building big enough to store your equipment and with ample facilities for servicing it. Weyerhaeuser Farm Designs offer you a choice of sizes and styles... and in every case, these machine sheds will add to the efficiency of your farm operation. Constructed of lumber, these shelters are both economical and durable-and perhaps most important, eadily adaptable to any future needs.\n\nPlans, specifications, and material lists for these and many other farm buildings available at your lumber dealer . . .\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n  \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{MACHINE SHEDS, SHOPS \\& GARAGES} \\\\\n  Plan No: & Title: Page: \\\\\n  3202 & Combination Garage and Sh \\\\\n  3203 & Pole-Type U.M.U.
