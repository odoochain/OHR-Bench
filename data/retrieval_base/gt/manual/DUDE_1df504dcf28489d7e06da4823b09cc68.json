This environment is based on Microsoft ${ }^{\\oplus}$ Windows 2.0, and is designed to allow the enduser to focus on completing tasks rather than learning and using individual applications. Created as an open environment, the HP NewWave environment offers software developers an exciting opportunity to deliver major enduser benefits to their customers.\nIf you own or manage existing Hewlett-Packard office systems equipment and software, you may be interested to understand how you can grow into the HP NewWave environment. In the following pages, we will provide you with an overview of how to progress from some of HP's most popular office systems products to the HP NewWave environment. For additional details on how you may benefit from the HP NewWave environment, contact your local sales representative or applications engineer.\n\nThe Benefits of Growing into the HP NewWave Environment\n\nThe HP NewWave environment provides numerous benefits to endusers. Because it connects people with information naturally and effortlessly, the end-user is presented with a fully-integrated, and more productive working environment.\n$\\square$ Ease of Use. The consistent and predictable graphic user interface makes this environment easy to learn and easy to use. The context-\n\n\nThe HP NewWave Office provides a graphic user interface that makes this environment easy to learn and easy to use.\nsensitive Help facility and computer-based training also assist users while enabling developers to deliver these services more efficiently.\n$\\square$ Seamless Integration Across Applications. People working in the HP NewWave environment can move quickly and easily from one application to another because of the high level of integration. In this way, users can focus on tasks, not the tools used to accomplish them. In fact, the Object Management Facility (OMF) enables end-users to link, combine and manipulate data forms such as text, spreadsheets, graphics, scanned images and voice, creating \"compound objects.\" The OMF also allows these links to be active connections, or \"hot-links.\"\n$\\square$ Integration with Your Organization's Computing Resources. The HP NewWave environment provides each enduser transparent access to\ninformation throughout the entire office system network: mainframes, minicomputers, other PCs, shared peripherals and communication links. In effect, the HP NewWave environment is the end-user's view into the organizations computer resources.\n$\\square$ Agents for Major Productivity Gains. \"Agents\" can be used to automate repetitive tasks throughout the network, freeing the end-user to focus on analysis and action rather than on the gathering of data.\n$\\square$ Built on Industry Standards. The HP NewWave environment is built on industry standard $\\mathrm{MS}^{\\circledR}$ - DOS and Microsoft Windows 2.0. This means the products are compatible with hardware common in today's business settings. Also, these products provide for a natural evolution to $\\mathrm{OS} / 2$ and Presentation Manager, when they become available. Hewlett-Packard is",

The HP NewWave environment allows existing MSDOS applications to run within the environment. \"Encapsulation,\" a technology that allows a shell to be built around an application to make it accessible from within the HP NewWave environment, protects your current investment in software.\n\nThe Pathway to Increased Productivity\n\nWhat paths are available for you to progress into the HP NewWave environment? Following is a brief summary of some of the most popular Hewlett-Packard products and the growth paths available for each.\n\nMany products will be able to be used in the HP NewWave environment with no modifications. In some cases, an upgrade to the most recent version of an application, or the addition of some hardware may be required. The following diagram \"HP NewWave Growth Paths,\" illustrates the various ways you can grow into the HP NewWave environment.\n\nPC Software\n\nAll Vectra Office software applications will be accessible through encapsulation which allows for familiar, MS-DOS-based programs to be integrated into the HP NewWave environment.\n\nGraphics Gallery and Lotus ${ }^{\\circledR}$ 1-2-3 ${ }^{\\circledR}$ will be highly encapsulated so they can create HP NewWave\nenvironment objects.\nExecutive MemoMaker, Executive Card Manager, and AdvanceWrite\n\n\nPlus, in addition to many third-party applications, may be executed in a single step by accessing an area called \"DOS Programs.\" This facility also allows users to run Microsoft Windows 2.0 applications, such as PageMaker ${ }^{\\circledR}$, from the HP NewWave environment.\n\nBusiness System Plus\n\nInformation Access will be integrated with the HP NewWave \"Office.\" This will provide endusers with easy access to information on HP 3000s and mainframes.\n\nThe print-sharing and PC back-up services of Resource Sharing will continue to appear as transparent services. Also, HP NewWave objects may be shared with other users by converting objects to MS-DOS files.\n\nIn fact, the HP NewWave environment will be able to be downloaded from Business System Plus, much as the Vectra Office\napplications are today. This provides greater control and consistency in versions of PC software.\n\nHP DeskManager will continue to provide electronic mail transport services to both HP NewWave environment and existing users. HP NewWave users will be able to read and edit compound documents from other NewWave users.\n\nToday's HP 3000-based terminal users will be able to send and receive mail from the HP NewWave environment. With new converters in HP DeskManager, it will even be possible for HP 3000 terminal-based users to edit some parts of HP NewWave messages. (See the HP DeskManager illustration for details.)\nIf you currently own HP DeskManager, Resource Sharing, Information Access, or any of the Vectra Office Software Packs, you",

For more details, see your local applications engineer.\n\nNetworks\n\nThe HP NewWave environment is supported by a number of different networks. HP OfficeShare StarLAN, ThinLAN, SERIAL and the recently announced StarLAN 10 networks will all support the HP NewWave environment. These networks will require the use of the new OfficeShare III software on servers and end-user systems. HP OfficeShare III will be available in the Spring of 1988. HP StarLAN 10 will be available in the first half of 1988.\n\nFor more details, please contact your local HP application engineer or network specialist.\n\nYour Window to the Future\n\nTake a look at the HP NewWave environment and you'll see an exciting opportunity to be a continuing part of Hewlett-Packard's next generation office system. When you grow into the HP NewWave environment, you can progress beyond your existing system, without leaving your current applications behind.\nProgress to the HP NewWave environment along a smooth growth path, without risking your past investments. And, do it at your own pace. You can begin today with Business System Plus.
