FOREWORD\n0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution on 16 April 1981, after the draft finalized by the Meat Industry Sectional Committee had been approved by the Agricultural and Food Products Division Councll.\n0.2 This Standard has been formulated to prescribe standard methods for estimating the quality of fresh chicken eggs.\n0.3 While preparing this standard, assistance has been derived from the following publications :\n\nGulich, (AR) and Fitzgerald, (JC). Egg grading manual. 1964 : U.S. Department of Agriculture (USA).\n\nHaugh (RR) US Poultry Magazine 43; (1937) 552.\nRomanoff (AL) and Romanoff, (AJ). The avian egg. 1949 John Willey and Sons, New York (USA).\n0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated. expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.\n\n1. SCOPE\n1.1 This standard prescribes methods of sampling and test necessary to determine quality of fresh eggs. It includes external quality factors as they appear under direct examination and internal quality factors as they appear before candling light or when the egg is broken out and measured by Haugh units plus visual examination of the yolk portions.\n\n2. TERMINOLOGY\n2.0 For the purpose of this standard the following definitions shall apply.\n*Rules for rounding off numerical values (revsed).",

SAMPLING AND TESTING\n3.1 Sampling - Twenty eggs should be drawn from a lot at random for estimating the breakout quality of eggs.\n3.2 Testing - Carry out the following tests to determine the egg quality.\n3.2.1 External Quality - Determine the external quality of egg for the parameters given in $\\mathbf{2 . 1}$ and 2.2.",

Note any internal defects.\n3.3.1 Measure the arrcell height by means of aircell gauge while candling prior to breaking.\n3.4 Shell Thickness - After breaking the egg, boil the shell in 2.5 percent sodium hydroxide solution for 5 minutes. Wash and dry in a thermostatically controlled oven at 100 to $105^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours. Determine the thickness of the shell by screw gauge at three different logitudinal points and take the average of the readings.\n3.5 Haugh Unit (HU ) - Haugh unit can be measured by using the interior egg quality calculator. The following precautions should be followed while estimating the same:\ni) The internal temperature of eggs should not be lower than $7^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ or hugher than $15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ at the time of performing the breakout test.\nii) Care should be exercised to see that the thick white is not punctured while breaking.\niii) One egg at a time should be broken since it is important to measure the albumen height immediately after breaking.\niv) Measurement of height of thick albumen should be made with the help of a spherometer or H tugh meter or micrometer as given in Fig. 1.\nv) Care should be taken to avoid measuring the albumen height in an area where there is a chalaza for air bubble.\n3.5. 1 Eggs removed from the refrigerator should be kept for three hours at ambient temperature of $23^{\\circ}+2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Determine the Haugh unit reading of the eggs by the following procedure:\na) Check the zero reading by placing the instrument on a flat surface and lowering the plung until the point touches the surface. The pointer should be at zero. If not, slacken the clamp and turn the bezol so that the zero mark coincides with the pointer. Retract the point upwards to its full extent.\nb) Open the egg on to a flat glass plate of sufficient size to contain it, place the instrument over the egg, and lower the point until just touches the albumen The height is then indicated on the dial.",
