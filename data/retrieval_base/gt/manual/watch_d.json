During the measurement, the wrist is pressed by the airbag, which may result in the blood flow to your fingertips slowing down and cause blood stasis. In this case, take off your watch, raise your arm high, and repeatedly make a fist and open it for about 15 times.\n\nThe blood pressure measured at home is different from that measured at the hospital\n- If the blood pressure measured at home is lower than that measured at the hospital, the possible causes are as follows:\n- You feel more stressed at the hospital, resulting in the blood pressure higher than it should be.\nYou have greater peace of mind and your body is more relaxed at home, sometimes resulting in the blood pressure lower than that measured at the hospital.\n- The measurement results will be lower if the measurement position is above the heart.\nThe measurement results may be lower if your wrist is above your heart during the measurement.\n- If the blood pressure measured at home is higher than that measured at the hospital, the possible causes are as follows:",
