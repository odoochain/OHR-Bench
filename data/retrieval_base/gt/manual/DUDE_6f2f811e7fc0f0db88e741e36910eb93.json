        "text": "IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS (FOR ALL TOOLS)\n\nWARNING: When using Electric Tools basic safety precautions should always be followed to reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, and personal injury, including the following:\n\nREAD ALL INSTRUCTIONS\n1. KEEP WORK AREA CLEAN. Cluttered areas and benches invite injuries.\n2. CONSIDER WORK AREA ENVIRONMENT. Don't expose power tools to rain. Don't use power tools in damp or wet locations. Keep work area well lit.\n3. GUARD AGAINST ELECTRIC SHOCK. Prevent body contact with grounded surfaces. For example: pipes, radiators, ranges, refrigerator enclosures.\n4. KEEP CHILDREN AWAY. All visitors should be kept away from work area. Do not let visitors contact tool or extension cord.\n5. STORE IDLE TOOLS. When not in use, tools should be stored in dry, and high or locked-up place-out of reach of children.\n6. DON'T FORCE TOOL. It will do the job better and safer at the rate for which it was intended.\n7. USE RIGHT TOOL. Don't force small tool or attachment to do the job of a heavy-duty tool. Don't use tool for purpose not intended, for example, don't use circular saw for cutting tree limbs or logs.\n8. DRESS PROPERLY. Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry. They can be caught in moving parts. Rubber gloves and nonskid footwear are recommended when working outdoors. Wear protective hair covering to contain long hair.\n9. USE SAFETY GLASSES. Also use face or dust mask if cutting operation is dusty.\n10. DON'T ABUSE CORD. Never carry tool by cord or yank it to disconnect from receptacle. Keep cord from heat, oil, and sharp edges.\n11. SECURE WORK. Use clamps or a vise to hold work. It's safer than using your hand and it frees both hands to operate tool.\n12. DON'T OVERREACH. Keep proper footing and balance at all times.\n13. MAINTAIN TOOLS WITH CARE. Keep tools sharp and clean for better and safe performance. Follow instructions for lubricating and changing accessories. Inspect tool cords periodically and if damaged have repaired by authorized service facility. Inspect extension cords periodically and replace if damaged. Keep handles dry, clean, and free from oil and grease.\n14. DISCONNECT TOOLS. When not in use, before servicing, and when changing accessories, such as blades, bits, cutters.\n15. REMOVE ADJUSTING KEYS AND WRENCHES. Form habit of checking to see that keys and adjusting wrenches are removed from tool before turning it on.\n16. AVOID UNINTENTIONAL STARTING. Don't carry plugged-in tool with finger on switch. Be sure switch is off when plugging in.\n17. OUTDOOR USE EXTENSION CORDS. When tool is used outdoors, use only extension cords intended for use outdoors and so marked.\n18. STAY ALERT. Watch what you are doing. Use common sense. Do not operate tool when you are tired.\n19. CHECK DAMAGED PARTS. Before further use of the tool, a guard or other part that is damaged should be carefully checked to determine that it will operate properly and perform its intended function. Check for alignment of moving parts, binding of moving parts, breakage of parts, mounting, and any other conditions that may affect its operation. A guard or other part that is damaged should be properly repaired or replaced by an authorized service center unless otherwise indicated elsewhere in this instruction manual. Have defective switches replaced by authorized service center. Do not use tool if switch does not turn it on and off.\n20. DO NOT OPERATE portable electric tools near flammable liquids or in gaseous or explosive atmospheres. Motors in these tools normally spark, and the sparks might ignite fumes.",

        "text": "DOUBLE-INSULATION\n\nYour tool is DOUBLE-INSULATED to give you added safety. This means that it is constructed throughout with TWO separate \"layers\" of electrical insulation or one DOUBLE thickness of insulation between you and the tool's electrical system.\n\nTools built with this improved insulation system are not intended to be grounded. As a result, your tool is equipped with a two-prong plug which permits you to use any conventional 120 volt electrical outlet without concern for maintaining a ground connection.\n\nNOTE: DOUBLE-INSULATION does not take the place of normal safety precautions when operating this tool. The improved insulation system is for added protection against injury resulting from a possible electrical insulation failure within the tool.\n\nCAUTION: When servicing Double-Insulated Tools, use ONLY IDENTICAL REPLACEMENT PARTS. Repair or replace damaged cords.\n\nSAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nEXTENSION CORDS\n\nDouble insulated tools have 2 wire cords, and can be used with 2 wire or 3 wire extension cords. Only round jacketed extension cords should be used, and we recommend that they be listed by Underwriters Laboratories (U.L.). If the extension will be used outside, the cord must be suitable for outdoor use. Any cord marked as outdoor can also be used for indoor work.\n\nAn extension cord must have adequate wire size (AWG or American Wire Gauge) for safety, and to prevent loss of power and overheating. The smaller the gauge number of the wire, the greater the capacity of the cable, that is 16 gauge has more capacity than 18 gauge. When using more than one extension to make up the total length, be sure each individual extension contains at least the minimum wire size.\n\nTo determine the minimum wire size required, refer to the chart below:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multicolumn{9}{|c|}{CHART FOR MINIMUM WIRE SIZE (AWG) OF EXTENSION CORDS} \\\\\n  NAMEPLATE & \\multicolumn{8}{|c|}{TOTAL EXTENSION CORD LENGTH-FEET} \\\\\n  RATING-AMPS & 25 & 50 & 75 & 100 & 125 & 150 & 175 & 200 \\\\\n  0-10.0 & 18 & 18 & 16 & 16 & 14 & 14 & 12 & 12 \\\\\n  10.1-13.0 & 16 & 16 & 14 & 14 & 14 & 12 & 12 & 12 \\\\\n  13.1-15.0 & 14 & 14 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & - \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nBefore using an extension cord, inspect it for loose or exposed wires, damaged insulation, and defective fittings. Make any needed repairs or replace the cord if necessary. Black \\& Decker has extension cords available that are U.L. listed for outdoor use.\n\nMOTOR\n\nYour Black and Decker tool is powered by a B\\&D-built motor. Be sure your power supply agrees with nameplate marking. 120 Volts $50 / 60 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ or 120 Volts AC Only means Alternating Current (normal 120 volt, 60 cycle house current). Voltage decrease of more than $10 \\%$ will cause loss of power and overheating. All B\\&D tools are factory-tested; if this tool does not operate, check the supply line for blown fuses; plug and receptacle for contact.",

This may chip or damage blades. NOTE-Do not use chipped or damaged blades.\n20. Do not obstruct side chip chute.\n21. Do not operate planer without chip chute in place.\n22. Always use fence unless surface planing. Use extreme caution, stay clear of drive belt and cutter location.\n23. Turn off tool immediately after finishing cut.\n\nSwitch\n\nAlways pick up your planer by the handle before depressing the switch. NOTE: AIways remember to keep free hand away from bottom of planer. The planer is started by depressing the trigger in the handle. To turn the planer off, release the trigger. (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFIG. 1\n\nChip Chute\n\nChip chute can be installed into either side of planer for right hand or left hand discharge of chips. To install, push chute into opening in planer until locking tab snaps in place on opposite side of planer. Locking tab on chute should be on top. Chips will exhaust the side on which chute is installed (Fig. 2). To remove chute, hold locking tab down and push through opening in handle area.\nCAUTION: DO NOT OPERATE TOOL WITHOUT CHIP CHUTE. DO NOT INSERT CHIP CHUTE INTO CHUTE OPENING WITH EXTREME FORCE. DAMAGE TO STOP TAB MAY OCCUR.",

        "text": "FIG. 4\n\nPlaning\n\nWith one hand holding the handle, place the front shoe on the work making certain blades are not touching the work. Put pressure on the handle so that the front shoe is absolutely flat on the work (Fig. 5). Start to plane with motor running at full speed. NOTE: Shallow passes will produce a smoother surface than one deep one.\n\nIn the beginning and in the end of planing, be especially careful to keep your planer flat on the work (Fig. 6\\&7).\n\n\nAdjusting Planing Depth\n\nUnplug the planer\nThe adjustment of the desired depths is accomplished by turning shoe adjusting knob in a clockwise direction as illustrated in Fig. 4.\n\nThe adjusting cutting depths are from 0 to $1 / 16^{\\prime \\prime}(1.5 \\mathrm{~mm})$ and can be read on scale.\n\nA full turn of the knob adjusts the tool to its maximum cutting depths of $1 / 16^{\\prime \\prime}(1.5 \\mathrm{~mm})$.\n\nTurning the knob counterclockwise will decrease the cutting depths.\n\nFirst, set the planing depth to zero by placing a straight edge along the bottom of the tool and adjusting the front shoe until the front and stationary shoes are of equal height (Fig. 3). (At this point, no light will pass between the shoes and the straight edge.) With the tool thus adjusted to zero planing depth, set the desired depth by aligning the indicator on the adjusting knob with the figure indicated on the scale around the knob (Fig. 4). Note: arrow on knob aligns with indicator.\n\n\nFIG. 5\n\n\nFIG. 7",

        "text": "Fence Adjustment\n\nThe planer is equipped with an adjustable fence to assist you in planing long pieces. Unplug the planer and mount the fence as shown in Fig. 8\\&9, and use it to guide the planer along the edge of the wood. NOTE: In order for the fence to perform properly, the edge of the wood must be flat and at $90^{\\circ}$ from the surface being planed. NOTE: For proper rabbeting, it is necessary to use fence. Refer to Fig. 11.\n\n\nFIG. 8\n\n\nFIG. 9\n\nRabbeting\n\nUnplug planer.\n\nAdjust shoe adjusting knob to zero. To set depth of cut, loosen knob A, then push stop until it bottoms on shoe. Now push shoe and stop simultaneously up until desired depth on scale aligns with indicator. Tighten knob A (Fig. 10). (Remember that several shallow cuts are better than one deep cut). Before doing any finishing work, make several practice cuts on scrap lumber until you feel comfortable with the planer and rabbeting guide. Maximum rabetting depth is $63 / 64^{\\prime \\prime}(25 \\mathrm{~mm})$. Stock removal in one pass is $1 / 16(1.5 \\mathrm{~mm})$, therefore, several cuts will be required to obtain maximum rabbeting depth of $63 / 64$ $(25 \\mathrm{~mm})$. The shoe will automatically retract to its original position.\n\nAdjustment of Rabbet Width\n\nFor proper rabbeting, it is necessary to use the fence. Refer to Fig. 11. Adjust to desired cutting width by loosening fence clamping knob to preferred setting, then retighten knob.\n\n\nFIG. 10\n\n\nFIG. 11",

        "text": "Edge Chamfering\n\nYour planer has a precision machined groove in the center of the front of the shoe for planing along the edge of the wood. Here, again, it's a good idea to try a piece of scrap wood before doing finish work. Fig. 12.\n\n\nHOW TO CHANGE AND ADJUST BLADES\n\nFor best results, always use sharp blades. Check for damaged blades and replace as necessary. Replacement blades are available at your local Black \\& Decker Service Center. Refer to accessory listing for proper catalog numbers.\nNOTE: Blades are dual edged and reversible for extended cutting life.\n\nTo Change Blades\n1. Unplug the planer.\n2. Insert the metal stand into slots as shown (Fig. 13) and turn unit upside down.\n3. Loosen the three hex head bolts with the \" T \" type wrench provided.\n4. Push down on rabbeting shoe with thumb, slide blade out and turn over or replace with new blade. CAUTION: When changing blades, do not remove guide bar from drum. See Fig. 14.\n5. Rotate drum by hand to make sure blade does not interfere with housing. Check both sides. Adjust blades per alignment instructions.\n6. Repeat procedure for blade \\#2.",

        "text": "To Adjust the Blades \\\\ for Proper Alignment\n\nUnplug the planer.\n1. Loosen the three hex head bolts and with blade installed in the drum, advance blade until it slightly extends above the stationary shoe. See Fig. 15.\n2. Lightly tighten the 3 hex head screws and rotate drum to insure blade is properly spaced. This assures clearance of blade to housing. Blade must be clamped loosely, but free to adjust to proper position.\n3. Place the clear plastic gauge on the stationary shoe as illustrated in Fig. 15, holding gauge firmly against stationary shoe. NOTE: Clear plastic gauge must not touch adjustable shoe.\n4. Rotate blade and drum as illustrated in Fig. 15. Always turn blade in direction shown. As the blade sweeps past the gauge block, it will be adjusted automatically. NEVER TOUCH BLADES. Check, the blade must be flush and parallel to stationary shoe.\n5. Remove gauge and alternately tighten 3 hex head bolts gradually until secure. This procedure prevents misalignment of blade due to clamping forces.\nb. Continue procedure with blade $\\# 2$.\n7. Before you use the tool, adjust knob to 0 cutting depth. Place planer on a wooden surface. In case the blade should remove some material or the planer vibrates intermittently, please repeat the adjustments of the blade once more.\n8. Before doing any finish work, make a few cuts on scrap lumber to assure blades are properly adjusted.\n\n\nACCESSORIES\n\nNOTE: Recommended accessories for this tool are listed in this manual and in Black \\& Decker catalogs. The use of any other accessory may be hazardous.\n33701 -Double edge carbide tipped blades.\n33702 -Adjustable bevel fence.\n33703 -Chip collecting hose with adaptor.\n\nLUBRICATION\n\nAll ball bearings used are factory lubricated to last the life of the bearings.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nAfter every use of the tool, make sure the tool is cleaned out with an air hose and free of all debris.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nTo assure product safety and reliability, repairs, maintenance and adjustment, (including brush inspection and replacement) should be performed by Black \\& Decker Service Centers or other qualified service organizations, always using Black \\& Decker replacement parts.\n\nCOMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL USE WARRANTY\n\nBlack \\& Decker warrants this product for one year from date of purchase.
