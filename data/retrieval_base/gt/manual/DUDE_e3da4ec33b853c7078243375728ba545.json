        "text": "1: Getting started with Community Choice\n\nThis handbook is a guide to benefits for you and your dependents covered under UniCare State Indemnity Plan/Community Choice (the Community Choice plan). These benefits are provided through the Group Insurance Commission (GIC), the state agency responsible for the design and payment of all benefits for state, participating municipalities and other governmental entities’ employees and retirees. This Plan is funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and administered by UniCare.\nUniCare provides administrative services for UniCare State Indemnity Plan/Community Choice including claims processing, customer service, pre-service reviews and case management - at its Customer Service Center in Andover, Massachusetts. UniCare is not the fiduciary or the insurer of the Community Choice plan.\n\nRead this handbook carefully to fully understand your benefits. If you have questions about any of your benefits, see the contact information on page 3.\n\nIntroducing your medical plan\n\nUniCare State Indemnity Plan/Community Choice provides comprehensive coverage for many health services including hospital stays, surgery, emergency care, preventive care, outpatient services and other medically necessary treatment. Keep in mind, however, that benefits differ depending on the service and the provider, and that not all services are covered by the Plan.\n\nPrescription drugs and behavioral health\n$\\square$ Your prescription drug benefits are administered by CVS Caremark. These benefits are described in Part 2 of this handbook (pages 107-121).\n- Your behavioral health benefits are administered by Beacon Health Options. These benefits include coverage for mental health, substance use disorder and the Enrollee Assistance Program (EAP). They are described in Part 3 of this handbook (pages 123-147).\n\nDo you have benefits under another health plan?\n\nIf you or a family member is covered under another health plan, you must let UniCare know about the other plan. When you received your member materials (including this handbook), you should have filled out and returned the Other Health Insurance form. If you have other health coverage and haven't yet filled out this form, please call UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 to request one.\nTo learn more about how UniCare coordinates benefits with other health plans, turn to \"Coordination of Benefits (COB)\" on page 94.",

        "text": "2: What to know about costs\n\nWhat member costs are\n\nMember costs are the costs for medical care that are your responsibility to pay (they are sometimes called out-of-pocket costs). There are three different types of member costs. These costs are separate and unrelated; they apply in different situations and are for different services. The three types of member costs which are described in this chapter are:\n- Deductible - This is a fixed amount you pay toward medical services each year before the Plan starts paying benefits for those services. Once you have paid the full amount, you won't owe any more deductible until the start of the following plan year. See page 21 for details about the deductible.\n- Copays (copayments) - A copay is a set amount you pay when you get certain medical services. For example, you pay a copay when you see your doctor for a sore throat, or when you get outpatient surgery at a hospital. The dollar amount of your copay varies based on the service you're getting and the provider you're using. See pages 21-25 for details about copays.\n- Coinsurance - This is your share of the cost of a covered service when the service isn't covered at $100 \\%$. For example, if the Plan pays $80 \\%$ of the allowed amount for a service, you are responsible for paying the other $20 \\%$. See page 25 .\n$\\int$ Important! You have different copays and coinsurance for certain services at Community Choice and non-Community Choice hospitals. Always use Community Choice hospitals to get the maximum benefit. Appendix B lists all the Community Choice hospitals.\n\nThere are caps that limit how much you could pay each plan year for these member costs. See pages $25-26$ for details about the out-of-pocket limits and the non-Community Choice coinsurance limit.\n\nWhat is a plan year? The plan year starts on July 1 each year and ends the following June 30th.\n\nHow member costs work\n\nWhen UniCare gets a claim for medical services that you or someone in your family had, we subtract any member costs you owe from the amount we pay to that provider. If there is a copay, that gets subtracted first. Then, the deductible - if it applies - is subtracted, and finally the coinsurance, if any. If you owe any member costs, we'll send you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statement that shows you how the claim has been paid and what you owe to the provider.\nAfter receiving payment from UniCare, your provider will send you a bill for the amount of your member costs; that is, the amount UniCare subtracted from the bill before paying the provider.\n\nNote that we process your claims as they arrive at UniCare. This means that your claims may not be paid in the same order in which you got the medical services.",

        "text": "About your deductible\n\nThe deductible is a set amount you pay toward medical services each plan year before UniCare starts paying benefits for those services. Your deductible starts on July 1 each year. Depending on how much a claim is for, it may take more than one claim before your deductible is satisfied (fully paid).\n\nThe deductible applies to many, but not all, covered services. For example, you owe your deductible for inpatient hospital care, but not for occupational therapy. Inpatient hospital care is subject to the deductible, but occupational therapy is not. Chapter 3 shows which services are subject to the deductible.\n\nYou have one deductible that applies to both your medical claims and any claims you have for out-ofnetwork behavioral health (mental health/substance use disorder) services. The deductible amounts are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2. Deductible Amounts\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l}\n  For an individual & $\\$ 300$ for one person \\\\\n  For a family & $\\$ 900$ for the entire family For any one person in the family, the deductible is capped at $\\$ 300$ \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nDeductible for an individual\n\nThe $\\$ 300$ individual deductible is the amount you must pay each plan year before UniCare starts to pay for many medical services and out-of-network behavioral health services.\n\nExample - In July, you get behavioral health services from an out-of-network provider and pay $\\$ 200$ toward your deductible. You now have $\\$ 100$ of your deductible left. In August, you go to a provider for medical care. If this second bill is more than $\\$ 100$, you pay $\\$ 100$ - the rest of your deductible - and the Plan pays the covered amount of the remaining charges. However, if this second bill is less than $\\$ 100$, then the rest of your deductible will be taken the next time you go to a medical or out-of-network behavioral health provider.\n\nDeductible for a family\n\nThe $\\$ 900$ family deductible is the most your family could pay each plan year before UniCare starts to pay for many medical services or out-of-network behavioral health services. The most you'll owe for any one family member is $\\$ 300$, until the family as a whole reaches the $\\$ 900$ limit.\n\nExample - In July, you and your two children go to providers for medical care. All three of you pay $\\$ 250$ deductibles, for a total of $\\$ 750$ toward the family deductible. In August, your spouse goes to an out-of-network behavioral health provider and pays $\\$ 150$ deductible. Even though no single family member has reached the $\\$ 300$ cap, the family deductible of $\\$ 900$ has been met. Therefore, no additional deductible will apply to your family for the rest of the plan year.\n\n\nAbout copays\nA copay (copayment) is a set amount you pay when you get certain medical services. For example, you pay a copay when you see your doctor for a sore throat, or when you get outpatient surgery at a hospital. The dollar amount of your copay depends on what service you're getting, what kind of provider you're seeing, and whether you're using a Community Choice or non-Community Choice hospital. See the tables on pages 24-25 for a list of services and copay amounts.",

        "text": "Copays can work in two ways:\nD Per-occurrence copays - These are copays you pay every time you have a particular service. Per-occurrence copays apply to inpatient hospital care and outpatient surgery at non-Community Choice hospitals. Doctor visits, high-tech imaging, physical therapy, occupational therapy and emergency room visits are also per-occurrence copays.\n- Quarterly copays - You pay quarterly copays only once each calendar quarter, no matter how many times you get that service during the quarter. There are quarterly copays for inpatient hospital care and outpatient surgery at Community Choice hospitals.\n\nWhat is a calendar quarter? The calendar quarters are July/August/September, October/November/December, January/February/March, and April/May/June.\n\nYour copay for inpatient hospital care\n\nYour copay for inpatient hospital services depends on where you go for your care.\nInpatient services at Community Choice hospitals or under special circumstances\nYour copay for inpatient hospital services will be lowest under any of the following circumstances:\n1. You get your inpatient care at a Community Choice hospital\n2. You go to a designated hospital for any of the complex procedures listed in Table 10 (page 52)\n3. You go to a Quality Center and Designated Hospital for a transplant (page 64)\n4. You get care at an acute rehabilitation facility\n\nIn any of these situations, your inpatient hospital copay is a per-person quarterly copay. Each time you or a covered dependent is admitted to a hospital, you owe this copay. However, once you pay this copay during a calendar quarter, you won't have to pay it again for this person during the same quarter.\n\nExample - You are admitted to a Community Choice hospital in July and stay overnight, so you owe this copay. If you are readmitted to a Community Choice hospital in September, you won't owe another copay because July and September are in the same calendar quarter. But if you are readmitted to a hospital in November, you will have to pay the copay again.\n\nInpatient services at non-Community Choice hospitals\n\nWhen you use a non-Community Choice hospital, the inpatient copay is a per-person, per-admission copay. You must pay this copay each time you or a covered dependent is admitted to a non-Community Choice hospital for anything other than the cases listed above (and again in Table 4 on page 24). You will also owe coinsurance when you get inpatient services at a non-Community Choice hospital.\n\nExample - You are admitted to a non-Community Choice hospital in July and stay overnight, so you owe this copay. If you are readmitted to a non-Community Choice hospital in September, you owe another copay even though the admissions are in the same calendar quarter, because the inpatient copay applies to each admission.\n\nInpatient readmissions\n\nIf you are readmitted to either a Community Choice or non-Community Choice hospital within 30 days of the date of your last hospital stay, you won't owe another inpatient hospital copay if both admissions are in the same plan year. This is true even if the two admissions occur in different calendar quarters.",

You don't owe another copay, even though the admissions are in different calendar quarters. But if you are readmitted to a hospital in November (more than 30 days from your September discharge), you will have to pay the copay again.\n\nIf you have two hospital admissions in different plan years, you will owe a copay for each admission, even if the readmission occurs within 30 days.\n\nExample - You are admitted to the hospital at the end of June and then are readmitted in the beginning of July. You must pay a copay for each admission, even though the two admissions occur within 30 days of each other.\n\nYour copay for outpatient surgery\n\nYour copay for outpatient surgery depends on where you have your surgery.\n\nOutpatient surgery at Community Choice hospital locations\n\nThe outpatient surgery copay at Community Choice hospitals is a per-person quarterly copay. Each time you or a covered dependent has outpatient surgery at a Community Choice hospital, you owe this copay. However, once you pay this copay during a calendar quarter, you won't have to pay it again for this person during the same quarter.\n\nExample - You have outpatient surgery at a Community Choice hospital in July, so you owe the outpatient surgery copay on the hospital charges. If you have another outpatient hospital surgery in September, you won't owe another copay, because July and September are in the same calendar quarter. But if you have outpatient surgery at a hospital in November, you will have to pay the copay again.\nOutpatient surgery at non-Community Choice hospital locations\nThe outpatient surgery copay at a non-Community Choice hospital is a per-person, per-occurrence copay. You must pay this copay each time you or a covered dependent has surgery at one of these hospitals. You will also owe coinsurance when you have outpatient surgery at a non-Community Choice hospital.\n\nExample - You have outpatient surgery at a non-Community Choice hospital in July, so you owe the outpatient surgery copay. If you have another outpatient hospital surgery in September, you owe another copay even though the admissions are in the same calendar quarter, because the outpatient surgery copay at a non-Community Choice hospital applies to each admission.\n\nOutpatient surgery at non-hospital-owned locations\n\nThere's no outpatient surgery copay if you have your surgery at a non-hospital-owned ambulatory surgery center or doctor's office.\n\nCopays for office visits and other services\n\nTable 3 lists the copays you will have for office visits and services with different kinds of providers, including primary care providers and specialists.\nImportant! Some specialists may also provide primary care. If so, they will be considered specialists when we determine their tier and copay assignments. This means you will pay the specialist office visit copay whether you see the specialist for a primary care or specialty care visit.",

The Plan has established allowed amounts for most services from providers.\n\nAbout balance billing\n\nThe allowed amount for a given service may not be the same as what a provider actually charges. When a provider asks you to pay for charges above the allowed amount (that is, above the amount paid by insurance), it is called balance billing.",

    {
        "text": "The Plan doesn't cover balance bills, and balance bills don't count toward your out-of-pocket limits or your non-Community Choice coinsurance limit. By law, Massachusetts providers aren't allowed to balance bill you. However, providers in other states may do so.\n\nSee \"How to use your plan wisely\" on pages 76-77 for ways to avoid being balance billed.\n\nWhen you get care in Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts medical providers are not allowed to balance bill you for charges over the allowed amount (Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32A: Section 20). If a Massachusetts provider balance bills you, contact UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 for help resolving this issue.\n\nWhen you travel\n\nIf you travel outside of either Massachusetts or the state where you live, you can be balance billed if you get medical care. Providers in other states may balance bill you for the difference between the Plan's allowed amount and the provider's charges.\n\nIf you need urgent care when you travel, you will not be balance billed as long as you go to a Travel Access provider (page 79). Keep in mind, however, that Travel Access providers are for urgent care only. If you get elective care in another state, you may be balance billed by any provider. Since the Plan doesn't cover balance bills, payment is your responsibility.\n\nBehavioral health services - You must use a provider in the Beacon Health Options network to avoid getting balance billed for mental health and substance use disorder services, both in and outside of Massachusetts. Behavioral health and EAP benefits are administered by Beacon, not by UniCare. See Part 3 (pages 123-147) for information about these benefits.\n\nAbout preferred vendors\n\nPreferred vendors are providers who have contracted with UniCare to accept the Plan's allowed amounts. This means that you won't be balance billed as long as you use preferred vendors for the following services:\n- Durable medical equipment (DME)\n- Home health care\n- Home infusion therapy\n- Medical / diabetes supplies\n\nServices from preferred vendors are covered at $100 \\%$ of the allowed amount.

Keeping these tips in mind will help you avoid paying more than you need to for your care.\n\nFor a description of the different kinds of providers talked about in this section, see \"Types of health care providers\" on pages 77-79.\n\nWhen you get health care in Massachusetts\n$\\square$ See Tier 1 or Tier 2 specialists - Tier 1 and Tier 2 specialists have demonstrated quality and/or cost efficiency in their practices. Your copays are lower when you use Tier 1 or Tier 2 specialists. See pages 79-80 for more information about physician tiering.\n- Use Community Choice hospitals - Your copays are lower at Community Choice hospitals, and all inpatient care and outpatient surgery is covered at $100 \\%$. Non-Community Choice hospitals are covered at $80 \\%$ so you'll owe $20 \\%$ coinsurance, and the copays are higher.\nTo compare your benefits at Community Choice hospitals and non-Community Choice hospitals, see Chapter 3. See Appendix B for a list of Community Choice hospitals.\n$\\square$ Use UniCare preferred vendors - Services from preferred vendors are covered at 100\\%. When you use non-preferred vendors, services are covered at $80 \\%$, so you'll owe $20 \\%$ coinsurance. And, outside of Massachusetts, non-preferred vendors may balance bill you for charges over the Plan's allowed amounts. (Note that your deductible may also apply, no matter which type of vendor you use.)\nIn this handbook, the checkmark $\\sqrt{\\text { identifies services that have preferred vendors. For more }}$ information, see \"About preferred vendors\" on page 27.\n- Have outpatient surgery at a non-hospital-owned location - You don't have an outpatient surgery copay when you have your surgery at a non-hospital-owned ambulatory surgery center or doctor's office.\n- Take advantage of non-hospital-owned walk-in clinics for non-emergency care - You'll have a $\\$ 20$ copay if you go to a walk-in clinic, like an urgent care center, instead of a hospital emergency room. Just make sure the clinic isn't owned by a hospital. Hospital-owned urgent care centers often bill your visits as emergency room treatment, which means you would owe the $\\$ 100$ emergency room copay.\n\nTo avoid being balance billed for care outside Massachusetts\n- If you need urgent care while traveling, use a Travel Access provider - Always use Travel Access providers if you need urgent care when you aren't in Massachusetts.\n- Make sure your out-of-state student dependent uses Travel Access providers - Covered students who attend school outside Massachusetts should use Travel Access providers when they need urgent care. However, to avoid being balance billed, they must get all their non-urgent care - including annual checkups - at home in Massachusetts.",

These benefits are administered by Beacon, not by UniCare. See Part 3 (pages 123-147) for information about these benefits.\n\nProvide notice about certain medical services\n- Be sure to provide notice if you will be having any of the services or procedures listed in Table 1 (pages 16-19). Your benefit may be reduced by up to $\\$ 500$ if you don't provide enough notice. However, if you're outside the continental United States (that is, outside the contiguous 48 states), you aren't required to provide notice.\nIn this handbook, the telephone marks services you need to tell UniCare about and the triangle marks services your provider needs to tell AIM about. For details, see \"When you must provide notice about your care\" on pages 14-19.\n\nTypes of health care providers\n\nThis handbook talks about many different providers of medical care and services. Here's a brief look at what to know about the different kinds of providers.\n\nTo find health care providers, go to the Members page at unicarestateplan.com and choose\nFind a doctor. You can also call UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 for help.\n\nPrimary care providers (PCPs)\n\nWe strongly encourage all UniCare members to choose a primary care provider, or PCP. Having a PCP means working with a provider who is familiar with you and your health care needs. Your PCP can help you understand and coordinate care you get from other providers, such as specialists, who may not know you as well.\nA PCP can be a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or physician whose specialty is family medicine, general medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics or internal medicine.\nImportant! Some specialists may also provide primary care. If so, they will be considered specialists when we determine their tier and copay assignments. This means you will pay the specialist office visit copay, whether you see the specialist for a primary care or specialty care visit.\n\nPatient-Centered Primary Care practices\n\nMany PCPs in Massachusetts belong to practices that are in UniCare's Patient-Centered Primary Care program, part of the GIC's Centered Care Initiative.\nThe Centered Care Initiative seeks to improve health care coordination and quality while reducing costs. PCPs play a critical role in helping their patients get the right care at the right place with the right provider. The central idea is to coordinate health care services around the needs of you - the patient. Because health care is so expensive, Centered Care also seeks to engage providers and health plans on managing these dollars more efficiently.\nThe Patient-Centered Primary Care program is UniCare's application of the Centered Care initiative. Patient-Centered Primary Care practices are Massachusetts primary care practices that participate in the program.\n\nYou can find more information about the Patient-Centered Primary Care program at unicarestateplan.com.",

When you do seek specialty care, you'll have lower office visit copays when you use Tier 1 and Tier 2 specialists.\n\nHospitals\n\nWhen you need inpatient or outpatient hospital services, your costs will be lowest when:\n- You go to a Community Choice hospital for your care (Appendix B).\n- You go to a designated hospital for any of the procedures listed in Table 10 (page 52).\n- You go to a Quality Center or Designated Hospital for a transplant (page 64).\n- You get care at an acute rehabilitation facility.\n\nYou'll have higher member costs for all other inpatient and outpatient hospital care at non-Community Choice hospitals. See Chapter 2, \"What to know about costs,\" for more information.\n\nUrgent care centers\n\nUrgent care centers are groups of providers who treat conditions that should be checked right away, but that aren't as severe as emergencies. They can often do X-rays, lab tests and stitches. Using an independent urgent care center instead of a hospital emergency room saves you money. Be aware, however, that facilities owned and operated by hospitals are hospital sites, not urgent care centers, and often bill your visit as an emergency room visit.\n\nPreferred vendors\n\nPreferred vendors are providers who have contracted with UniCare to accept the Plan's allowed amounts for one or more of the following services:\n- Durable medical equipment (DME)\n- Home health care\n- Home infusion therapy\n- Medical / diabetes supplies\n\nServices from preferred vendors are covered at $100 \\%$ of the allowed amount.

Physician tiering is a program implemented by the Plan whereby Massachusetts specialists are assigned to different tiers based on an extensive evaluation of both their quality and cost efficiency.\n\nUnder this program, we assign individual Massachusetts specialists to tiers based on how they score on quality and/or cost efficiency compared to the other physicians in the same specialty. We use this comparison to place specialists into one of three tiers, as described below. The names of the tiers have been assigned by the GIC for use uniformly across all of its participating health plans.\n```\n***Tier }1\\mathrm{ (Excellent)\n```\n\nTier 1 specialists have met or exceeded the quality threshold we established for their specialty. Based on our measures, they also showed that they are the most cost efficient compared to their peers in the same medical specialty. Tier 1 is designed to acknowledge the performance of these physicians in terms of both quality and/or cost-efficiency measures, as determined by the available claims data and the standards we use.",

You can also call UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 to request materials.\n\nWe assign specialists to different tiers using data based on the claims that physicians submit and our tiering methodology. We know that using claims data has some limitations. We also know that there are other ways to evaluate physicians for their quality or cost efficiency. When you choose your physicians, you may rely on other information that we cannot get through claims data. You may also rely on your own views about what quality means.

        "text": "How UniCare reimburses providers\n\nThe Plan routinely reimburses providers on a fee-for-service basis. As various models of health care reform are put in place, as anticipated by legislation in Massachusetts, the Plan may engage certain providers in shared savings and loss arrangements where providers receive additional payments for meeting quality and cost targets. Explanations of this type of provider payment will be available on the Plan website and on request as they are put in place. In this Plan, providers may discuss the way they are compensated with you.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nTo receive benefits from the Plan, a claim must be filed for each service. Most hospitals, physicians and other health care providers will submit claims for you. If your provider files claims on your behalf, the provider will be paid directly. If you submit your own claim, you must provide written proof of the claim that includes:\n- Diagnosis\n- Date of service\n- Amount of charge\n- Name, address and type of provider\n- Provider tax ID number, if known\n- Name of enrollee\n- Enrollee's ID number\n- Name of patient\n- Description of each service or purchase\n- Other insurance information, if applicable\n- Accident information, if applicable\n- Proof of payment, if applicable\n\nIf the proof of payment you get from a provider contains information in a foreign language, please provide UniCare with a translation, if possible.\n\nUniCare's claim form may be used to submit written proof of a claim. Original bills or paid receipts from providers will also be accepted as long as the information described above is included.\nㅁㅗㅐ You can print or request a claim form from unicarestateplan.com, or call UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 to request a form.\n\nClaims for prescription drug or behavioral health services - These claims must be submitted directly to the administrator of those services. For prescription drug claims, see Part 2 (pages 107-121). For mental health, substance use disorder and EAP claims, see Part 3 (pages 123-147).\n\nDeadlines for filing claims\n\nWritten proof of a claim must be submitted to UniCare within two years of the date of service. Claims submitted after two years will be accepted for review only if you show that the person submitting the claim was mentally or physically incapable of providing written proof of the claim in the required amount of time.",

The Plan encourages you to review all of your medical bills for accuracy, just as you might do with your utility bills. If you find a billing error and get a corrected bill from your provider, you will share in any actual savings realized by the Plan.\n\nWhat you need to do\n\nYou must ask the provider to send you an itemized bill for the services you received. As soon as possible, review this bill for any charges that indicate treatment, services or supplies that you did not receive. Check items such as:\n\nD Did you receive the therapy described on the bill?\n- Did you receive X-rays as indicated on your bill?\n- Are there duplicate charges on the same bill?\n- Have you been charged for more services than you received?\n- Did you receive the laboratory services described on the bill?\n\nDoes the room charge reflect the correct number of days?\n- Were you charged for the correct type of room?\n\nIf you find an error\n\nIf you find an error, contact the provider or the provider's billing office and report the exact charges you are questioning. Request an explanation of any discrepancies and ask for a revised itemized bill showing any adjustments.\n\nHow to get your share of the savings\n\nTo receive your share of the savings, you must send copies of both the original and revised bills to the Plan, along with the completed Bill Checker form. A Bill Checker form can be found in Appendix C.\n\n品 You can also download this form from unicarestateplan.com.\nBe sure to include the enrollee's name and identification number on the Bill Checker form. The Plan will review the two bills and, if a billing error is confirmed, you will receive $25 \\%$ of any savings that the Plan realizes. All reimbursements are subject to applicable state and federal income taxes.\n\nProvider bills eligible under the program\n\nAll bills that UniCare provides the primary benefits for are eligible under the Bill Checker program. Members who have Medicare as their primary coverage cannot use Bill Checker. This program may not apply to certain inpatient bills paid under the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) methodology. Bills for prescription drugs and behavioral health services are also excluded because UniCare does not administer those benefits.",

        "text": "About claim reviews\n\nUniCare routinely reviews submitted claims to evaluate the accuracy of billing information. We may request written documentation such as operative notes, procedure notes, office notes, pathology reports and X-ray reports from your provider.\n\nReviews for fraud and other inappropriate activity\n\nTo detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity, UniCare reviews claims both before and after payment. If a claim is denied as a result of this review, the provider - whether in Massachusetts or elsewhere - may bill the member. A claim under this review may be denied if the provider fails to submit medical records associated with the claim.\n\nIn cases of suspected claim abuse or fraud, UniCare may require that the person whose disease, injury or pregnancy is the basis of the claim be examined by a physician selected by the Plan. This examination must be approved by the Executive Director of the GIC, and will be performed at no expense to you.\n\nDeadlines on bringing legal action\n\nYou cannot bring suit or legal action to recover benefits for charges incurred while covered under the Plan any earlier than 60 days, or any later than three years, after UniCare receives complete written proof of the claim. However, if the state where you lived at the time of the alleged loss has a longer time limit, the limit is extended to be consistent with that state's law.\n\nRight of reimbursement\n\nIf you or your dependents receive payments from a third party for an injury or disease that UniCare previously paid claims for, UniCare will have a lien on any money you receive. This lien applies to any money you or your covered dependents receive from, among others, the person or entity responsible for the injury or disease, his or her insurers, or your own auto insurance carrier, including uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.\n\nYou and your dependents will not have to reimburse UniCare for any more than the amount UniCare paid in benefits.\n\nYou or your dependents must execute and deliver any documents required by UniCare or its designee, and do whatever is necessary to help UniCare attempt to recover benefits it paid on behalf of you or your dependents.\n\nAbout your privacy rights\n\nThe GIC's Notice of Privacy Practices appears in Appendix A. This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed, as well as how you can get access to this information. The notice also explains your rights as well as the GIC's legal duties and privacy practices.",

See Appendix E for instructions on how to file an appeal.\n\nAppeals for prescription drug or behavioral health services - These appeals must be filed with the administrator of those services. For prescription drug appeals, see Part 2 (pages 107-121). For mental health, substance use disorder and EAP appeals, see Part 3 (pages 123-147).\n\nHow medical services get reviewed\n\nAs explained in \"When you must provide notice about your care\" on page 14, either UniCare or AIM Specialty Health must be notified if you are scheduled to have any of the services listed in Table 1 (pages 16-19). These services are reviewed to make sure they are eligible for benefits. Pre-service reviews are a standard practice of most health plans. These reviews help ensure that benefits are paid appropriately for services that meet the Plan's definition of medical necessity.\n\nThe clinical criteria used for these reviews are developed with input from actively practicing physicians, and in accordance with the standards adopted by the national accreditation organizations. The criteria are regularly updated as new treatments, applications and technologies become generally-accepted professional medical practice.\n\nA UniCare nurse may speak with your health care providers to determine if a service is eligible for benefits. The nurse will also review your clinical situation and circumstances.\nIf the nurse is unable to make a determination, the Plan will invite your provider to speak with one of UniCare's physician advisors to discuss the proposed treatment and/or the treatment setting. Once a decision is made, UniCare will contact your provider directly, and you will be notified in writing.\n\nAsking for reconsideration if coverage is denied\n\nIf your request has been denied either before or while you are getting health care services, you or your doctor may ask for reconsideration. Your request can be made by phone or in writing. The reconsideration process gives your doctor the opportunity to speak with another clinical peer reviewer who was not involved in the original denial.\n\nFor an immediate reconsideration, the UniCare Customer Service Center must get the request and all supporting information within three business days of when you received the denial. The reconsideration will take place within two business days after all necessary supporting documents have been received. The decision is then communicated in writing to you and your doctor.\n\nIf the denial is upheld, you can appeal the decision. See Appendix E for instructions on how to file an appeal.",

This COBRA notice contains important information about your right to temporarily continue your health care coverage in the GIC's health plan through a federal law known as COBRA. If you elect to continue your coverage, COBRA coverage will begin on the first day of the month immediately after your current GIC coverage ends.\n\nYou must complete and return the GIC COBRA Election Form no later than 60 days after your group coverage ends. You may send it to the GIC's Public Information Unit at P.O. Box 8747, Boston, MA 02114 or hand deliver it to the GIC at 19 Staniford Street, 4th floor, Boston, MA 02114. If you do not submit a completed election form by this deadline, you will lose your right to elect COBRA coverage.\n\nWhat is COBRA coverage?\n\nThe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) is a federal law under which certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses and dependent children have the right to temporarily continue their existing group health coverage at group rates when group coverage otherwise would end due to certain life events, called 'Qualifying Events.' If you elect COBRA coverage, you are entitled to the same coverage being provided under the GIC's plan to similarly situated employees or dependents. The GIC administers COBRA coverage.\n\nWho is eligible for COBRA coverage?\n\nEach individual entitled to COBRA (known as a \"Qualified Beneficiary\") has an independent right to elect the coverage, regardless of whether or not other eligible family members elect it. Qualified Beneficiaries may elect to continue their group coverage that otherwise would end due to the following life events:\n\nIf you are an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or a municipality covered by the GIC's health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage if:\n- You lose your group health coverage because your hours of employment are reduced; or\n- Your employment ends for reasons other than gross misconduct.\n\nIf you are the spouse of an employee covered by the GIC's health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage for yourself if you lose GIC health coverage for any of the following reasons (known as \"qualifying events\"):\n- Your spouse dies;\n- Your spouse's employment with the Commonwealth or participating municipality ends for any reason other than gross misconduct or his/her hours of employment are reduced; or\n- You and your spouse legally separate or divorce.",

If your group coverage ends due to employment termination or reduction in employment hours, COBRA coverage may last for up to 18 months. If it ends due to any other qualifying events listed above, you may maintain COBRA coverage for up to 36 months.\nIf you have COBRA coverage due to employment termination or reduction in hours, your family members' COBRA coverage may be extended beyond the initial 18 -month period up to a total of 36 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if a second qualifying event - the insured's death or divorce - occurs during the 18 months of COBRA coverage. You must notify the GIC in writing within 60 days of the second qualifying event and before the 18-month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage.

A qualified beneficiary may change a prior rejection of COBRA election any time until that date.\nIf you do not elect COBRA coverage within the 60-day election period, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage.\nIn considering whether to elect continuation coverage, you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law, including the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if the plan generally does not accept late enrollees, if you request enrollment within 30 days after your GIC coverage ends. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of continuation coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum time available to you.\n\nHow much does COBRA coverage cost?\n\nUnder COBRA, you must pay $102 \\%$ of the applicable cost of your COBRA coverage. If your COBRA coverage is extended to 29 months due to disability, your cost will increase to $150 \\%$ of the applicable full cost rate for the additional 11 months of coverage. COBRA costs will change periodically.\n\nHow and when do I pay for COBRA coverage?\n\nIf you elect COBRA coverage, you must make your first payment for COBRA coverage within 45 days after the date you elect it. If you do not make your first payment for COBRA coverage within the 45-day period, you will lose all COBRA coverage rights under the plan.\n\nYour first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time your coverage would have ended up to the time you make the first payment. Services cannot be covered until the GIC receives and processes this first payment, and you are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is enough to cover this entire period. After you make your first payment, you will be required to pay for COBRA coverage for each subsequent month of coverage. These periodic payments are due usually around the $15^{\\text {th }}$ of each month. The GIC will send monthly bills, specifying the due date for payment and the address to which payment is to be sent for COBRA coverage, but you are responsible for paying for the coverage even if you do not receive a monthly statement. Payments should be sent to the GIC's address on the bill.\n\nAfter the first payment, you will have a 30-day grace period beyond the due date on each monthly bill in which to make your monthly payment. Your COBRA coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment. If you fail to make a periodic payment before the end of the grace period for that payment, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage.\n\nCan I elect other health coverage besides COBRA?\n\nYes. You have the right to enroll, within 31 days after coverage ends, in an individual health insurance 'conversion' policy with your current health plan without providing proof of insurability. Alternately, you may purchase health insurance through the Commonwealth's Health Connector Authority or through the Health Insurance Marketplace in other states. The GIC has no involvement in conversion programs or the Health Connector programs. You pay the premium to the plan sponsor for the coverage. The benefits provided under such a policy might not be identical to those provided through COBRA.

        "text": "Coordination of Benefits (COB)\n\nIt is common for family members to be covered by more than one health care plan. This happens, for example, when spouses or partners have family coverage through both of their employers or former employers. When you or your dependents are covered by more than one health plan, one plan is identified as the primary plan for coordination of benefits (COB). Any other plan is then the secondary plan. The goal of COB is to determine how much each plan should pay when you have a claim, and to make sure that the combined payments of all plans do not add up to more than your covered health care expenses.\n\nDefinition of plan\n\nFor the purposes of COB, the term plan is defined as any plan that provides medical or dental care coverage. Examples include, but are not limited to, group or blanket coverage; group practice or other group prepayment coverage, including hospital or medical services coverage; labor-management trusteed plans; union welfare plans; employer organization plans; employee benefit organization plans; automobile no-fault coverage; and coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law, including any legally required, no-fault motor vehicle liability insurance. (This does not include a state plan under Medicaid or any plan when, by law, its benefits are in excess of those of any private insurance program or other non-governmental program.)\nThe term plan does not include school-accident type plans or coverage that you purchased on a non-group basis.\n\nDetermining the order of coverage\n\nIf the UniCare State Indemnity Plan is the primary plan, benefit payments will be made as if the secondary plan or plans did not exist. A secondary plan may reduce its benefits if payments were made by the UniCare State Indemnity Plan.\n\nIf another plan is primary, benefit payments under the UniCare State Indemnity Plan are determined in the following manner:\na) The Plan determines its covered expenses - that is, what the Plan would pay in the absence of other insurance; then\nb) The Plan subtracts the primary plan's benefits - benefits paid by the other plan, or the reasonable cash value of any benefits in the form of services - from the covered expenses in (a) above; and then\nc) The Plan pays the difference, if any, between (a) and (b).\n\nThe following are the rules used by the UniCare State Indemnity Plan (and most other plans) to determine which plan is the primary plan and which plan is the secondary plan:\n1. The plan without a COB provision is primary.\n2. The plan that covers the person as an employee, member, or retiree (that is, other than as a dependent) is primary, and the plan that covers the person as a dependent is secondary.\n3. The order of coverage for a dependent child who is covered under both parents' plans is determined by the birthday rule, as follows:\na) The primary plan is the plan of the parent whose birthday falls first in the calendar year, or\nb) If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the primary plan is the plan that has covered a parent for the longest period of time\nHowever, if the other plan has a rule based on the gender of the parent, and if the plans do not agree on the order of coverage, the rules of the other plan will determine the order.",

The UniCare State Indemnity Plan will not have to pay that amount again.\n\nRight of recovery\n\nIf the UniCare State Indemnity Plan pays more than it should have under the COB provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the following:\n- The persons it has paid or for whom it has paid\n- The other insurance company or companies\n- Other organizations\n\nCOB for persons enrolled in Medicare\n\nThe benefits for an enrollee and his or her dependents simultaneously covered by the UniCare State Indemnity Plan and Medicare Part A and/or Part B will be determined as follows:\n1.

You are not entitled to Medicare until after the three-month waiting period. This waiting period can be waived or shortened if a member participates in a self-dialysis training program or is scheduled for an early kidney transplant.\n\nThe Medicare ESRD coordination period is 30 months long and occurs after the ESRD waiting period.

In addition, with the exception of the over-the-counter versions of Preventive Drugs, medications are covered only if a prescription is required for their dispensing. Diabetes supplies and insulin are also covered by the plan.\n\nThe plan categorizes medications into seven major categories:\n\nGeneric Drugs\n\nGeneric versions of brand medications contain the same active ingredients as their brand counterparts, thus offering the same clinical value. The FDA requires generic drugs to be just as strong, pure and stable as brand-name drugs. They must also be of the same quality and manufactured to the same rigorous standards. These requirements help to assure that generic drugs are as safe and effective as brand-name drugs.\n\nMaintenance Drug\n\nA maintenance drug is a medication taken on a regular basis for chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n\nNon-Preferred Brand-Name Drug\n\nA non-preferred brand-name drug is a medication that usually has an alternative therapeutically equivalent drug available on the formulary.\n\nPreferred Brand-Name Drug\n\nA preferred brand-name drug, also known as a formulary drug, is a medication that has been reviewed and approved by a group of physicians and pharmacists, and has been selected by CVS Caremark for formulary inclusion based on its proven clinical and cost effectiveness.\n\nPreventive Drugs\n\nPreventive drugs consist primarily of drugs recommended for coverage by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and as specified by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

You will receive coverage for additional fills of that medication only if you convert your prescription to a 90-day supply to be filled either through mail service or at a CVS Pharmacy, or if you inform CVS Caremark that you instead prefer to continue to receive 30 -day supplies at a participating retail pharmacy.\n\nCVS Caremark will assist you in transitioning your maintenance prescription to either mail service or a CVS Pharmacy location.\n\nMaintenance Medications - Up to 90 Days\n\nFilling 90-day Prescriptions through CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy or CVS Pharmacy\n\nYou have the choice and convenience of filling maintenance prescriptions for up to a 90-day supply at the mail service copayment, either through the CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy or at a CVS Pharmacy.\n\nMail Service Pharmacy is a convenient option for prescription drugs that you take on a regular basis for conditions such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Your prescriptions are filled and conveniently sent to you in a plain, weather-resistant pouch for privacy and protection. They are delivered directly to your home or to another location that you prefer.\n\nCVS Pharmacy is another option for getting your 90-day maintenance medications for the same copayment amount as mail service. Prescriptions can be filled at one of over 7,400 CVS Pharmacy locations across the country.\n\nConvenient for You\n\nYou get up to a 90-day supply of your maintenance medications - which means fewer refills and fewer visits to your pharmacy, as well as lower copayments. Once you begin using mail service, or the option of your local CVS Pharmacy, you can order refills online or by phone.\n\nUsing Mail Service\n\nTo begin using mail service for your prescriptions, just follow these three simple steps:\n1. Ask your physician to write a prescription for up to a 90 -day supply of your maintenance medication plus refills for up to one year, if appropriate. (Remember also to ask for a second prescription for an initial 30-day supply and take it to your local participating retail pharmacy.)\n2. Complete a mail order form (contained in your Welcome Kit or found online after registering at caremark.com). Or call CVS Customer Care toll free at 877-876-7214 to request the form.\n3. Put your prescription, payment and completed order form into the return envelope (provided with the order form) and mail it to CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy.\n\nPlease allow 7-10 business days for delivery from the time your order is mailed. A pharmacist is available 24 hours a day to answer your questions about your medication.\n\nIf the CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy is unable to fill a prescription because of a shortage of the medication, you will be notified of the delay in filling the prescription. You may then fill the prescription at a retail pharmacy, but the retail pharmacy copayment will apply.",

Prior Authorization ensures that you are receiving the appropriate drug for the treatment of a specific condition, in quantities approved by the FDA. For select drugs, prior authorization also includes a medical necessity review that ensures the use of less expensive first-line formulary prescription drugs before the plan will pay for more expensive prescription drugs. First-line formulary prescription drugs are safe and effective medications used for the treatment of medical conditions or diseases.\n\nIf a drug that you take requires prior authorization, your physician will need to contact CVS Caremark to see if the prescription meets the plan's conditions for coverage.

Our clinicians can verify your coverage and refer you to an in-network provider who matches your specific request (e.g., provider location, gender, or fluency in a second language). Beacon clinicians can also provide you with a referral for brief counseling, or legal, financial, or dependent care assistance through your EAP.\n\nCustomer service representatives are also available from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET to help you with specific benefits or claims questions. ${ }^{1}$\n\nReferral/Prior Authorization for EAP and Non-Routine Services\n\nYou must obtain prior authorization for non-routine outpatient services and inpatient care requests.

Beacon clinicians are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 855-750-8980 (TDD: 866-727-9441) to provide referrals and prior authorization.\nAfter you obtain prior authorization, you can then call the provider of your choice directly to schedule an appointment. Beacon maintains an extensive database at beaconhealthoptions.com/gic where you can search for in-network providers.\n\nIf you (or your provider) do not call Beacon to obtain prior authorization or a referral, your benefits may be reduced or not paid at all.\n\nEmergency Care\n\nYou should seek emergency care if you (or your covered dependents) need immediate clinical attention because you present a significant risk to yourself or others.\n\nIn a life-threatening emergency, you should seek care immediately at the closest emergency facility.\nBeacon will not deny emergency care. However, you, a family member, or your provider must notify Beacon within 24 hours of an emergency admission.\nAlthough a representative may call on your behalf, it is always your responsibility to make certain that Beacon has been notified of an emergency admission. Your benefits may be reduced or denied if you do not notify Beacon.\n\nNote: If you call Beacon seeking non-life threatening emergency care, Beacon will connect you with appropriate services within six hours.\n\nUrgent Care\n\nYou should seek urgent care if you have a condition that may become an emergency if it is not treated quickly. In such situations, our providers will have appointments to see you within 48 hours of your initial call to Beacon. Contact Beacon if you need assistance finding an in-network provider with urgent care appointment availability.\n\n\n1 Supervisors monitor random calls to Beacon Health Options' customer services department as part of Beacon's quality control program.",

However, if you inform Beacon that you are seriously considering harming yourself or others, Beacon is legally required to notify emergency services to ensure your safety, even without your permission.\n\nCoordination of Benefits\n\nYou and your dependents may be entitled to receive benefits from more than one plan. When this occurs, your plans use coordination of benefits (COB) to determine coverage for your mental health and substance use disorder benefits. All benefits under this plan are subject to COB.

        "text": "Part II - Benefits\n\nBenefits Explained\n\nYour Member Costs\n\nDeductible - A deductible is the amount you must pay each plan year before Beacon starts to pay for your out-of-network mental health and substance use disorder (behavioral health) services. You have a deductible of $\\$ 300$ for one person or $\\$ 900$ for the entire family for out-of-network behavioral health treatment. The most you'll owe for any one family member is $\\$ 300$, until the family as a whole reaches the $\\$ 900$ deductible limit. This deductible is shared between all covered medical and out-of-network behavioral health services.\n\nCopayments (copays) - Copays are a set amount you pay when you get certain mental health or substance use disorder services. You have two different types of copays for behavioral health services under this plan:\n\nPer-occurrence copays - These are copays you pay every time you have a particular service. Outpatient visits all have per-occurrence copays.\nQuarterly copays - You pay quarterly copays only once per quarter, no matter how many times you get that service during the quarter. There are quarterly copays for inpatient and intermediate mental health and substance use disorder care. (The quarters are: July/August/September, October/November/December, January/February/March, and April/May/June.)\n\nOut-of-Pocket Limit - The out-of-pocket limit is the maximum amount you will pay in deductibles and copays for your medical, mental health and substance use disorder care in one plan year. When you have met your out-of-pocket limit, all care will be covered at $100 \\%$ of the allowed amount until the end of the year.\n\nYou have two separate out-of-pocket limits: an out-of-pocket limit for in-network services, and an out-of-pocket limit for out-of-network services. Neither limit includes the following:\n- Charges for out-of-network care that exceeds the maximum number of days or visits\n- Charges for care that is not a covered service\n- Charges in excess of Beacon's allowed amounts\n\nIn-Network Benefits\n\nCovered in-network services are paid at $100 \\%$, after copays (see copay schedule in Table 17, below). If you receive multiple outpatient behavioral health services on the same day, from the same provider, you will only pay one copay. (The higher copay will apply).\n\nIn-network behavioral health services are not subject to the deductible.\nThe out-of-pocket limit for in-network services is $\\$ 4,000$ for one person or $\\$ 8,000$ for the entire family, shared with your in-network medical expenses. Only copays for in-network services apply to this limit. Once you reach your in-network out-of-pocket limit in a plan year, all covered in network services you receive are covered at $100 \\%$ until the end of that plan year.",

        "text": "Out-of-Network Benefits\n\nOut-of-network benefits are paid at a lower level than in-network benefits and are subject to deductibles and copays. Out-of-network benefits are paid based on allowed amounts, which are Beacon's \"reasonable and customary\" fees, a percentage of Medicare, or negotiated fee maximums. Allowed amounts are subject to change at any time without notice. If your out-of-network provider or facility charges more than these allowed amounts, you may be balance billed (asked to pay for charges above the allowed amount). Beacon does not cover balance bills.\n\nBeacon's in-network providers must accept the Plan's allowed amounts, so you won't be balance billed as long as you use providers in the Beacon network. Call Beacon at 855-750-8980 (TDD: 866-727-9441) for help finding an in-network provider.\n\nYou have a deductible of $\\$ 300$ for one person or $\\$ 900$ for the entire family for out-of-network mental health and substance use disorder treatment.\n\nThe out-of-pocket limit for out-of-network services is $\\$ 3,000$ for one person. There is no family limit. Your out-of-network out-of-pocket limit applies only to your deductible and copays for out-ofnetwork behavioral health services. Once each covered member reaches his or her out-of-network out-of-pocket limit in a plan year, all covered out-of-network services that person receives are covered at $100 \\%$ of the allowed amount until the end of that plan year.\n\nImportant!

This information can help you decide whether or not to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan.

Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage can be found at the end of this notice.\n\nFor most people, the drug coverage that you currently have through your GIC health plan is a better value than the Medicare drug plans.\n\nThere are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare's prescription drug coverage:\n1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available to everyone with Medicare in 2006. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage.

Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare Part D drug plan.\n\nWhen can you join a Medicare Part D drug plan?\n\nYou can join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each subsequent year from October $15^{\\text {th }}$ to December $7^{\\text {th }}$.\n\nHowever, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two month Special Enrollment Period to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan.\n\nWhat happens to your current coverage if you decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan?\n- If you enroll in another Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with or without prescription drug coverage, you will be disenrolled from the GIC-sponsored CVS Caremark plan. If you are disenrolled from CVS Caremark, you will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.\n\nIf you are the insured and decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan, both you and your covered spouse/dependents will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.\n- If you have limited income and assets, the Social Security Administration offers help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage. Help is available online at socialsecurity.gov or by phone at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778).\n\nWhen will you pay a higher premium (penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan?\n\nYou should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with a GIC plan and don't join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later.\n\nIf you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least $1 \\%$ of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least $19 \\%$ higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay this higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the following November to join.\n\nFor more information about this notice or your current prescription drug coverage ...\n\nContact the GIC at 617-727-2310, extension 1.\nNote: You will receive this notice each year and if this coverage through the Group Insurance Commission changes. You may request a copy of this notice at any time.",

You'll get a copy of the handbook in the mail every year from Medicare. You may also be contacted directly by Medicare drug plans.\n\nFor more information about Medicare prescription drug coverage:\n- Visit medicare.gov.\n\nCall your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (see the inside back cover of your copy of the Medicare \\& You handbook for the telephone number) for personalized help.\n- Call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227); TTY users should call 877-486-2048.\n\nIf you have limited income and assets, extra help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage is available.

If you decide to join one of the Medicare drug plans, you may be required to provide a copy of this notice when you join to show whether or not you have maintained creditable coverage and, therefore, whether or not you are required to pay a higher premium (a penalty).\n\nThe Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)\n\nThe Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) protects the rights of individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave employment positions to undertake military service or certain types of service in the National Disaster Medical System. USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. The GIC has more generous guidelines for benefit coverage that apply to persons subject to USERRA, as set forth below:\n- If you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your dependents while in the military.\n- Service members who elect to continue their GIC health coverage are required to pay the employee's share for such coverage.\n- Even if you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated to GIC health coverage when you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions except for service-connected illnesses or injuries.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations.\n\nFor assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 866-4-USA-DOL or visit its website at www.dol.gov/vets. An interactive online USERRA Advisor can be viewed at www.dol.gov/elaws/userra.htm. If you file a complaint with VETS and VETS is unable to resolve it, you may request that your case be referred to the Department of Justice or the Office of Special Counsel, as applicable, for representation. You may also bypass the VETS process and bring a civil action against an employer for violations of USERRA. The rights listed here may vary depending on the circumstances.",

The ACA brought many benefits to Massachusetts and its residents, helping us expand coverage to more Massachusetts residents, making it more affordable for small businesses to offer their employees healthcare, and providing additional tools to help families, individuals and businesses find affordable coverage. This notice is meant to help you understand health insurance marketplaces, which are required by the ACA to make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the state marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector. While you may or may not qualify for health insurance through the Health Connector, it may still be helpful for you to read and understand the information included here.\n\nOverview\n\nThere is an easy way for many individuals and small businesses in Massachusetts to buy health insurance: the Massachusetts Health Connector. This notice provides some basic information about the Health Connector, and how coverage available through the Health Connector relates to any coverage that may be offered by your employer. You can find out more by visiting: MAhealthconnector.org, or for non-Massachusetts residents, Healthcare.gov or (800-318-2596; TTY: 855-889-4325).\n\nWhat is the Massachusetts Health Connector?\n\nThe Health Connector is our state's health insurance marketplace. It is designed to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health insurance that meets their needs and fits their budget. The Health Connector offers \"one-stop shopping\" to easily find and compare private health insurance options from the state's leading health and dental insurance companies. Some individuals and families may also qualify for a new kind of tax credit that lowers their monthly premium right away, as well as cost sharing reductions that can lower out-of-pocket expenses. This new tax credit is enabled by §26B of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code.\n\nOpen enrollment for individuals and families to buy health insurance coverage through the Health Connector occurs every year. You can find out more by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 877-MA ENROLL (877-623-6765).\n\nCan I qualify for federal and state assistance that reduces my health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses through the Health Connector?\nDepending on your income, you may qualify for federal and/or state tax credits and other subsidies that reduce your premiums and lower your out-of-pocket expenses if you shop through the Health Connector. You can find out more about the income criteria for qualifying for these subsidies by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 877-MA ENROLL (877-623-6765).",

        "text": "Does access to employer-based health coverage affect my eligibility for subsidized health insurance through the Health Connector?\nAn offer of health coverage from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as the employer, could affect your eligibility for these credits and subsidies through the Health Connector. If your income meets the eligibility criteria, you will qualify for credits and subsidies through the Health Connector if:\n$\\square$ The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not offer coverage to you, or\n- The Commonwealth of Massachusetts offers you coverage, but:\n- The coverage the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides you (not including other family members) would require you to spend more than 9.5 percent of your household income for the year; or\n- The coverage the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides does not meet the \"minimum value\" standard set by the new national health reform law (which says that the plan offered has to cover at least 60 percent of total allowed costs)\n\nIf you purchase a health plan through the Health Connector instead of accepting health coverage offered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts please note that you will lose the employer contribution (if any) for your health insurance. Also, please note that the amount that you and your employer contribute to your employer-sponsored health insurance is often excluded from federal and state income taxes. Health Connector premiums have different tax treatment.\n\nAs part of considering whether the ACA and marketplaces will affect you as an employee it is important to understand what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts offers you.\n\nThe Commonwealth offers benefited employees health coverage through the Group Insurance Commission. To be eligible for GIC health insurance, a state employee must work a minimum of $183 / 4$ hours in a 37.5 hour work week or 20 hours in a 40 hour work week. The employee must contribute to a participating GIC retirement system, such as the State Board of Retirement, a municipal retirement board, the Teachers Retirement Board, the Optional Retirement Pension System for Higher Education, a Housing, Redevelopment Retirement Plan, or another Massachusetts public sector retirement system (OBRA is not such a public retirement system for this purpose). Visit www.mass.gov/gic or see your GIC coordinator for more information.\n- Temporary employees, contractors, less-than-half time part time workers, and most seasonal employees are not eligible for GIC health insurance benefits. These employees may shop for health insurance through the Health Connector and may be eligible for advanced premium federal tax credits and/or state subsidies if their gross family income is at or below $400 \\%$ federal poverty level (which is approximately $\\$ 46,000$ for an individual and $\\$ 94,000$ for a family of four). Visit www.MAhealthconnector.org or call 877-MA-ENROLL for more information.\n\nIf there is any confusion around your employment status and what you are eligible for, please email healthmarketplacenotice@massmail.state.ma.us or contact your HR department or GIC coordinator.",

Reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance after mastectomy\n3. Prosthetics and treatment of physical complications of all stages of mastectomy, including lymphedemas\n\nBenefits for reconstructive breast surgery will be payable on the same basis as any other illness or injury under the Plan, including the application of appropriate deductibles and coinsurance amounts.\n\nSeveral states have enacted similar laws requiring coverage for treatment related to mastectomy. If the law of your state is applicable and is more generous than the federal law, your benefits will be paid in accordance with your state's law.\n\nMinimum Maternity Confinement Benefits\n\nCoverage is provided for inpatient hospital services for a mother and newborn child for a minimum of:\n1. 48 hours following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and\n2. 96 hours following an uncomplicated caesarean section\n\nAny decision to shorten the minimum confinement period will be made by the attending physician in consultation with the mother. If a shortened confinement is elected, coverage will include one home visit for post-delivery care.\n\nHome post-delivery care is defined as health care provided to a woman at her residence by a physician, registered nurse or certified nurse midwife. The health care services provided must include, at a minimum:\n1. Parent education\n2. Assistance and training in breast or bottle feeding, and\n3. Performance of necessary and appropriate clinical tests\n\nAny subsequent home visits must be clinically necessary and provided by a licensed health care provider.\n\nYou must notify the Plan within 24 hours - one business day - of being admitted to the hospital.

        "text": "Appendix E: Your Right to Appeal\n\nThis appendix describes how UniCare handles member appeals in accordance with federal regulations. For purposes of these appeal provisions, \"claim for benefits\" means a request for benefits under the Plan. The term includes both pre-service and post-service claims.\n- A pre-service claim is a claim for benefits under the plan for which you have not received the benefit or for which you may need to obtain approval in advance.\n- A post-service claim is any other claim for benefits under the plan for which you have received the service.\n\nIf your claim is denied or if your coverage is rescinded:\n- You will be provided with a written notice of the denial or rescission; and\n- You are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial or rescission.\n\nA rescission is a retroactive termination of coverage as a result of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of material fact. A cancellation or discontinuance of coverage is not a rescission if the cancellation has a prospective effect or if the cancellation is due to a failure to timely pay required premiums or contributions toward the cost of coverage.\nThe procedure UniCare follows satisfies the requirements for a full and fair review under applicable federal regulations.\n\nNotice of Adverse Benefit Determination\n\nIf your claim is denied, UniCare's notice of the adverse benefit determination (denial) will include the following, when applicable:\n- Information sufficient to identify the claim involved;\n- The specific reasons for the denial;\n- A reference to the plan provisions on which UniCare's determination is based;\n\nA description of any additional material or information needed to reconsider your claim;\n- An explanation of why the additional material or information is needed;\n- A description of the plan's review procedures and the time limits that apply to them;\n- Information about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making the claim determination, and about your right to request a copy of it free of charge;\n- Information about your right to a discussion of the claims denial decision;\n- Information about the scientific or clinical judgment for any determination based on medical necessity or experimental treatment, and about your right to request this explanation free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision; and\n- The availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman who may assist you.",

        "text": "For claims involving urgent/concurrent care:\n- UniCare's notice will also include a description of the applicable urgent/concurrent review process; and\n- UniCare may notify you or your authorized representative within 24 hours orally and then furnish a written notification.\n\nAppeals\n\nYou have the right to appeal an adverse benefit determination. You or your authorized representative must file your appeal within 180 calendar days after you are notified of the denial or rescission. You will have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting your claim. UniCare's review of your claim will take into account all information you submit, regardless of whether it was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.\n\nUniCare shall offer an appeals process and an external review process. In cases involving eligibility for coverage, you may only appeal; there is no external review. The time frame allowed for UniCare to complete its review is dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g., pre-service, concurrent, post-service, urgent, etc.).\n\nFor pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care\n\nYou may obtain an expedited appeal. You or your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including UniCare's decision, can be exchanged by telephone, fax, or other similar method. To file an appeal for a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, you or your authorized representative must contact UniCare at the number shown on your UniCare ID card and provide at least the following information:\n\nThe identity of the claimant;\n$\\square$ The dates of the medical service;\n- The specific medical condition or symptom;\n- The provider's name;\n\nThe service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and\nAny reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis.\n\nAll other requests for appeals\n\nAll other requests for appeals should be submitted in writing by the member or the member's authorized representative, except where the acceptance of oral appeals is otherwise required by the nature of the appeal (e.g., urgent care). You or your authorized representative must submit a request for review to:\n\nUniCare State Indemnity Plan\nP.O. Box 2011\n\nAndover, MA 01810",

In addition, before you receive an adverse benefit determination based on a new or additional rationale, UniCare will provide you with the rationale.\n\nHow Your Appeal Will Be Decided\n\nWhen UniCare considers your appeal, it will not rely upon the initial benefit determination. The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination.\nIf the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether the treatment is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the judgment. This health care professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier determination or who works for one who was consulted in making an earlier determination.\n\nNotification of the Outcome of the Appeal\n\nIf you appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent care\nUniCare will notify you of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of your request for appeal.\n\nIf you appeal any other pre-service claim\n\nUniCare will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal.\n\nIf you appeal a post-service claim\n\nUniCare will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal.\n\nAppeal Denial\n\nIf your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification from UniCare will include all pertinent information set forth in \"Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination\" on page 167.",

You must submit your request for external review to UniCare within four months of the notice of UniCare's adverse determination of your appeal.\n\nA request for an external review must be in writing unless UniCare determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re-send the information that you submitted for your appeal. However, you are encouraged to submit any additional information that you think is important for review.\n\nFor pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may proceed with an expedited external review without filing an appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal. You or your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including UniCare's decision, can be exchanged by telephone, fax, or other similar method.\n\nTo proceed with an expedited external review, you or your authorized representative must contact UniCare at the number shown on your UniCare ID card and provide at least the following information:\n- The identity of the claimant;\n- The dates of the medical service;\n$\\square$ The specific medical condition or symptom;\n- The provider's name;\n\nThe service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and\n- Any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis.\n\nAll other requests for external review should be submitted in writing unless UniCare determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement.
