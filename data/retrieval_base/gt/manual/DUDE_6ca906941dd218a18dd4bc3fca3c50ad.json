This standard is intended to assist in production of quality tiles.\n\nThe clay tiles used for farm drainage purpose are generally of two types: (a) tiles with open joints, and (b) perforated tiles with collar joints. This standard is issued in two parts, Part I covers tiles with open joints and Part II covers requirements of perforated tiles with collar joints.\n\nThis standard was first published in the year 1978. This standard has been revised to incorporate the requirements for the clay tiles joints\n\nFor the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2:1960 'Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised )'. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.",

The strips shall be straight and shall be securely fastened to a rigid base with the interior vertical sides parallel and spaced a distance apart not less than 42 mm nor more than 83 mm per meter of the nominal tile diameter with a minimum spacing of 25 mm ( see Fig. A in 1). Make sure the upper bearing is straight and true from end to end and apply the load through a wood beam or woodenfaced metal beam of such dimensions that it will transmit the full load without appreciable deflection.\n\nA-1.3.3 Upper and lower bearings shall extend full length of tile. Symmetrically place the tile between the two bearings, and center the application of load at the center of the length of tile.\n\nA-1.3.4 Plaster of paris bedding fillets may be used on the lower and upper bearings. Before the tile is placed, cast a fillet of plaster of paris thick enough to compensate for inequalities in the tile barrel on and between the lower bearings and place the tile in position on the fillet while the plaster is still somewhat plastic.

However, if the number of defectives in the samples is greater than the corresponding number, the lot shall be deemed as not having met these requirements.\n\nB-2.2 Warpage\n\nThe lot which has been found satisfactory in respect of visual and dimensional requirements shall then be tested for warpage as given in 7.2 of the specification. Clay tiles for this purpose shall be taken at random from those already selected according to B-2.1 and found satisfactory. The number of tiles to be selected and tested for this purpose shall be according to col 2 of Table 3. Any tile failing in this requirement shall be considered as defective. If the number of defectives in the sample is less than or equal to cosresponding permissible number of defectives given in col 3 of Table of 3, the lot shall be declared as meeting the requirement of warpage; otherwise not.\n\nNOTE - For this purpose the warpage for each individual tile in the sample shall be reported.\n\nB-2.3 Crushing Strength and Water Absorption\n\nThe lot having been found satisfactory in respect of visual, dimensional and warpage shall be finally tested for these requirements as given in the specification.
