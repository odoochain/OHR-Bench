In the effort to fully implement our Positive Behavior Support Program and reduce the loss of instructional time due to out-of-school suspension and expulsion, Crocker Arts and Technology School will utilize a variety of corrective strategies that do not remove children from school.\n\nCorrective Strategies, also known as alternatives to suspension and expulsion, may include but are not limited to:\n$>$ Contact and /or conference with parent /guardian\n$>$ Behavior contracts\n$>$ Behavior Tracking Form\n$>$ Home /school communication\n$>$ Reflective activity\n$>$ Loss of privilege\n> Schedule adjustment\n$>$ Referral to the school social worker\n> In-school detention/supervised work assignment\n$>$ Bus Suspension\n> Classroom Consequences\n$>$ Detention\n\nAt CATS we believe that the discipline policy will insure that our students are educated in a safe, effective learning community. The student Code of Conduct is intended to outline a range of appropriate responses for inappropriate behaviors.\n\nPoor academic achievement is not an act of misconduct. Therefore, the Student Code of Conduct must not be used to discipline students for poor academic achievement or failure to complete assignments. The Student Code of Conduct applies to actions of students during school, on the way to and from school, on school property, on the school bus and at school related activities.\n\nDiscipline incidents will be classified as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 infractions.\n\nInfractions\n\nLevel 1 (minor) Infractions - Discipline incidents that can be handled by the teacher and do not warrant a discipline referral to the office. Any behavior that is of low level intensity, passive in nature and /or of a non-threatening manner is a Level 1 behavior. These behaviors include boarding school bus at incorrect stop, horseplay, violates off-limits/restricted area, habitual tardy and/or absence, skipping class/school, habitual dress code violations, not having proper materials/supplies, and/or equipment for class participation, not participating in class, not dressing out for physical education class, sleeping in class, not having homework or incomplete Homework, making an unfounded charge against authority, using profane and/or obscene Language, refusing to sit in assigned seat, public display of affection (holding hands, kissing, hugging, etc.), talking in class, any other infraction that the principal deems similar in severity to other Level 1 infractions.",

Special education students are subject to the same rules as other students, but with limitations. After the removal of a special education student for more than ten (10) school days (consecutive or cumulative) for any reason, the student must be provided with procedural safeguards. Procedural safeguards are a set of technical state and federal laws that override all other state laws to the contrary. If a student with disability is removed from the student's current educational placement for ten (10) school days in a school year, consecutively or cumulatively, regardless of the circumstances, beginning on the eleventh (11th) school day, all students must be offered education services, including access to the general curriculum; implementation of the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP), access to statewide test/LEAP 21, preparation and/or remediation equal to those services provided to general education students, and services and modifications designed to prevent the behavior from recurring if the behavior involves drugs, weapons or behavior substantially likely to cause injury to the student or others.\n\nThe following policy and procedures may be altered to insure individualization of programming as required by federal mandate.\n\nSUSPENSION\n\nAfter the first suspension a conference with parent or legal guardian will be held to develop a Functional Behavior Assessment and develop and implement an individual Behavior Intervention Plan to address the behavior that resulted in suspension. After the second suspension, the IEP team will reconvene to discuss/review the academic, social, and behavioral needs of the student, develop a Functional Behavior Assessment and develop/implement an individual Behavior Intervention Plan. This will occur only if the behavior exhibited is a new behavior. If the behavior is a repeated behavior, the Behavior Intervention Plan will be reviewed to address the suspendable behavior and to discuss, review, and revise the Individualized Education Plan, as needed, to address the behavior resulting in the suspension. After the third and subsequent suspensions, the Manifestation Determination Review (MDR) Committee will convene and conduct a review to determine whether the behavior is related or not related to the student's disability. At least one person on the committee must know the student and one other must be knowledgeable of the student's disability. The parent or legal guardian must be notified of the review and every effort must be made to have the parent or legal guardian participate in the decision. If the parent or legal guardian does not participate, documentation of such must be included.\n\nEXPULSION (LEVEL 3 INFRACTIONS/NOT-RELATED)\n\nA student may be recommended for expulsion when a LEVEL 3 Infraction occurs.

R.S. 14:37). A dangerous weapon includes any gas, liquid, or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.[La. R.S. 14:2 (A)(3)]. Battery - the unlawful beating or other use of violent force on another person.\nBehavior Contract - an agreement between the child and teacher and, often, the student's parent(s). The behavior contract is a written agreement that indicates how the individual will behave, the appropriate consequence should the student not behave according to the contract, and the reinforcement(s) to be utilized for\nsuccessful compliance. The behavior contract is intended to provide the student with structure and self-management.\nBehavior Intervention Plan (BIP) - a plan that is the result of a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA). Behavior Intervention Plans are written documents that describe the inappropriate behavior to be changed as well as strategies or interventions implemented to address the target behavior. Behavior Intervention\nPlans are developed by either the classroom teacher or a team of school personnel who assist the teacher in proactively, consistently, and effectively addressing inappropriate behavior. Behavior Intervention Plans aid in communicating behavioral expectations to individual students or an entire classroom and also communicate the consequences of achieving the goal or objective. In addition, Behavior Intervention Plans allow frequent feedback regarding the effectiveness of the management strategies being employed, assist in documentation of student or class progress and provide useful guidelines for interacting with students.\nBullying - the act of intentionally causing harm to others through verbal or physical threats and/or demands with regard to race, color, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or any other distinguishing characteristics that adversely affect the ability of a student to participate in or benefit from the school's educational programs or activities by placing the student in reasonable fear of physical harm.\nBurglary - the act of entering a building or other premises with the intent to steal.\nChange of Placement - occurs when either the school removes the student from his or her educational placement for more than ten (10) consecutive school days or the school removes the student from his or her educational placement on several occasions that constitute a pattern and add up to more than ten (10) school days.\nCharter School - an independent school that is publicly funded. Under Louisiana law, private groups may apply for a charter, which allows them to operate an independent school using public money. There are various types of charter schools. Some are chartered by the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE), while others are chartered either by the Orleans Parish School Board or the Recovery School District. Charter schools MUST follow the same state law regarding discipline and the same state and federal law regarding special education. Check-In/Check-Out (CICO) - a positive behavioral support for students who demonstrate moderate behavior problems. It is intended to provide frequent reinforcement for compliance with behavioral goals. Each of the behavioral goals should be defined in clear behavioral terms.",

Detention is usually considered one of the milder forms of disciplinary action available to a school.\nDiscipline - the steps, action, or training that teachers, administrators, support staff, and parents implement to enhance student academic, social, moral, or mental improvement.\nDue Process Hearing - a formal hearing to resolve special education disputes between parents and schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act includes rules of procedure for resolving such disputes. These rules include mediation, due process hearings and appeals to state or federal court. A due process hearing is usually a formal, contested trial. Exceptionality - a student's special learning need identified through the Multi-Disciplinary Evaluation process. There are several types of exceptionalities, including Autism/Asperger's Syndrome, Emotional Disturbance, Gifted and Talented, Specific Learning Disability and Mental Disability.

The school must create a specific plan to address the child's learning needs, place them in the appropriate educational setting for their needs, and deliver special education and related services required for the child to learn. FAPE differs for each student and ensures that all students with disabilities receive an appropriate public education at no expense to the family.\nFunctional Behavior Assessment (FBA) - a process of examining the function that a particular behavior serves for a student that includes an analysis of the frequency, intensity and duration of a behavior. The end result of the FBA is a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP). A Behavior Intervention Plan is used to implement interventions for the specific behaviors as identified.

A re-evaluation is conducted to 1) identify how the student is functioning in school, 2) identify the student's educational needs, and 3) identify any changes in the\nstudent's IEP to assist in meeting the annual goals and objectives included in the IEP and participating, as appropriate, in the general curriculum.\nReflective Activity - an assignment designed to give the student an opportunity to think critically about an instance in which he/she broke a rule. The assignment should guide the student towards determining an appropriate behavior for the given situation instead of the behavior that broke a school rule.\nRelated Services - developmental, corrective, and other supportive services that assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education. Related services include: speech-language pathology and audiology services; psychological services; physical and occupational therapy; recreation, including therapeutic recreation; early identification and assessment of disabilities in children; counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling; orientation and mobility services; medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes; school health services; social work services in schools; parent counseling and training; and transportation.\nResponse to Intervention (RTI) - a process that provides high-quality research-based instruction and interventions that are matched to a student's needs. This process incorporates data developed to examine the student's learning rate over time to make appropriate educational and instructional decisions regarding assistance to at-risk students. In the RTI process, students with academic delays and/or behavioral deficits are given one or more research-validated interventions. The student's academic and behavior progress is monitored frequently to see if the interventions are sufficient to assist the student in reaching the instructional level of his or her grade. If collected data indicates that the student does not demonstrate adequate progress despite several implemented research based interventions, consideration for special education may be warranted.\nRobbery - an act or instance of illegally taking another's property by the use of intimidation or violence.",
