        "text": "George Brown and Toronto have been growing together for 16 years. The College was created in 1968 as the City's official community college, and was named after one of Toronto's most famous citizens of the last century. George Brown (1819-1880) was a Father of Confederation and founder of the Globe newspaper - forerunner of today's Globe and Mail.\n\nSince its first day, the College has grown both in student enrolment and the variety of programs it offers.\n\nToday, George Brown has 10,000 full-time students in 150 programs in technology, business, health, hospitality and applied arts, and a faculty of 700 .\n\nThroughout its rapid expansion, the College has maintained one goal - to provide high quality, joboriented education that benefits both its students and the community.\n\nStudents are drawn to the College from across Canada and around the world by the excellence of its programs and its unique location.\n\nOur location in the heart of Toronto adds an extra dimension to student life - both on and off campus.\nIn the classroom, students benefit from the advice we get from our downtown neighbours - the leaders in their fields. Their advice helps us ensure that our programs are up-to-date and meet the needs of industry.\n\nThe city also gives our students the chance to join the working world before graduation. Many programs include on-the-job training, and opportunities for parttime and summer work are plentiful.\nOut of class, George Brown students have the run of the city. Restaurants, movies, fashion, sports, art and theatre all flourish in the streets around our campuses.\n\nToronto offers an exceptional variety of social, recreational and cultural experiences that make college a time of personal growth.\n\nThis folder will tell you more about life at George Brown - our campuses, faculty, services and activities.
