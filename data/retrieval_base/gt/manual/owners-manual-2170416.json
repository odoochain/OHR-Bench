Because the sounds are new to you, you might be concerned about them. Don't be. Most of the new sounds are normal. Hard surfaces like the floor, walls, and cabinets can make the sounds seem louder.\nThe following describes the kinds of sounds that might be new to you, and what may be making them.\n\nSlight hum, soft hiss\nYou may hear the refrigerator's fan motor and moving air.\n\nClicking or snapping sounds\nThe thermostat makes a definite click when the refrigerator stops running. It also makes a sound when the refrigerator starts. The defrost timer will click when the defrost cycle starts.\n\nWater sounds\nWhen the refrigerator stops running, you may hear gurgling in the tubing for a few minutes after it stops. You may also hear defrost water running into the defrost water pan.\nIce maker sounds\n- trickling water\n- thud (clatter of ice)\n\nYou may hear buzzing (from the water valve), trickling water, and the clatter of ice dumped into the bin.\n\nRunning sounds\nYour refrigerator has a high-efficiency compressor and motor. It will run longer than older designs. It may even seem to run most of the time.\n\nSaving energy\nYou can help your refrigerator use less electricity.\n- Check door gaskets for a tight seal. Level the cabinet to be sure of a good seal.\n- Clean the condenser coils regularly.\n- Open the door as few times as possible. Think about what you need before you open the door. Get everything out at one time. Keep food organized so you won't have to search for what you want. Close door as soon as food is removed.\n20\n- Go ahead and fill up the refrigerator, but don't overcrowd it so air movement is blocked.\n- It is a waste of electricity to set the refrigerator and freezer to temperatures colder than they need to be. If ice cream is firm in the freezer and drinks are as cold as your family likes them, that's cold enough.\n- Make sure your refrigerator is not next to a heat source such as a range, water heater, furnace, radiator, or in direct sunlight.",

Tape rubber or wood blocks to the tops of both doors to prop them open far enough for air to get in. This stops odor and mold from building up.\n\nAWARNING\n\nPersonal Injury Hazard\n\nDo not allow children to climb on, play near, or climb inside the refrigerator when the doors are blocked open. They may become injured or trapped.\n\nTo restart refrigerator, see \"Using Your Refrigerator\" on page 8.\n\nMoving\n\nWhen you are moving the refrigerator to a new home:\n1. Turn off the water supply to the ice maker at least one day ahead of time.\n2. Disconnect the water line.\n3. After the last load of ice drops, lift the signal arm to the OFF (up) position.\n4. Remove all food from the refrigerator.\n5. Pack all frozen food in dry ice.\n6. Unplug the refrigerator.\n7. Clean it thoroughly. Rinse well and dry.\n8. Take out all removable parts, wrap them well, and tape them together so they don't shift and rattle.\n9. Screw in the leveling rollers.\n10. Tape the doors shut and tape the power supply cord to the cabinet.\nWhen you get to your new home, put everything back and refer to page 6. Also, remember to reconnect the water supply line.\n\n\nPower interruptions\n\n\nIf electricity goes off, call the power company. Ask how long power will be off.\n1. If service will be interrupted 24 hours or less, keep both doors closed. This helps foods stay frozen.\n2. If service will be interrupted longer than 24 hours:\n(a) Remove all frozen food and store in a frozen food locker.\nOR\n(b) Place 32 grams of dry ice in freezer for every liter ( 2 lbs. for every cubic foot) of freezer space. This will keep food frozen for 2 to 4 days. Wear gloves to protect your hands from dry ice burns.\n\nOR\n(c) If neither a food locker or dry ice is available, use or can perishable food at once.\n3. A full freezer stays cold longer than a partly filled one. A freezer full of meat stays cold longer than a freezer full of baked goods. If food contains ice crystals, it may be safely refrozen, although the quality and flavor may be affected. If the condition of the food is poor, or if you feel it is unsafe, dispose of it.",

        "text": "Food Storage Guide\n\n\nThere is a correct way to package and store refrigerated or frozen food. To keep food fresher, longer, take the time to study these recommended steps.\n\nStoring fresh food\n\nWrap or store food in the refrigerator in air-tight and moisture-proof material. This prevents food odor and taste transfer throughout the refrigerator. For dated products, check code date to ensure freshness.\n\nLeafy vegetables\n\nRemove store wrapping and trim or tear off bruised and discolored areas. Wash in cold water and drain. Place in plastic bag or plastic container and store in crisper.\n\nVegetables with skins (carrots, peppers)\n\nStore in crisper, plastic bags, or plastic container.\n\nFruit\n\nWash, let dry, and store in refrigerator in plastic bags or crisper. Do not wash or hull berries until they are ready to use. Sort and keep berries in their original container in a crisper, or store in a loosely closed paper bag on a refrigerator shelf.\n\nEggs\n\nStore without washing in the original carton on interior shelf.\n\nMilk\n\nWipe milk cartons. For best storage, place milk on interior shelf.\n\nButter or margarine\n\nKeep opened butter in covered dish or closed compartment. When storing an extra supply, wrap in freezer packaging and freeze.\n\nCheese\n\nStore in the original wrapping until you are ready to use it. Once opened, rewrap tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.\n\nLeftovers\n\nCover leftovers with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Plastic containers with tight lids can also be used.\n\nMeat\n\nStore most meat in original wrapping as long as it is airtight and moisture-proof. Rewrap if necessary. See the following chart for storage times.\n\\begin{tabular}{|lc|}\n  TYPE & APPROXIMATE TIME (DAYS) \\\\\n  Chicken & 1 to 2 \\\\\n  Ground beef & 1 to 2 \\\\\n  Steaks and roasts & 3 to 5 \\\\\n  Cured meats & 7 to 10 \\\\\n  Bacon & 5 to 7 \\\\\n  Cold cuts & 3 to 5 \\\\\n  Variety meats & 1 to 2 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n+ When storing meat longer than the times given, follow the directions for freezing.\nNOTE: Use fresh fish and shellfish the same day as purchased.",

        "text": "Storing frozen food\n\nThe freezer section is designed for storage of commercially frozen food and for freezing food at home.\nNOTE: For further information about preparing food for freezing or food storage times, check a freezer guide or reliable cookbook.\n\nPackaging\n\nThe secret of successful freezing is in the packaging. The way you close and seal the package must not allow air or moisture in or out. Packaging done in any other way could cause food odor and taste transfer throughout the refrigerator and drying of frozen food.\n\nPackaging recommended for use:\n- Rigid plastic containers with tight-fitting lids\n- Straight-sided canning/freezing jars\n- Heavy-duty aluminum foil\n- Plastic-coated paper\n- Non-permeable plastic wraps (made from a saran film)\nFollow package or container instructions for proper freezing methods.\n\nDo not use:\n- Bread wrappers\n- Non-polyethylene plastic containers\n- Containers without tight lids\n- Wax paper\n- Wax-coated freezer wrap\n- Thin, semi-permeable wrap\n\nThe use of these wrappings could cause food odor, taste transfer, and drying of frozen food.\n\nFreezing\n\nDo not expect your freezer to quick-freeze any large quantity of food. Put no more unfrozen food into the freezer than will freeze within 24 hours (no more than 32 to 48 grams of food per liter [ 2 to 3 lbs. per cubic foot] of freezer space). Leave enough space for air to circulate around packages. Be careful to leave enough room at the front so the door can close tightly.\n\nStorage times will vary according to the quality of the food, the type of packaging or wrap used (airtight and moisture-proof), and the storage temperature, which should be $-17.8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\left(0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\right)$.",

Open the freezer door and lift it up off lower hinge. Be careful not to damage the water line.\n4. Carefully set the freezer door to one side. Be careful not to kink the water line hose.\n5. Now, remove the refrigerator door. Pry off the hinge cover, starting at the back of it. Hold the door while you remove the three screws that hold the top hinge and shim. Save the nylon spacer. Lift the door up off the bottom hinge and carefully set it aside.\nNOTE: On some models, the top hinge is permanently attached to the inside of the door and must not be removed.\nTo reinstall the doors:\n1. With the freezer door held upright next to its hinge, feed the water line carefully through the hinge hole. Lower the door onto the bottom hinge while pulling the remaining water line through the bottom. Close the door.\n2. While the freezer door is still held in place, reinsert the three screws to reattach the top hinge to the cabinet. Reconnect the electrical wires at the top. (See figure 3.)\n3. Reconnect the water line. Replace the protective spring, nut, and \" O \" rings. Tighten the union. (Must be water tight.)\n4. Reattach the refrigerator door. Lift refrigerator door onto bottom hinge pin. While holding the door in the closed position, reinstall the top hinge.\n\nFREEZER DOOR ELECTRICAL PLUG\n5. Align the doors and adjust the door seal. Loosen the top hinge screws and line up the doors so they are parallel with the sides of the cabinet and with each other.\nTo adjust the door seal, move the top hinges slightly and add shims to the bottom hinge as required. Make sure the water line and electrical wire are not interfered with.\n6. Check the alignment by plugging in the refrigerator to make sure the lights go out as the doors close.\nWhen the doors are aligned properly, retighten all hinge screws securely and replace the hinge covers. (Replace the screw on the freezer hinge cover.) Reattach the door shelves and compartments.\nDo not replace the base grille until the water line is hooked up. Check the union for leakage when water is flushed through the cold water tank. Tighten the connection if needed.\n27",
