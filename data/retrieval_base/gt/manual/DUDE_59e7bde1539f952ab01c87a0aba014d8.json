In planning any new farm building, you'll find a Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Farm Design gives you unmatched advantages in design, durability, adaptability, economy and simplicity of construction-as well as in appearance.\n\nand Equipment\n\n\nTHESE TAILOR-MADE DESIGNS MEET THE NEEDS OF TODAY-AND TOMORROW!\n\n\nBoth the portable and colony type hog houses included in this book have been engineered for tight, weatherproof construction to assure the warmth, dryness, sunlight, and ventilation baby pigs require. In the larger houses, interior space is held down to preserve animal heat without sacrificing head room or floor area. There is ample light, yet windows are kept to a minimum to reduce heat loss. All the houses are designed to fit in well with existing farm buildings and to give the same advantages in durability and easy maintenance common to all lumber buildings on the farm.\n\nThe portable houses, designed for use with the popular Clean Range Sanitary System, include sectional floor panels that can be removed and cleaned easily. There are many instances where soil drainage and ground conditions make this added feature desirable. If you choose a colony house, you should include a tightly fenced, easily cleaned concrete feeding and exercise platform. With the colony house, the sow and her litter can be moved to clean pasture if you provide range shelters. Or you can remove the sows at weaning time and confine the pigs to the house.\nYou'll tind Weyerhaeuser-designed Hog Houses and equipment items ease chores and save time, whether hogs are a sideline or major part of your farm operation.\n\nPlans, specifications, and material lists for these and many other farm buildings available at your lumber dealer . . .\n\nINDEX\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{HOG HOUSES} \\\\\n  Plan No. & TITLE & Page \\\\\n1302-a & A-Type 1-Pen Hog House & 4 \\\\\n1303-d & 4-Pen U.M.U.

Both sections are portable, mounted on skids, and will pass through a 10' gate. Pens are at least 6' x 8'. Floors are optional. The building is of sturdy, permanent structure and sturdily braced to withstand moving. Eight foot height at ridge gives ample head room. Cello-glass windows are located at each end of each section and pig doors open below the windows. Entrance door opens to a 2'-10\" alleyway and there is space over pens for storage.\n\n\nGROWING AND FINISHING HOUSE\n\nNO. 1376\n\nSize: 18' x 64'\n\nTapered timber design provides for fast, easy construction and long life. Smooth interiors permit easy cleaning, assure good sanitation, and prevention of injury to animals. Open front saves cost, wide roof overhang gives extra shade. Removable hinged front gates, swing-up center gate gives easy access for tractor cleaning. Ventilation along entire length of rear wall gives added summer ventilation.

The concrete floor and spray eliminate the hog wallow and aid in making better feed conversion especially where heat is a factor. Side walls can be opened or shut for ventilation or protection from the weather. The shelter can be increased in units of 10 feet. Self feeding equipment for this post-free shelter can be made from other plans available from your Weyerhaeuser dealer.",
