The narrowing or blockage can lead to decreased blood flow to the heart muscle (angina). Prolonged reduced blood flow can cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI). Because CAD is the leading cause of death in men, it is important to understand what causes this condition and how it is treated.\n\nCAUSES\n\nAtherosclerosis is the cause of CAD. This is the buildup of fat and cholesterol (plaque) on the inside of the arteries. Over time, the plaque may narrow or block the artery, and this will lessen blood flow to the heart. Plaque can also become weak and break off within a coronary artery to form a clot and cause a sudden blockage.\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nMany risk factors increase your chances of getting CAD, including:\n- High cholesterol levels.\n- High blood pressure (hyperterision).\n- Tobacco use.\n- Diabetes.\n- Age. Men over age 45 are at a greater risk of CAD.\n- Gender. Men often develop CAD earlier in life than women.\n- Family history of CAD.\n- Obesity.\n- Lack of exercise.\n- A diet high in saturated fats.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nMany people do not experience any symptoms during the early stages of CAD.

This looks for signs of blockage when the heart is being exercised.\n- Pharmacologic stress test. This test looks for signs of blockage when the heart is being stressed with a medicine.\n- Blood tests.\n- Coronary angiogram. This is a procedure to look at the coronary arteries to see if there is any blockage.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe treatment of CAD may include the following:\n- Healthy behavioral changes to reduce or control risk factors.\n- Medicine.\n- Coronary stenting. A stent helps to keep an artery open.\n- Coronary angioplasty. This procedure widens a narrowed or blocked artery.\n- Coronary artery bypass surgery. This will allow your blood to pass the blockage (bypass) to reach your heart.\n\nHOME CARE INSTRUCTIONS\n- Take medicines only as directed by your health care provider.\n- Do not take the following medicines unless your health care provider approves:\n- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAlDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or celecoxib.\n- Vitamin supplements that contain vitamin A, vitamin E, or both.\n- Manage other health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes as directed by your health care provider.",
