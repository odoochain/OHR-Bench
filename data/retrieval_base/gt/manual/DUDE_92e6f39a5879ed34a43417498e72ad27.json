The standard has been revised again to incorporate certain improvements found necessary in the light of the modifications suggested by the testing authorities and the manufacturers. The revised version incorporates, among others, the following:\na) Amendments No. 1 and 2 issued to earlier version of this standard;\nb) Editorial changes including updating of referred standards;\nc) Material of construction are modified and chemical composition of brass casting components as per their relevent Indian Standard is to ensure conformity;\nd) Requirements of spray lance, cut off device, spray nozzle and spray gun and their method of test which were earlier covered in separate specifications, i.e., IS $7417: 1982$, IS $7458: 1982$, IS $7515: 1982$. IS 10064: 1982. IS 10093: 1982, IS 10107:1982 and IS 11776:1986 are now covered in this standard. With the publication of this standard these standards will be withdrawn;\ne) Test for piston made of synthetic rubber; and\nf) Provision of supplying a spray gun and adjustable nozzle.\n\nThe figures given in the standard are meant only for illustration of the components. These should not be considered as suggestive of any standard design.\nFor the guidance of the purchaser, information to be supplied if quoted to the manufacturer is given in Annex A.\nFor the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2: 1960'Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)'. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.",
