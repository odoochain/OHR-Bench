Here in this book are Weyerhaeuser Farm Designs for the kind of buildings and equipmentfrom greenhouses to bridges - that keep farming a way of life rather than just a job. There are many workshop plans . . . many handy household items that help lighten the farm wife's work . . . post-free buildings in various sizes to house special projects or hobbies. Practically every plan represents a good $4-\\mathrm{H}$ or FFA project: a project that will help youngsters perfect their basic carpentry skills and at the same time result in something that is lastingly useful-a real addition to the farm.\n\nThe utility buildings, in every case, are carefully engineered to give year after year of service. They are structurally sound, able to withstand severe storms . . . and they are easily adapted to a wide variety of uses so that your investment in them is well protected. If you need extra space right now, why not map out your present farm buildings on a piece of graph paper and see how conveniently a new multi-use utility building will fit in.\n\nPlans, specifications, and material lists for these and many other farm buildings available at your lumber dealer\n\n\nGENERAL UTILITY FARM STRUCTURES\nPlan No: Title: Page:\n\n1501 Sheep Barn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\n3216 Pole-Type Shelter. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\n\n\n1201 Two-Stall Stable. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\n1202 Four-Stall Stable.......................... . . . . 4\n\n\n3210 One-Lane Farm Bridge........................ . . . 5\n3215 Foot Bridge. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\n4101 Bunkhouse for Seasonal Labor. ......... . . . 5\n\n3217 Lumber Storage Shed...................... . . . 5\n\n3601 Insulated Greenhouse . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n\n3602 Market Stand. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n\n3603 Market Stand. . . ...................................... 6\n\n3604 Market Stand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n\n3213 One Story Arched Roof Utility Building... 7\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nFeeding Trough for Sheep - Portable Hay and Grain Rack for Sheep-Chopped Hay Rack for Sheep-SelfClosing Gate-Saddle Cleaning Rack-A-Type Hurdle Etc.\nIllustrations and Descriptions.\n8-11\n\nDrawings. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12-23\n\nEquipment Material Lists . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24-27\n\n\n\nWeyerhaeuser \\\\ 4-SQUARE \\\\ LUMBER DEALER For Plans and Material Lists\n\n\n\nYour local Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Lumber Dealer will be glad to go over blueprints and material lists with you, answer any questions you may have, and help you plan a building program that will fit in with your farm operation.",
