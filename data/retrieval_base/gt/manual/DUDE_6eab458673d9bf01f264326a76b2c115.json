Students are still required to meet the other requirements.\n\nMAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY\n- To receive the benefits of the Millennium Scholarship Program, you must enroll in an eligible institution of higher education in Nevada.\n- It is important to remember receiving a Millennium Scholarship does not guarantee your admission to any institution.\n\nAfter your admission to an eligible institution, you must meet the following requirements to receive and maintain the benefits of the scholarship:\n- Enroll each semester in a minimum of 9 credits at a NSHE community college or 12 credits at any other eligible institutions.\n- You must enroll in a program of study leading to a recognized associate degree, baccalaureate degree, or pre-baccalaureate certificate.\n- You must maintain a 2.60 semester GPA for each semester until you complete a total of 30 credits. Starting in the semester in which you earn 30 or more credits, you must maintain a 2.75 GPA each semester you receive Millennium funds.\n\n\nIf you fail to meet the minimum requirements in any semester in which you receive funding, you will receive a strike and your scholarship will be suspended. Eligibility for the Millennium Scholarship can be regained only once by meeting all of the requirements listed above in a subsequent semester. Loss of eligibility a second time will permanently remove you from the program.",

        "text": "1. What is the dollar value of the scholarship?\n\nThe Millennium Scholarship is a maximum $\\$ 10,000$ award paid on a per-credit hour basis, up to 15 credits each semester. Millennium Scholars at a NSHE community college will receive $\\$ 40$ per credit hour. Students at a NSHE state college will receive \\$60 per credit hour. Millennium Scholars at all other eligible institutions will receive \\$80 per enrolled credit hour.\n\n2. Will the Millennium Scholarship pay for all my classes?\n\nThe Millennium Scholarship will NOT pay for remedial or graduate courses. NSHE defines remedial as any class with a course number less than 100.\n\n3. Do I have to notify the Millennium Scholarship Office if I switch institutions?\n\nNo, you don't have to notify our office that you are changing schools. However, please make sure you declare a major at your new institution and follow up with the financial aid office.\n\n4. What do I have to do if I'm taking classes at two eligible institutions?\n\nIf you are enrolled at two institutions and wish to receive funds at both institutions, you must submit a \"Co-Enrollment Form\" which can be found at nvggms.gov under \"Forms and Documents\". A co-enrolled student must be enrolled in at least 12 credits between both institutions and may only be funded for a total of 15 credits. Credits taken at the host institution must meet degree requirements at student's home institution.\n\n5. Can I use my Millennium Scholarship funds for books or other educational purposes?\n\nYes, but only under certain circumstances. If you are receiving other financial aid, your institution may provide the remaining value of your Millennium Scholarship award in a residual check. These funds may be used for other educational purposes such as registration fees, required textbooks, and other costs related to attendance at your eligible institution.\n\n6. Will I lose my scholarship if I drop one of my classes?\n\nAny semester, in which you receive funding from the scholarship, you must always finish the term meeting all the minimum requirements. For example, if you are at a university and drop to 9 credits, you will lose your scholarship. At a community college, if you drop to 9 credits you are still meeting the minimum requirements for that institution, so you wouldn't lose your scholarship.\n\nISSUES \\\\ ANSWERS\n\nIf you want to know your MSID number\n\nIf you could not find your name in the lookup tool\n\nIf you acknowledged your award, but your status still says \"ineligible\"\n\nIf you acknowledged your award but haven't received any funds\n\nUse the lookup tool at nvggms.gov\n\nGive us a call at (702) 486-3383.\n\nWait 3 days for your status to change.\n\nContact the Financial Aid office at your institution.\n\nCollege of Southern Nevada (702) 651-4047 financial aid_ www.csn.edu\n\nGreat Basin College\n(775) 753-2399 financial aid www.gbenv.edu\n\nNevada State College (702) 992-2150 financial aid www.nsc.edu\n\nRoseman University of Health Sciences (702) 968-2004 financial aid www.roseman.edu\n\nSierra Nevada College (775) 831-1314 financial aid www.sierranevada.edu\n\nTruckee Meadows Community College\n(775) 673-7072 financial aid www.tmcc.edu\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas\n(702) 895-3424 financial aid www.unlv.edu\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno (775) 784-4666 financial aid www.unr.edu\n\nWestern Nevada College (775) 445-3264 financial aid www.wnc.edu\n\nLEGפSLATפVE CHANGES\n\nIn 2015, the Legislature passed SB 128 which increased the number of credit hours required for certain students to be eligible for the Millennium Scholarship.\nTo be eligible to receive funds, students must be enrolled in at least nine semester credit hours at a community college.\nThis bill also allows students to receive funds up to a maximum of 15 credits at all institutions.\n\nMillennium Scholarship Contact Information\n\nOffice of the State Treasurer\n555 E.
