        "text": "1. Insert plug into 110 volt $A C$ outlet and actuate switch.\n2. Turn adjusting screw clockwise to separate stripping brushes.\n3. Take a sample of the wire to be stripped in the right hand and insert it between the brushes.\n4. Slowly turn the brush gap adjusting screw counter clockwise with the left hand while moving the sample wire in and out with the right hand.\n\nNOTE: As the brushes approach the correct setting a slight pull will be felt on the wire. Further adjustment for brush pressure is provided and the two should be co-ordinated for best results (see below).\n5. This unit has a unique telescoping screw design which maintains wheel pressure once it has been set by the operator, even though the space between the wheels is changed. With former wheel type units it was necessary for the operator or setup man to reset the wheel pressure whenever the wheels were moved. Excessive pressure tends to clog the wheels and damage the conductor, and too little pressure results in incomplete or slow stripping.\n\nAdjustment is made by turning the large knurled nut clockwise, to increase gap between the brushes and counter clockwise to decrease gap. The smallest of the two adjustment nuts, located on top of the brush gap adjustment nut, is used to vary the pressure exerted on the wire by the brushes. This can be increased by turning knob clockwise, and decreased by turning counter clockwise.\n\nBrush pressure and gap will be governed by the size and type of insulation being stripped, and adjustment can be satisfactorily made to strip wire as small as 47 gauge without breakage. This is the main purpose of this provision, to provide an infinite adjustment that will prevent smallest wire size breakage, and increased effectiveness of the unit on all sizes, with a minimum amount of brush wear.\n\nDRESSING INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Actuate switch. Then separate brushes approximately $1 / 8^{\\prime \\prime}$ by turning the adjusting screw clockwise.\n2. Insert wheel dresser between brushes with the right hand.\n3. Slowly bring wheels to bear on dresser by turning the adjusting screw with the left hand counter clockwise and working dresser in a circular motion, using brush pressure adjustment needed.\n\nREPLACING BRUSHES\n1. Remove brush cover.\n2. Separate brushes by turning the adjusting screw clockwise.\n3. Remove the brush. Hold down nuts by turning the upper nut clockwise and the lower nut counter clockwise.\n4. Remove brushes.",
