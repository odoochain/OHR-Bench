They are mainly used for transporting farm produce but often they are also popular especially in the rural areas as the means of passenger transport. Although initially such carts were assembled by village craftsmen, lately the production of such carts is fast getting organized and the assembly of the same is taken care of by technically trained manpower. A need, therefore, was felt to formulate an Indian Standard for such carts mainly with a view to reduce variety, achieve rationalization and promote interchangeability.\n\nIn the preparation of this standard, assistance has been obtained from Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Bhopal\n\nFor the purpose of deciding whelher a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960 'Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)'. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard",
