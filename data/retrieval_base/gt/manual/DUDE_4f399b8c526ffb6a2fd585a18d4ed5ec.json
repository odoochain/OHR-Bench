The student will understand that an armed private security officer possesses no law enforcement powers, and is considered a private citizen with no duty to act when confronted by unlawful behavior. The student will understand how to avoid becoming the aggressor. The student will also understand the criminal and civil penalties associated with the misuse of deadly force.\n\nOREGON LAW\n\nOregon law allows a private citizen to use force in self defense or the defense of another person. Oregon law considers the armed private security officer to be a private citizen, and therefore subject to the same limitations on the use of force, both physical and deadly. It is necessary for the armed private security professional to possess a fundamental knowledge of Oregon law concerning the use of force by private persons. Under Oregon law the armed private security officer is NEVER REQUIRED to use force.\n\nDefinitions\n\nDeadly Physical Force means physical force that under the circumstances in which it is used is readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury. ORS 161.015(3)\n\nSerious Physical Injury means physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death. ORS 161.015(8)\n\nReasonably believes... means that the person carrying out the force is acting on knowledge that he or she believes at that time to be true, and that an ordinary and reasonable person (i.e. a juror) would also believe to be true under the circumstances.\n\nStatutes\n\nAn armed private security officer may be justified in using physical force during the confrontation or apprehension of a suspect, or in responding to an attack. Oregon law allows the use of necessary physical force in such circumstances, but",

Except as provided in ORS 161.215 and ORS 161.219, a person is justified in using physical force upon another person for self defense or to defend a third person from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.\n\nWhat does ORS 161.209 mean?\n\nIt means that a private citizen can use reasonable physical force (less than deadly force) to defend him or herself from an attacker who is using physical force.\n1. Physical force is force that is not likely to result in death or serious physical injury. Generally this would mean an attack with empty hands or no weapons involved.\n2. The private citizen or armed private security officer could respond by using reasonable force such as defensive tactics controls, a chemical weapon like CapStun ${ }^{T M}$, an electronic weapon or stun gun, or a baton.\n3. Physical force is also reasonable if it is the minimum degree of force necessary to cause the threat to stop the attack or be placed under physical control.\n\nIt is very important to understand that Oregon law \\\\ places restrictions on the use of DEADLY PHYSICAL FORCE\n\nORS 161.219(3) states that a person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person unless the person reasonably believes that the other person is using or about to use deadly physical force against a person.\n\nWhat does ORS 161.219(3) mean?",

It means that you must base your belief on the knowledge you possess at the time of the attack, and that such knowledge would lead a reasonable person to the same conclusion.\n3. It means that your use of deadly force is justified only as long as the attacker is using or about to use deadly force against you. Once the attacker stops using deadly force, you must stop using deadly force.\n\nDPSST recommends that private security officers use deadly physical force only:\n1. In defense of the officer's own life (to prevent someone from causing death or serious physical injury to the officer.)\n2. In the defense of another person's life (to prevent someone from seriously injuring or killing another person in the officer's presence.\n\nIt is very important to understand that deadly physical force (using a firearm or other deadly weapon) is NOT justified to stop a suspect who is running away from you, attempting to steal or destroy property, or disobeying an order.\n\nBecoming the Aggressor\n\nYou become the aggressor when you use force that is not justified in the first place, or after there is no longer a need to use previously justifiable force. Oregon law provides no defense or justification for the use of force by the aggressor.\n\nORS 161.215 states that a person is not justified in using physical force in self defense if:\n\nThe person using the force provokes the use of unlawful physical force by another person with the intent to cause death or physical injury to that person; or",

At that point the private security officer is using force unlawfully and has become the AGGRESSOR.\n\nBeing the AGGRESSOR means using EXCESSIVE or UNJUSTIFIED FORCE.\n\nHow Do You Avoid Using Excessive or Unjustified Force?\n\nThe armed private security officer can avoid becoming the aggressor in a use of force situation by:\n1. Knowing when it is lawful and proper to use force.\n2. Considering and, if possible, using alternatives to the use of force.\n3. Using only the degree of force necessary to stop the attack or control the threat.\n4. Reducing the level of force if the threat stops using force, retreats or surrenders.\n5.

        "text": "The Determination of Force Matrix\n\nThe Determination of Force Matrix is a conceptual model that helps private security officers understand what the proper level of force or alternate action should be in response to an attack or in trying to overcome resistance. It is also helpful in avoiding becoming the aggressor.\n\nThe Determination of Force Matrix is often expressed as a chart that shows the level of resistance by the threat, from low to high, and the corresponding level of appropriate force or action by the officer. At the lowest level of resistance the threat may refuse to comply or offer verbal resistance. The officer would reasonably respond by calmly talking to the threat, getting information, asking the threat to comply, providing choices, and calling for assistance.\n\nMaybe the threat resists by punching, kicking or attempting to escape. The officer could reasonably defend him or herself by using non-lethal techniques: restraining techniques, pepper spray or impact weapons. If the threat's resistance is lethal (uses a firearm or other lethal weapon like a knife or club, uses a non-lethal weapon or any object in a lethal manner, or attempts to disarm the officer), then the officer could reasonably respond with deadly force.\n\nThe Matrix also allows downward movement. As the officer gains control and/or compliance and the threat reduces or stops using force, then the officer's level of force is reduced to a level appropriate to maintain control over the threat.\n\nAlways keep in mind that your primary goal in a violent or potentially violent situation is to defend yourself or other persons from the threat",

You should not try to equally match your force to the threat's resistance. You should use just enough greater force than the threat, but not deadly force.\n\nExample: You confront a recently fired employee in your client's place of business. You ask this person to leave, but he refuses. You call for police assistance, and you continue to talk and attempt to gain compliance. After you have talked to this person for several minutes, he finally complies and leaves the premises.\n\nYou have responded to this person's low level of resistance with a correspondingly low response on the Matrix. being present in uniform, asking for compliance, giving direction, and getting help on the way.\n\nExample: Now let's take the same situation, but when you initially confront this person, he attacks you with punches and kicks. It is not possible to respond effectively with presence and verbal requests. You should immediately move to an appropriately higher level of force. You respond with force greater than his, but less than deadly force. Such force may include (but is not limited to) pepper spray, defensive tactics control techniques or impact weapons.\n\nIf he stops the attack and backs away, you would properly reduce your force to a level that allows you to maintain control or keep the threat away from you. For instance, if you opted to use pepper spray, you would stop spraying, but you would be ready to use it again if the threat resumed his attack.\n\nExample: Let's look at this same situation again. In this case you confront the person, but before you can say anything, he draws a handgun from under his jacket and points it at you. It would be reasonable for you to believe that you are in immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. Your response is to move immediately to deadly force on the Matrix. You would not be required to attempt to stop his attack at a lower level on the Matrix.\n\nCriminal Penalties for Unlawful Use of Force\n\nIt is a criminal act to use physical force or deadly physical force without justification.

Recklessly endangering another person is a Class A Misdemeanor punishable by up to one year incarceration.\n\nAn example of Recklessly Endangering is an armed private security officer firing at a threat (with or without justification) with an innocent person in the line of fire or in dangerously close proximity to the threat. The innocent person does not have to be killed or injured to complete the crime.

The student will understand that legally and morally justifiable shooting decisions require that the armed private security professional devote prior thought, study and decision-making practice.\n\nThe Decision-Making Process\n\nMost everyday job-related decisions, both great and small, are made by understanding your private security mission, obtaining information, reviewing past experience, comparing options and alternatives, and then using this input to choose a course of action. The process for making use of deadly force decisions is similar, but the stakes are much higher.\n\nUnderstand the Armed Mission\n\nEffective protection of the client requires the armed private security officer to observe, report and coordinate assistance. The armed officer has no statutory duty to protect by direct intervention, and, in any case, that is not the reason why the officer is armed. The armed officer carries the gun because a threat may perceive the officer to stand between him and the threat's objectives (access to the site, theft, escape), and is willing to attack and kill the officer. Also, carrying out the responsibilities of observing and reporting may place the officer in harm's way. The gun is a deterrent to the threat, and a ready means of self defense.\n\nKnow the Facts\n\nBeyond knowing that you are dealing with a potentially dangerous person, the actual facts surrounding the encounter may be unclear or confusing. Most use of force incidents share this characteristic. You may not immediately realize that you are under attack. Your initial contact with the threat may seem routine and innocuous. Since weapons may not be readily visible or may be purposely concealed, the threat may be difficult to identify as a dangerous person. This scarcity of hard facts will require that you be aware and constantly working to gain more information to clarify the situation.",

This is straight forward when the person produces a gun and points it at you.\n\nBut what if a third person tells you someone is armed and threatening to do harm? Deadly force cannot be justified using second hand information. You need to see that the person is actually a deadly threat.\n\nTo help you identify a person as a deadly threat, you must ask and answer these questions:\n1. Is the threat armed?\n2. Could the threat be armed?\n3. What kind of weapon?\n4. What is the threat doing?\n5. Is the threat endangering innocent persons?\n6. Has the threat harmed, or is the threat about to harm innocent persons?\n\nReview Past Experience\n\nReviewing your past experiences and/or training is vital in making sound deadly force decisions. Ask yourself if this current situation is similar to situations you have handled before, or discussed and practiced in training. How did you respond and handle those situations? Were you able to use alternative actions, or did you have to use deadly force?\n\nUnderstand MEANS, OPPORTUNITY and INTENT\n\nThese three requirements, MEANS, OPPORTUNITY and INTENT, MUST be met to justify the use of deadly physical force. All three requirements must exist at the same time.\n\n1. The MEANS exist for person to cause you or another person serious physical injury or death.",

However, some people have the strength or ability to injure you with their hands and feet. Multiple unarmed attackers may be able to overwhelm your defense and seriously injure or kill you. You must realistically assess your physical ability to defend against a larger, better trained (martial arts) or younger opponent.\n\n2. The OPPORTUNITY exists for another person to cause you or another person serious physical injury or death.\n\nIs this person in a location, position or at a distance that will permit him to harm you or another person? A man armed with a knife is not an imminent threat when he is 100 yards away, but if he approaches within twenty feet, he will be able to attack and kill you within two seconds. At 100 yards this man does not have the opportunity to harm even though he has the means (the knife). At twenty feet he does have the opportunity because he could carry out an attack before you could respond. A person armed with a firearm may be a deadly threat at a great distance. He would not need to get close to cause you serious physical injury or death.\n\n3. You reasonably believe that a person has the INTENT to seriously injure or kill you or another.\n\nThis means that this person's actions are directed at you or another in such a way that leads you to believe that the person may inflict serious physical injury or death. For instance, a man, walking toward you carrying a shotgun, has a weapon (MEANS), is within 20 yards and can see you (OPPORTUNITY). However, unless he points the shotgun at you, and unless you reasonably believe that he intends to do you harm (i.e. threatens to kill you), INTENT does not exist. Assessing the totality of circumstances will help you determine if INTENT exists. Let's say that you are on duty at a plant, and you observe an employee take a shotgun from the trunk of his car. The employee may be simply transferring it to a friend's car for an after-work trip to the range. Or, he may be heading into the plant to seek revenge for losing his job. You must evaluate the totality of all the circumstances and actions, as well as the employee's demeanor and response to your questions or commands. All of these factors will help you determine if this person intends to place you or another in jeopardy.\n\nConsider the Totality of the Circumstances In addition to MEANS, OPPORTUNITY and INTENT the decision to use force is influenced by one or more factors that a reasonable person must consider.

You should expect and be ready to encounter a bleeding, and, perhaps, dying threat, distraught by-standers, shouted accusations and witnesses. Due to your natural survival response you may not remember firing your weapon or hearing its report. You may be experiencing \"tunnel vision\" in which your senses and thoughts focus solely on the threat to the exclusion of other activity around you. You may feel elated to have survived and, at the same time, guilty for harming another human being. Law enforcement psychologists know that these reactions are normal and to be expected.\n\nAlways remember that this immediate aftermath is a very dangerous time. The threat may not be out of the fight and could still pose a danger to you and others. You may be wounded, but you should be mentally prepared to remain alert and in readiness to continue the fight if necessary. Additional unidentified threats may be a danger, and you must be looking for them and ready to engage if needed.\n\nRecommended Post-Shooting Actions\n\nThink about the following recommended post-shooting responses and visualize yourself carrying them out in a calm and professional manner.\n\n1. Get behind cover and observe the threat until you are reasonably certain that the threat is no longer a danger. A weapon in the threat's hand would be an indicator that he or she may still be capable of harming you or another person.\n2.

The main goal is to stay calm, to make no suspicious or sudden movements, and let the police sort out the situation.\n5. Cooperate with the police, but remember that you do not have to talk to them or give a statement without an attorney's advice. If you choose to not answer questions or give a statement, be prepared to be detained or arrested based on the information that the police officers have at that time. Be as calm as possible and do not resist.\n\n6. Be prepared to surrender your weapon and other personal items including clothing.\n\nBefore you begin work as an armed officer, you may wish to speak with your employer about what legal assistance will be provided to you in the event of a shooting. You should also ask about the availability of counseling to help you deal with your emotions and perceptions following a deadly force encounter.
