If you are available less than that on a routine basis, you must update your schedule.\n- You must select your locations when you are added to the system. We recommend that you choose location groups, which are shown at the top of the list (examples: All Regions, Far Northeast Region, All High Schools...), rather than selecting individual schools. Selecting only individual schools will severely limit the number of assignments for which you will be called. Do not choose locations labeled as \"inactive\".\n- You must select your classification(s) when you are first added to the system. It is your responsibility to keep your classification (aka subject area/grade/Special Education paraprofessional type) preferences up to date. Do not choose classifications that are labeled as \"inactive'.",
