With the revision of corresponding ISO Standard, this standard is also revised to align it with the latest ISO Standard. This revision incorporates among others, the following changes:\na) Normative reference clause has been added.\nb) Requirements on harvesting, characteristics for storage, prestorage treatment and sizing have been modified.\nc) In method of storage, a space left between both below and above the stacks have been reduced to 0.5 m from 1.5 m earlier.\n\nIn the adopted standard certain terminology and conventions are not identical with those used in the Indian Standards. Attention is drawn specially to the following:\na) Wherever the words 'International Standard' appear, referring to this standard, they should be read as 'Indian Standard'.\nb) Comma (,) has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards, the current practice is to use a point (.) as the decimal marker.\n\nIn this Indian Standard, the following International Standard is referred to. Read in its respective place the following:\n\nInternational Standard\nISO 2169 : 1981, Fruits and vegetables - Physical conditions in cold stores - Definitions and measurement\n\nIndian Standard\nDegree of Correspondence\nIS 7252: 1974 Guide for testing of physi- Related cal conditions in cold stores",

        "text": "Indian Standard GARLIC - COLD STORAGE \\\\ (First Revision)\n\n\n1 Scope\n\nThis International Standard gives guidance on conditions for cold storage for the successful keeping of garlic (Allium sativum Linnaeus) intended for consumption in the fresh state.\n\n2 Normative reference\n\nThe following standard contains provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this International Standard. At the time of publication, the edition indicated was valid. All standards are subject to revision, and parties to agreements based on this International Standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent edition of the standard indicated below. Members of IEC and ISO maintain registers of currently valid International Standards.\n\nISO 2169:1981, Fruits and vegetables - Physical conditions in cold stores - Definitions and measurement.\n\n3 Conditions for harvesting and storage\n\n3.1 Harvesting\n\nGarlic intended for storage should be harvested when the tips or leaves begin to turn yellow, the neck tissue of the bulb begins to soften, and the mass of the bulb no longer increases. The bulbs should be well formed and physiologically at rest. The protective exterior scale should be dry and have a characteristic colour.\n\nHarvesting should be carried out during dry weather over a short period of time.\n\n3.2 Characteristics for storage\n\nOnly those varieties (cultivars) of garlic suitable for long-term keeping should be stored. Garlic intended\nfor cold storage should be of good commercial quality. It should be:\n- clean, dry and whole;\n- firm, ripe but not sprouting;\n- healthy with a dry exterior scale;\n- free from all field and store pests (nematodes and mites);\n- free from sun or frost damage; and\n- free of any foreign odour or taste.\n\n3.3 Prestorage treatment\n\nAfter harvesting, the garlic should be dried (cured). This operation begins in the fields and continues in the store rooms at temperatures of $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for 8 or 10 days, or at temperatures of $35^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for $1 / 2$ to 1 day, with $60 \\%$ or $75 \\%$ relative humidity.\n\nDisinfection of the bulbs with methyl bromide (bromomethane) is permissible only for garlic to be used for seed.\n\nThe storage life of garlic can be extended by using treatment with maleic hydrazide or other sprout inhibitors before harvesting. This treatment is effective for the control of sprouting and weight losses.\n\n3.4 Sizing\n\nSizing of garlic bulbs should be carried out according to their diameters. The minimum diameter is 45 mm for garlic in the Extra Class, and 30 mm for garlic in Classes I and II. The differences in diameters of bulbs which are in the same package should not exceed $2,5 \\mathrm{~mm}$.",

        "text": "3.5 Packing\n\nGarlic should be packed for storage in cases (boxes), box pallets (boxes which can be stored on pallets), metal-mesh containers or sacks which can be stored on pallets.\n\nThe packing material should be clean, new and of a quality to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce, but not prevent circulation of air around the product.\n\n3.6 Putting into storage\n\nWith the exception of onions, garlic should not be stored with other produce. The stores should be filled within a short period of time.\n\n3.7 Method of storage\n\nSacks should be filled in a manner that ensures circulation of air. Box pallets or sacks on post pallets may be stacked up to five or six high. For boxes which can be stored on pallets, stacking may be up to eight or nine high, leaving spaces to allow the circulation of air in all directions.\n\nA space of about $0,5 \\mathrm{~m}$ should be left both below and above the stacks.\n\n4 Optimum storage conditions\n\nFor measurement of the physical quantities affecting storage, see ISO 2169.\n\n4.1 Temperature\n\nGarlic should be stored at $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and temperature variations should not exceed $\\pm 0.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\n4.2 Relative humidity\n\nDuring storage the relative humidity of the air should be maintained between $65 \\%$ and $75 \\%$.\n\n4.3 Air circulation\n\nAir should be circulated constantly to ensure a homogeneous temperature.\n\n4.4 Storage life\n\nThe storage life varies with the variety (cultivar) and method of cultivation and ranges from 130 to 220 days. The condition of the stored product should be checked every 7 to 10 days.\n\n4.5 Operations at the end of storage\n\nWhen removed from cold store, garlic should be gradually rewarmed to avoid condensation forming on the surface of the product.\n\nIf required, garlic should be sorted according to quality.",
