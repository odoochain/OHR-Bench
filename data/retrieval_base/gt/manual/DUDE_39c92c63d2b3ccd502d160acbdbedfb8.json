Certain conventions are, however, not identical to those used in Indian Standards. Attention is particularly drawn to the following:\na) Wherever the words 'International Standard' appear referring to this standard, they should be read as 'Indian Standard'.\nb) Comma (,) has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards, the current practice is to use a point (.) as the decimal marker.\n\nIn reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS $2: 1960$ 'Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)'.",

The classification may include classes A to $F$ (see Table 1). The classification of the spraying equipment depends on the amount of reduction of spray drift determined by using one of the test methods given in other parts of ISO 22369.\n\nTable 1 - Drift reduction classes\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  Class & F & E & D & C & B & A \\\\\n  Drift reduction, $\\%$ & $25 \\leqslant 50$ & $50 \\leqslant 75$ & $75 \\leqslant 90$ & $90 \\leqslant 95$ & $95 \\leqslant 99$ & $\\geqslant 99$ \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",
