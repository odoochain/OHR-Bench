Acts approved by Congress May 8 and June 30, 1914.\n\n\nThe Plans in This Book . . .\n\nThe plans that you will find listed on the following pages are generally recommended for Illinois. They have been tested by wide use. The small charge made for each plan is only enough to cover the cost of printing and handling.\n\nThe plans in this book were selected from a large number prepared by the University of Illinois, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and the Midwest Plan Service. The Midwest Plan Service is a cooperative program of the states in the North-Central region, of which Illinois is a part. Plans are developed cooperatively, are published as Midwest plans, and are then distributed by the individual states. In the future an increasing number of the plans distributed by the University of Illinois College of Agriculture will be Midwest plans. Illinois will continue, however, to develop new designs and to prepare plans to meet needs not otherwise satisfied.\n\nThese plans and planning aids are one result of the research work carried on by the Department of Agricultural Engineering in a wide variety of subjects connected with farm buildings and rural housing. Much of this research is conducted through cooperative projects with other departments, other state experiment stations, and the U. S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nFarm and home advisers are ready to help in selecting plans, placing orders, or obtaining information. Many materials dealers, contractors, and vocational-agriculture teachers are also familiar with these plans and can give advice about them.\n\nFarm-building planning at the University of Illinois College of Agriculture is concerned with more than just the preparation and distribution of plans. Some of the other activities include county or community meetings at which extension specialists discuss farmbuilding problems, short courses and conferences, and the distribution of publications on a variety of subjects relating to building. Personal planning is not a part of the service but questions are answered by correspondence, visitors talk over problems with staff members, and some demonstration planning is carried on.\n\nHow to Order . . .\n\nPlans. Send orders and payment to the Department of Agricultural Engineering, University of Illinois, College of Agriculture, Urbana, Illinois. List plans by name and number.\n\nIllinois and regional publications (page 19). Write to Department of Agricultural Engineering, University of Illinois, College of Agriculture, Urbana, Illinois.\n\nFree publications of U. S. Department of Agriculture (page 18). Write to Division of Publications, Office of Information, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D. C.\n\nSmall Homes Council publications (page 18). Send orders with payment to the Small Homes Council, Mumford House, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois.",

        "text": "PLANNING FARM BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS\n\nA long-time program for building construction, maintenance, and remodeling, projected the same way that a crop or livestock program is projected, will keep you from making expensive mistakes in your building improvements. Such a program is the only sound basis for such decisions as whether to make minor repairs on an old building so that it can be used a few more years, make major repairs and alterations on an existing building so that it will serve many more years, or build a new building.\n\nIf you decide on a new building, you need to give careful consideration to several questions before you are ready to build. What is the best way to arrange the space in the building? How large should it be? What building materials ought to be used? How much ought you to spend? Where should you locate it?\n\nStart with a good plan. Those that you find in this book will help you make a good choice, whatever building you have in mind. They have been planned and designed in line with the recommendations of the College of Agriculture. The building types, measurements, arrangements, and constructions they show have been proved by research and experience. Even though no one of the plans satisfies your building needs in every detail, the plans can be used as a guide to good construction and effective arrangement.\n\nThe special requirements and problems of different farm enterprises have been considered in developing these plans. For example, sanitation has been emphasized in designing structures for use in hog production. Shelters and equipment for beef cattle aim for efficient handling of the animals. Dairy barns and milkhouses meet the requirements for the production of grade A milk. Cribs and bins have been designed for safe storage and conditioning.\n\nIn deciding on a plan, you will normally have to choose between two or more systems of housing. For example, you will need to decide whether you prefer the loose housing barn for your dairy cattle or the stanchion barn, whether you will use individual houses or a central house for swine farrowing, whether you want ground level or loft storage for hay, and whether you will have ear-corn cribs or shelled-corn bins.\n\nFigure building size and capacity carefully. Adjust to the amount of crops, livestock, and equipment you will store or house. Most of the plans in this book are for buildings of a definite size, but in the exact size shown they would meet the needs of only a few farms. The size can be varied to meet the needs of the individual farm; the plans will show good arrangements and standard methods of construction. Ordinarily farm buildings can best be varied in size by changing the length without affecting width, height, or type of construction.\n\nChoose a suitable building material. Most of the plans are adaptable enough that materials other than those shown on the plans can be used. Roofing materials are usually not indicated, so their choice is left entirely up to the builder. Prefabricated parts or fully prefabricated buildings can be used in place of ordinary construction; the plans can then be used merely as a guide to effective space arrangement.\n\nBalance amount spent against expected return. Buildings must pay out in terms of their value for shelter, storage, labor saved, and improved quality of products. You normally cannot justify elaborate buildings where low-cost buildings - pole frames, open sheds, or straw shelters - will serve the purpose. You may justify a higher investment, however, where increased returns can be expected from better-quality buildings.\n\nHigh costs of construction can best be offset by carefully planning each step of the job to insure that you get the maximum improvement for each dollar spent. There is no magic way to cut down building costs. You can, however, make a sizable reduction in the cash outlay by using as much of your own labor as possible. Using materials already on the farm or available locally will also help.\n\nLocate the building wisely. A good location may mean the difference between convenience and efficiency on one hand and dissatisfaction on the other. Give careful consideration to such things as sheltered yards, windbreaks, drainage, access from driveways, and distances between buildings.",

On most farms the amount of machinery has simply outgrown the storage space. Expensive machinery either sits out in the weather or is inadequately stored.\n\nUtility storages such as all-steel buildings, arched-roof structures, and pole frames with wood, steel, or aluminum covering are being used more and more to provide the larger shelters needed. It is generally advisable to include a farm shop when planning a new machinery storage.\nMACHINE SHED, arched roof. Plan 457 (15¢). 36 feet wide. Can use either home-built or commercial rafters.

        "text": "CROP STORAGE BUILDINGS\n\nBuildings for crop storage must protect the crops from moisture, rodents, and insects and be strong enough to resist heavy loads. Because they are loaded so heavily, no attempt should be made to build one without carefully prepared plans.\n\nA wide variety of designs is available for crop storage. These range from temporary silos and cribs and pole-frame sheds for hay and bedding to permanent farm-built or manufactured silos, cribs, and grain storages.\n\nCorn cribs are limited to about 8 feet in width for natural drying over most of Illinois; 7 feet is better in the two northern tiers of counties. Height to the plate is limited to 16 or 18 feet; otherwise too much corn will be damaged by dropping. The height should not be more than 14 feet in cribs designed without cross-bracing.\n\nMost cribs can be adapted readily for drying ear corn. Some new cribs are planned especially to permit effective drying by forcedair ventilation either with or without heat. It is expected that artificial conditioning will be more common in the future and that more and more farmers will shell their corn direct from the field and dry it immediately. Tight bins of wood; steel, or masonry can then be used for the storage of dried shelled corn. The following references, available from the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Urbana, will be found useful in this connection.\n\nDrying Corn in Cribs.

        "text": "beEf CATTLE HOUSING AND EQUIPMENT\n\nBeef cattle need a dry bed and protection during cold and stormy weather, but they do not require elaborate housing. A good arrangement of barns and lots, a design that will simplify feeding and management, storage space for feed and bedding, and easy removal of manure are often just as important as shelter.\n\nBoth open sheds and enclosed barns are used for housing beef cattle, but in Illinois and surrounding states sheds are more common than barns. In either one, however, some enclosed space is needed for young calves and for cows at calving time.\n\nOpen sheds usually have the front open to the south or east and are enclosed at the back and on both ends. Permanent sheds should normally be at least 20 feet from front to back, or deeper if racks or bunks are placed inside. At least 8 feet of headroom is needed; 9 feet is better to allow for accumulation of manure and to accommodate power-operated manure loaders. The roof should be self-supporting to give post-free space inside the building and make it easier to use poweroperated manure loaders.\n\nEnclosed barns protect the stock better and often have space to store bedding and hay and other feed. The most widely used type of enclosed barn, shown above, has a center section for hay\n\nstorage from the ground up and attached sheds for the livestock. The sheds for livestock in an enclosed barn should normally be at least 16 feet wide and 18 to 20 feet is better yet. When stock is kept in enclosed barns, it is well to leave some doors open to the south or east.\n\nIn most localities a concrete feedlot is recommended. Concrete floors are not necessary in the pen areas, although they are desirable because they are permanent and easier to clean.\n\nOn many farms housing for beef cattle can be readily provided by remodeling an old general purpose barn, if it is in reasonably good condition. All that needs to be done is to remove old pens, stall partitions, and other interior construction not needed to support the loft and then add openings, feed racks, and other equipment.\n\nFor detailed planning information, send for North-Central Regional Publication No. 6, \"Beef Cattle Housing\" (free).",

        "text": "HOG HOUSING AND EQUIPMENT\n\nThe most critical time in a hog's life is from birth until it reaches a weight of about 75 pounds. During this period it needs a carefully planned house and protective equipment.\n\nSome of the more important features of a good hog-housing system are:\n\nEnough space for the animals\nProtection from cold, wind, rain, and snow, and from too much summer sunshine\n\nGuard rails and other equipment and constructions that will protect the animals\n\nTemperatures and moisture conditions in the house that help to keep the animals healthy and comfortable\n\nEasy to keep sanitary\nOpportunity to feed and handle the animals with a minimum of the operator's time\n\nThe current interest in winter and early spring farrowing and in houses for year-round (hatchery) production emphasizes the central hog house for the larger enterprises. Central houses help to save labor by centering the work in one building, but to meet present needs such houses have to be provided with supplementary heat, heat lamps, insulation, and facilities for sanitation. New designs are being studied and plans will be made available that will incorporate these features.\n\nThree types of movable houses are in good demand: (1) individual houses, such as Plans 428 and 262 shown on page 13 ; (2) multi-unit houses with room for 2,3 , or 4 pens; and (3) divided 3 -unit houses which can be brought together to form 6-pen houses with a service alley in the center (Plan 507, page 13, illustrated below).\n\nReady-made movable hog houses and selffeeders can be bought from materials dealers and manufacturers. It may be more practicable to buy these prefabricated items than to make them on the farm.\n\nA number of Midwest plans for structures which serve as grain storages can be converted readily to farrowing houses or self-feeders (see page 7). They are Plan 72626 (15¢), two-unit house or 300 -bushel bin; Plan 72627 (30 ¢); central farrowing house or 3,400 -bushel bin; Plan 77613 (15¢) self-feeder and short-time storage; Plan 77614 (15¢), self-feeder or 400 -bushel bin; and Plan 77615 (30¢), self-feeder, drier, or bin for 550 bushels of ear corn or 1,100 bushels of shelled corn.",

        "text": "POULTRY HOUSING AND EQUIPMENT\n\nA farm poultry enterprise usually needs houses for growing stock (fryers, broilers, or replacements); laying houses; and equipment such as nests, roosts, feeders, and waterers. The houses must be carefully designed, especially in the colder regions, to protect the birds from rain and snow, cold wind, dampness, extreme changes in temperature, low temperature, and high summer temperatures.\n\nHouses for growing stock. For farm flocks the common type of house for young chicks or growing stock is a single-unit brooder house from $10 \\times 12$ feet to $12 \\times 14$ feet for 200 to 300 baby chicks. Single-unit houses can be bought prefabricated so that they come to the farm ready to use.\n\nLaying houses. Laying houses for farm-size flocks may be either uninsulated, partly insulated with a straw loft and ventilated attic, or tightly built, fully insulated houses with controlled ventilation.\n\nThe straw-loft house is commonly recommended for Illinois. The straw fill lets moisture out and permits air to circulate. With ventilated space above the straw and with adjustable windows, ventilation is reasonably good and a special ventilating system is not needed. In the coldest\nparts of Illinois, fully insulated houses with ventilating systems will maintain better conditions inside, but they are more expensive. Uninsulated houses are built with only one layer of wood or other material for siding and have a low roof without a loft. They are generally used in the southern part of Illinois.\n\nLaying houses are planned on the basis of about 3 to 4 square feet of floor area per bird, depending on the breed. Less space results in overcrowding. A house 20 feet square will take care of 100 to 135 hens and is sometimes called a unit house.\n\nEquipment. When considering the equipment for a laying house, it is well to plan for:\n\n8 to 10 inches of roosting space per bird\none open nest for each 5 or 6 hens or one trap nest for each 3 or 4 hens\nabout 1 foot of mash-hopper feeding space for every 5 hens\nan ample water supply - preferably running water with automatic controls and protection against freezing\nrodent-proof feed storage - metal cans or barrels, or in a large house a separate feed room\ntwo 40 - to 60 -watt lights with reflectors over the feed hoppers for each 20 -foot length of pen",

        "text": "PLANNING THE FARMSTEAD\n\nPlanning of farm buildings should begin with a study of the farmstead so that each new building can be located to best advantage and the arrangement of buildings, driveway, yards, and plantings can be effective and attractive. A longtime plan is needed as a guide. Each improvement as it is added can then be located to fit into the long-time plan.\n\nThe general principles of farm planning are the same for most farmsteads even though the details vary because of differences between farms. The following suggestions apply to most farmsteads in Illinois.\n\nLocate each new building on elevated ground so that surface water will drain away from it. If necessary, build the floor above the ground line and grade the ground to get the right slope.\n\nTry to group buildings according to the production program; place animal shelters, hay storage, grain and feed supplies, and feeding floors or milk rooms in compact, labor-saving units. Keep machinery-storage and shop buildings away from barns to minimize danger from fire, but place them so it will be easy to get machinery in and out.\n\nLocate a new dwelling 80 to 100 feet from the road with the garage near the house. Poultry\nbuildings may be reasonably close to the house 100 feet or even less.\n\nPlan a service court or farmyard so that you will not have to go through gates to reach the principal buildings. Make the court large enough for trucks, tractors, and farm machinery to be handled and turned easily. This means the yard should be at least 80 feet across the narrow width.\n\nProtect feedlots, pens, and yards by locating them to the south or south and east of the barns and other shelters. This arrangement will cut off cold winds in winter, get as much sunlight as possible in the lots, and reduce the danger of icy yards.\n\nLocate windbreaks north and west of the buildings. Keep the area reasonably open to the south and southwest. Avoid locating hog lots and cattle yards southwest of the dwelling.\n\nUsually provide only one all-weather driveway from the road into the farmstead. Provide space for parking cars. Make it easy to get to the front and back doors of the house, to the garage, and to the farm buildings from the driveway.\n\nPlan for water supply and electric service to all principal buildings and for septic-tank sewage disposal from the dwelling.\n\n\nFARMSTEAD PLANNING AID.\nPlan 459 (60¢). A set of seven farm-building models. These models can be used to study farmstead arrangement and location of buildings. They are printed in two colors, cut, and creased for folding. Plan 467 (156¢) is a scaled layout sheet or grid for farmstead planning.",

Because farm housing is too large a subject to be covered in this brief space, only some of the recent developments can be mentioned here.\n\nCircular 620 (Regional Publication 8), \"When You Build or Remodel Your Farmhouse,\" will help you in planning before you start to build. Circular C7.2, \"A Basic Farmhouse Plan,\" illustrates and describes an unusually popular, highly adaptable farmhouse. Both publications are free on request. Complete plans for the basic farmhouse, Plan 480 , are $\\$ 1.00$.\n\n\nIdeas for remodeling may be obtained from ten blueprint sheets which show how Illinois farm families have remodeled their houses. Ask for \"ten remodeling plans\" ( $\\$ 1.50$ ). See pages 18 and 19 for other farm-housing publications.\n\nA significant advance in farmhouse planning is a 1952 series of plans prepared at the University of Illinois as part of a North-Central regional program. These plans (listed at right) are called \"Flexi-plans\" because they can be varied in so many ways. Only three of the many variations are shown here. By selecting from among the\ncombinations of bedrooms and daytime rooms included in each plan, you can choose the arrangement, number of rooms, and size of house that most nearly meets your need. The plans are in the Midwest series, which means they can be obtained from other colleges of agriculture, mostly in the North-Central states, as well as from Illinois.\n\nEach set of plans is complete in itself. Additional plans, catalogs, or printed descriptions are in preparation.\n\n\nTHREE-LEVEL FARMHOUSE. Plan 71201 ( $\\$ 1.80$ ).\nEight plan variations.
