        "text": "Operating Instructions\n\nEssentially simple to operate, the Toolbar Cultivator has several features with which the owner should be conversant.\n\nThe Toolbar and Head Stock\n\nPatented clamps forming part of the Lower and Upper Hitch Bracket Assemblies may be slackened off and moved to a limited extent in or out from the normal position (see assembly instructions) to allow for particular tine spacing when cultivating row crops.\n\nThe main bar may also be offset to one side for orchard cultivation or similar work.\n\nThe Fixed Tyne Toolbar\n\nWhen cultivating row crops it is possible to raise the front tines in their clamps by means of the series of holes in the upper part of the tine. This enables close cultivation without danger to roots whilst the rear tines are allowed to penetrate deeper.\n\nThe fixed tines are designed with a shear bolt to protect the tine in the event of striking an obstruction.\n\nThe Stump Jump Toolbar\n\nHere, again, the tines can be spaced as required. The pre-loading of the springs is accomplished by positioning of the nut and locknut behind the spring pressure collar on both front and rear tines.\n\nThe pitch of the tines may be set individually by positioning the fully screwed clamp bolt against the head of which the tine upper end is held by the pressure of the spring. The penetrating ability of partly worn points can be improved by increasing the pitch in this manner.\n\nWhen repositioning the tines on the bar it is necessary to slacken the pressure on the springs.\n\nOn all tines the point is secured by one bolt and a tongue which is held by the tine strap. These straps are rivetted, and may be replaced when worn.\n\nA full range of tine points is illustrated at the back of this book.\n\nServicing Instructions\n\nTyre pressures (where depth wheels are fitted) should be maintained at approximately $45 \\mathrm{lbs} . / \\mathrm{sq}$. in. This is, of course, dependent upon conditions, since the object of the pneumatic tyres is to utilise their flexibility to prevent soil adherence. Using the above figure as a basis, practice will dictate the correct tyre pressure.\n\nDepth wheel should be lubricated twice daily when in use. When replacing felt seals, provided for grease retention, it is advisable to soak the new seals in oil for ease of fitting.\n\nOn the stump jump tine a lubrication point is provided on the Inner Spring Pressure Collar. This point should be greased once daily.\n\nThe threaded section of the Spring Pressure Rod should be frequently given a protective coating of grease.",
