        "text": "Indian Standard SPECIFICATION FOR OUTDOOR STEEL BINS FOR FOODGRAIN STORAGE\n\n\n\n0. FOREWORD\n\n0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution on 25 May 1979, after the draft finalized by the Storage Structures and Storage Management Sectional Committee had been approved by the Agricultural and Food Products Division Council.\n0.2 Bins made of steel are gaining popularity for storage of foodgrains. Outdoor bins up to capacity $7 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ are generally preferred by farmers for such storage. With a view to helping the manufacturers to fabricate bins of required quality and performance and helping farmers in getting proper type of bins, this standard has been formulated.\n0.3 It is recommended that the flat-bottom bins should be suitably mounted on prefabricated steel elevated base. The hopper-bottom bins should be mounted on brick masonry columns as given in Appendix A.\n0.4 The requirements contained in this standard are based on the survey carried out and designs developed by the Indian Grain Storage Institute, Hapur. Other types of bins will be taken up as and when developed by other organizations.\n0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.\n\n1. SCOPE\n1.1 This standard prescribes requirements for materials, dimensions, capacities and method of construction of circular galvanized plain steel outdoor bins for bulk storage of grains at farm level. This standard includes flat- and hopper-bottom bins.\n\n\n*Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised).",

TERMINOLOGY\n2.1 Grains - All cereals, pulses, milled products, oilseeds and the grains intended to be used as seed ( see IS : 2813-1970*) .\n2.2 Grain Storage Bin - A structure designed for holding grain in bulk.\n2.3 Flat-Bottom Bin - A bin with a horizontal steel bottom from which all the quality of grain does not flow out by gravity.\n2.4 Hopper-Bottom Bin - A bin with a sloping or conical bottom which is self-emptying.\n\n3. DESGRIPTION\n3.1 The outdoor flat-bottom steel bin ( see Fig. 1) consists of a cylindrical body and conical roof having the same diameter with variable heights so as to provide five different capacities. The conical roof with a slope of $25^{\\circ}$ should be made by joining 12 roof panels and roof stiffeners. The bin should have an inlet either at the centre or at the side of the roof to facilitate filling of the bin and the inclined outlets be provided at the bottom of the bin at the floor level. In a small-capacity bin only one outlet should be provided while for large capacity structures two outlets diagonally located may be provided. The flat-bottom bins should be mounted on prefabricated steel elevated base is given in Appendix A.\n3.2 The outdoor hopper-bottom bin (see Fig. 2) consists of a cylindrical body conical roof and self-emptying type hopper having the hopper angle either of $35^{\\circ}$ or $45^{\\circ}$ as required for different foodgrains. The hopper part of the bin carries one single outlet at the bottom which facilitates the emptying of the structure completely. The hopper bottom of the bin has an advantage over the flat-bottom bin as the former allows complete discharge of the grain while certain quantity of the grain is left over in the case of flat-bottom bin. The remaining grain from the flat-bottom bin is ultimately required to be reclaimed manually. The spout of the bin would be nearly 750 mm about the ground level to facilitate filling of the bags conveniently. The details of the construction of the foundation are given in Appendix A.\n\n4. CAPACITIES AND DIMENSIONS\n4.1 The capacities and dimensions of the flat-bottom and hopper-bottom bins shall be as given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n\n*Terminology for foodgrains (First revision).",
