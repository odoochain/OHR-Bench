        "text": "# What is Medical Home Port?\n\nThe Navy's Medical Home Port concept introduces a new model of patient and family-centered health care delivery for primary care. This model emphasizes team-based, comprehensive care that is designed to fully meet the complete primary care health and wellness needs of our patients. The model emphasizes the provider/patient relationship and leveraging other members of the primary care team to actively participate in patient care.\n\nIt has been shown to improve access to care for patients through the use of electronic communications and more efficient face-to-face encounters. It is expected to improve population health, patient satisfaction, and medical readiness across multiple settings once fully implemented.\n\nAt U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Medical Home Port is being phased into service in the Pediatric Clinic, Family Medicine Clinic, Internal Medicine Clinic and Branch Health Clinics.\n\n# Contact Us\n\n## Appointment Scheduling and Clinic Clerks\n\n* **Business Hours:** 0730-1630\n* **Commercial:** 046-816-5352\n* **DSN:** 243-5352\n\n## On Call Provider (After Hours - Urgent)\n\n* **Phone:** 080-5973-2030\n\n## Prescription Refill System\n\n* **Commercial:** 046-816-4689\n* **DSN:** 243-4689\n\n## Hospital Information Desk (24 Hours)\n\n* **Commercial:** 046-816-7144\n* **DSN:** 243-7144\n\n## Emergency Assistance\n\n* **On Base:** 911\n* **Off Base:** 119\n\n# U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL YOKOSUKA\n\n# MEDICAL HOME PORT",
