You can also find more troubleshooting information in Mac Help and on the MacBook Air Support website at www.apple.com/support/macbookair.\n\nIf you experience a problem with your MacBook Air, there's usually a simple and quick solution. Think about the conditions that led up to the problem. Making a note of things you did before the problem occurred will help you narrow down possible causes and find the answers you need. Things to note include:\n- The applications you were using when the problem occurred. Problems that occur only with a specific application might indicate that the application is not compatible with the version of the Mac OS installed on your computer.\n- Any new software that you installed, especially software that added items to the System folder.\n\n\nProblems That Prevent You from Using Your MacBook Air\n\n\nIf your MacBook Air doesn't respond or the pointer doesn't move\n\nOn rare occasions, an application might \"freeze\" on the screen. Mac OS X provides a way to quit a frozen application without restarting your computer. Quitting a frozen application might allow you to save your work in other open applications.\n\nTo force an application to quit:\n1 Press Command (\\&)-Option-Esc or choose Apple ( $\\mathbf{(})>$ Force Quit from the menu bar.

Wait 10 seconds and then turn on the computer.\n\nIf the problem occurs frequently, choose Help > Mac Help from the menu bar at the top of the screen. Search for the word \"freeze\" to get help for instances when the computer freezes or doesn't respond.\n\nIf the problem occurs only when you use a particular application, check with the application's manufacturer to see if it is compatible with your computer. To get support and contact information for the software that came with your MacBook Air, go to www.apple.com/guide.\n\nIf you know an application is compatible, you might need to reinstall your computer's system software. See \"Reinstalling the Software That Came with Your MacBook Air\" on page 47.\n\nIf your MacBook Air freezes during startup, or you see a flashing question mark, or the display is dark and the sleep indicator light is glowing steadily (not in sleep) The flashing question mark usually means that the computer can't find the system software on the hard disk or on any disks attached to the computer.",

Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation. See instructions if interference to radio or television reception is suspected.\nL'utilisation de ce dispositif est autorisÃ©e seulement aux conditions suivantes: (1) il ne doit pas produire de brouillage et (2) I'utilisateur du dispositif doit Ã©tre prÃªt Ã  accepter tout brouillage radioÃ©lectrique reÃ§u, mÃªme si ce brouillage est susceptible de compromettre le fonctionnement du dispositif.\n\nRadio and Television Interference\n\nThis computer equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio-frequency energy. If it is not installed and used properly - that is, in strict accordance with Apple's instructions-it may cause interference with radio and television reception.\nThis equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device in accordance with the specifications in Part 15 of FCC rules. These specifications are designed to provide reasonable protection against such interference in a residential installation. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation.\nYou can determine whether your computer system is causing interference by turning it off. If the interference stops, it was probably caused by the computer or one of the peripheral devices.\n\nIf your computer system does cause interference to radio or television reception, try to correct the interference by using one or more of the following measures:\n- Turn the television or radio antenna until the interference stops.\n- Move the computer to one side or the other of the television or radio.\n- Move the computer farther away from the television or radio.\n- Plug the computer in to an outlet that is on a different circuit from the television or radio. (That is, make certain the computer and the television or radio are on circuits controlled by different circuit breakers or fuses.)\nIf necessary, consult an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple. See the service and support information that came with your Apple product. Or consult an experienced radio/television technician for additional suggestions.\nImportant: Changes or modifications to this product not authorized by Apple Inc., could void the EMC compliance and negate your authority to operate the product.\nThis product has demonstrated EMC compliance under conditions that included the use of compliant peripheral devices and shielded cables (including Ethernet network cables) between system components. It is important that you use compliant peripheral devices and shielded cables between system components to reduce the possibility of causing interference to radios, television sets, and other electronic devices.",
