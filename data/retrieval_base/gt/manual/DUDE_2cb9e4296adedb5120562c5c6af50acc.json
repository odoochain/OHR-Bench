        "text": "The RFeye - a unique approach\n\nCRFS pioneered the concept of remote, distributed, real-time networks of intelligent spectrum sensors providing continuous $24 / 7$ monitoring of the RF environment.\n\nThe RFeye was designed as a completely new approach to spectrum monitoring and signals capture based deployment of cost-effective networks of nodes continuously monitoring areas of interest and accessible from anywhere in the world via IP. The RFeye Node was created specifically to meet these requirements.\n\nLightweight, low power, small footprint and housed in a robust IP67 enclosure, RFeye Nodes are simple to install, connect and start up and, once fitted, they take care of themselves. \"Fit and forget\". Each Node has its own in-built Linux processor and proprietary control protocol that allows it to operate fully autonomously and, where required, in cooperation with other Nodes in the network. No local PC server is required and each network node is directly IP addressable.\n\nThrough careful design we created a compact packaged unit at an attractive price-point without sacrificing RF performance. We paid special attention to achieving an excellent noise figure and very low spurious elements despite the size constraints.\n\nThe RFeye provides 24/7 real-time access and also records data for subsequent analysis and playback. Data can be logged to local USB or solid state memory or relayed over IP to a central server. On-board",

        "text": "Spectrum intelligence as a key to operational planning and security\n\n\nSystems and solutions for spectrum critical sites, border monitoring, SIGINT applications and TSCM for secure facilities.\n\nCRFS manufactures and supplies high performance RFeye systems and provides turnkey solutions for cost-effective deployment across any area, large or small, in-building or outdoors, fixed location or mobile. All products are designed and manufactured to the highest standards in compliance with ISO 9001:2008.\n\nRFeye systems are used on sensitive sites and installations, along borders and in buildings, for detection of suspicious or unauthorized transmissions that may indicate a potential threat, security breach or cyber attack. They are also deployed on spectrum critical sites, such as government ranges, military bases and training grounds, to manage essential frequency bands and locate any sources of interference. National regulators use our systems to monitor spectrum usage and to help manage interference and detect license infringements. Finally,\n\nCRFS provides high performance signal capture and analysis modules for integration into broader SIGINT or EW systems.\n\nWe serve customers internationally in military and intelligence, police and homeland security, as well as civilians in spectrum agencies and regulators, sports stadia, public safety, airports and prisons.\n\nCRFS is headquartered in Cambridge, UK and has a US office in California. We have a large network of agents and distributors around the world providing local incountry integration services and customer support. We also partner with system integrators, value-added resellers and OEMs.\n\nCRFS is proud to have been awarded with the 2013 Queen's Award for Enterprise, International Trade in recognition of our significant growth in overseas sales over the past 3 years.\n\nTDOA geolocation from wide area RFeye network",

Providing uninterrupted $24 / 7$ surveillance and awareness of the RF environment up to 18 GHz , RFeye Secure provides a high level of security for the most sensitive areas, including X-listed operations rooms, Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF), Secure Work Environments (SWE) and facilities containing Special Access Programmes (SAP). By detecting the presence, location and signal characteristics of suspicious transmitters such as bugging devices, or detecting unusual\npatterns of radio transmissions, RFeye Secure can help identify potential security breaches or provide intelligence to mitigate specific risks.\n\n\nRFeye Secure in-building transmitter geolocation using POA\n\nRFeye Detect is designed for wide area spectrum monitoring, interference management and real-time response requirements for any spectrum intensive or sensitive locations such as critical infrastructure sites, military training \\& proving grounds, airport facilities, sports stadia and special event arenas. Sources of unauthorized transmissions can be quickly identified, investigated and geolocated using reliable techniques such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), Power on Arrival (POA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA). This can lead to fast resolution of spectrum conflicts and help support spectrum operations on the site. RFeye Detect can also be deployed for intercepting unexpected or unauthorized wireless activity along borders, coastlines or harbours, as an indicator of potential illegal activity such as illegal entry or trafficking of people or goods.",

        "text": "Processed RFeye network data accessed via RFeye Monitor web browser interface\n\nRFeye Monitor is an integrated, fully configurable system for collecting and managing spectrum data using a network of widely distributed nodes. It is aimed at national regulators and other spectrum stakeholders who require accurate and current data to support planning and operational decision-making. It provides up-to-the-minute information about spectrum usage, occupancy, events and violations, across all measured spectrum, as well as fully programmable\nalarms and campaigns. A highly efficient database and web portal interface provides streamlined data access. The whole system is designed for data security and integrity, optimal system speed and convenience of user interface.\n\nRFeye Map is a mobile spectrum monitoring system for collection, management and analysis of very large spectrum data sets. It produces detailed maps of spectrum usage from national level down to individual street locations enabling national regulators or spectrum site operations to understand and anticipate \"pinch\" points and vulnerabilities, monitor compliance, identify and monitor trends over the long term. It provides a unique view of spectrum usage that can greatly inform policy and improve planning and decision-making.\n\n\nWide area spectrum survey data aggregated in RFeye Map\n\nContact us\n\nPlease contact us to discuss your specific application or requirements, to request a product demonstration or receive a quotation.
