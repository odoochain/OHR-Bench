Visa Application for Study in China (JW202/201 Form) (original and photocopy)\n3. Passport (original and photocopy). If passport has been renewed after application, be prepared to show both the old and new passport upon registration at Tsinghua. It is recommended to bring 8 recently taken passport-style photos ( 2 inches, with a white background), which may be required for school administrative formalities.\n4. Students under 18 years old should provide a \"China Guardian Certificate\" (to be obtained once in China). Chinese name: 在华监护人公证书.\n5. Highest diploma and degree certificate (original copy)\n6. Foreigner Physical Examination Form. For students who have not completed the examination form, they can go to the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center Haidian branch to complete the examination. Refer to the Physical Examination Authentication section on page 12 of this Guide.\n* Note: In addition to the above documents, other materials may be required for each individual depending on the degree or non-degree program. Refer to relevant notices received before entering the university.\n\n(2) Visa\n\nAccording to related regulations, international students coming to study in China should apply for an X1 visa (for a study period of more than 180 days), or an X2 visa (for a study period of less than 180 days). Without the correct student visa, students will not be able to register at the university.

        "text": "Visa Application\n\nAccording to Chinese law, it is not possible to apply for a visa or change visas by entering Mainland China using a visa-free entry. Do not use a visa-free entry to enter into China.\n\n1. For students applying for a visa from outside of\n\nChina, please carefully research visa types, and read the description below:\na. X1 Visa: The X1 visa generally permits only one entry, and students must register at the university within 30 days after entry in order to apply for the required residence permit, otherwise it constitutes illegal residence. Since the university does not accept students registering in advance of the scheduled date, and it usually takes 3 -5 working days to prepare the residence permit application, it is suggested that international students holding an X1 visa should have at least one week remaining on their visa before its expiry date at the time of registration at the university.\nb. X2 Visa: The number of entries and the duration of stay permitted per entry are both indicated on the X2 visa. Once international students on an X 2 visa enter the country, they should keep in mind the permitted duration of their stay on their visa and must register at the university within the time limit specified.\n* Please note that entry into Mainland China from Hong Kong S.A.R., Macao S.A.R., or China Taiwan is considered as one entry.\n2. Regarding visa collection: When picking up one's passport containing the visa for China, please ensure that the Embassy or Consulate returns the original copy of the Admission Notice and the Visa Application for Study in China (JW202/201 Form). These are important and required documents for international students for their study, residence permit application and other procedures whilst in China.\n\nPassport Nationality Used at Registration\n1. The nationality of the passport used by the international student when registering at the university should be consistent with the nationality listed when applying to study at the university, otherwise they will not be able to register.\n2. For international students who have both foreign nationality and a residence identity from Hong Kong, Macao or China Taiwan, if they applied to the university under their foreign nationality they must not register at the university using travel documents for Hong Kong, Macao and China Taiwan (such as the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents and the Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents).\n\nTravel Planning\n\nThe university arranges specific registration dates for all international students to register at the university. Advance registration is not available. International students whose visa, stay permit or residence permit has expired or will expire in too short a time to go through the registration formalities will not be permitted to register at the university. Therefore, travel planning is essential. Please do not enter into China too early in advance before the designated university registration period to avoid the risk\nof the entry visa expiring before registration, which will lead to an inability to register at the university or other difficulties.\n\nIn addition, after registration, international students applying for a residence permit will be without their passport for approximately 3-4 weeks while it is being processed. International students holding an X2 visa, who after registration need to apply for an extension or increase of the number of entries on their visa, will be without their passport for approximately 3-4 weeks.",

        "text": "Rejection of Admission Offer\n\nIf an international student decides to renounce their admission offer from the university, he or she can not use the documents issued by the university to apply for a visa, nor use that visa to enter China. According to Chinese government regulations, after the university registration period has concluded, the university will report all unregistered international students to the Division of Exit and Entry Administration of the Beijing Public Security Bureau.\n\nIf a student holds a visa to study in China but does not register at the university they have been admitted to, the visa may be cancelled and the individual will be penalized for making an illegal stay.\n\nVisa Breaches and Penalties\n\nIt is illegal to stay in China after a visa, stay permit or residence permit has expired. Those committing such an offense will be subject to a fine of 500 RMB per day and will face detainment or deportation.\n\n3 Physical Examination\n\nAll international students must submit the completed Foreigner Physical Examination Form. Below are the two options for how the physical examination can be completed.\n\n1.Complete the Foreigner Physical Examination in home country\n\nThe Foreigner Physical Examination Form is included in the admission package that will be sent to students in the mail prior to arrival at the university. The student can take the form to a hospital or clinic in their home country. The form should be written, signed and stamped by the doctor conducting the examination. The original form must then be brought to China (including the original blood test reports) and presented at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center - Haidian branch for authentication. The student will then receive a Physical Examination Report after authentication is approved. If the health documents provided do not meet the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center's standards, the student must redo the health examination at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center.\n\n2.Complete the Foreigner Physical Examination after arrival in Beijing\n\nAfter arriving in China, students can undergo the physical examination at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center - Haidian branch to obtain the Physical Examination Report. More information can be found by referring to the Physical Examination Authentication section, on page 12 of this Guide.\n\n4 Converting Money\n\nExchanging Foreign Currency\n\nIn China, only banks are authorized to provide legal exchange services of foreign currencies. Before trying to exchange foreign currency, check with bank service personnel whether the bank is able to provide the exchange service for the required foreign currency. Sometimes it is necessary to make an appointment in advance (usually one working day in advance). NonChinese citizens can exchange no more than 500 US dollars of foreign currency per day (for specific information, please consult the bank). Therefore, planning ahead is essential if a large amount of foreign currency is to be exchanged.\n\nA valid passport is required to be presented at the bank when exchanging foreign currency. Be mindful that the exchange rate of different banks is different, and that the exchange rate fluctuates in real time throughout the day.\n\nWire Transfers\n\nAs banks require several days to complete a wire transfer, it is recommended that students bring a sufficient amount of cash with them to China to pay for the first month's living expenses.\n\nCash Withdrawal Limit\n\nBanks impose a daily withdrawal limit on credit and debit cards. Students should confirm the daily limit of their personal credit card/debit card within China with their bank before departure.",

Refer to the Climate section on page 29 of this Guide for more details. For shoes, running shoes and sandals should be brought.\n\nIt is recommended that students bring often-used personal health and sanitary items such as cold and flu and stomach medicine, face towel, pillowcase, low power hair dryer and basic toiletries.\n\nBring any personal study items such as a laptop computer, and an electronic translation dictionary. Pens and other items can be bought at supermarkets on-campus.\n\nPower plug adaptors: Bring both the three-prong type and two-prong type adaptors (Chinese power voltage is 220 V ).\n\n6 Accommodation\n\nDue to the limited amount of accommodation available on campus, students should reserve a dormitory in advance. For more information, please refer to the Instructions for Tsinghua University International Students Dormitory Room Booking Application System (included in the admission package). For those who could not reserve accommodation on-campus, they will need to make their own housing arrangements off campus. Students who will receive the Chinese Government Scholarship (full scholarship), or students who have been selected to live in the Asian Youth Center will automatically be reserved a room, and therefore do not need to reserve a room themselves.\n\nOn-Campus Living\nThe Tsinghua University International Student Apartments are the Zijing Apartment Buildings 19-23, and the Asian Youth Exchange Center (Building 6). There are three different room arrangements: double rooms, single rooms and \"AB\" rooms (with separate bedrooms and a shared bathroom). Double rooms are 40 RMB per day and the single and \"AB\" rooms are 80 RMB per day.\nThe dormitories are each equipped with a desk, bed and\ncloset. A mattress, quilt, pillow and bed linen are also provided. There are specific times for the use of hot water for showering in the dormitories, which are as follows: 7:00am - 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm - 12:00am each day. Each year, the air conditioning system for the buildings is turned on between June $1^{t z}$ and September $30^{\\text {th }}$, and the heating system is turned on between November $15^{\\text {th }}$ and March $15^{\\text {th }}$. Each building has its own public spaces for use by students, such as a study lounge, workshop space, multi-purpose room, light sports space (facilities vary from building to building). Also, apart from the $A B$ rooms in building 20 that have a small room kitchen, all buildings have communal kitchens. Students need to use their own cooking utensils and supplies. All buildings are equipped with public washing machines, and some buildings also have dryers.\n\nAccording to school regulations, the Zijing Apartment Buildings $19-23$ are for international students. Friends or family members are allowed to visit, but they must first register at the reception desk on the ground floor of the building after presenting their valid ID document. Guests are not permitted to stay overnight, and can visit between the hours of 8:00am and 11:00pm.\n\nStudents residing in the dormitories must abide by the dormitory rules and regulations stipulated in the Tsinghua University Administrative Measures for International Student Dormitory Accommodation. The measures include that that smoking indoors and the use of cooking appliances in areas other than the common kitchens are prohibited in the apartment buildings, and that the following objects are prohibited for being used or stored in the apartments: electric vehicle batteries and chargers (including scooter batteries), immersion heaters, electric blankets, electric water heaters, electric heaters or open flames such as candles. In the event of illegal residence in the apartment, the charging of electric vehicle batteries, non-residents staying in the apartment ovemight, or the use of prohibited electrical appliances of the causing of a fire, the student's right to accommodation will be forfeit.\n\nOff-Campus Living\nDue to the limited amount of on-campus accommodation, some students will need to find accommodation off campus. Students who do not have a dormitory room reserved on campus can choose to rent an apartment off campus. Before moving in to any off-campus accommodation, it should be checked whether the landlord can provide the documentation required for the issuing of a Registration Form of Temporary Residence ( 临时住宿登记表).\n\nThere are many housing agencies located near the Tsinghua campus. Their services and prices offered should be compared in advance. Below are some factors to be aware of when looking for off-campus accommodation:\n1. Choose a legal, reputable housing agency.

Do not simply trust the introduction given by the housing agent. Make sure to inspect the apartment room, its facilities and the surrounding area in person.\n3. Check and verify the landlord's credentials and property credentials, including whether the property has the right to be rented out. If signing a lease through a third-party agent, check the agency agreement and understand the agency's terms and conditions and their right to sign the contract.\n4. Carefully read through the conditions outlined in the rental contract and check whether the rights and obligations of the two parties are fair. Take note of whether the responsibility for a specific breach of contract is clearly defined and ensure that all commitments are written and signed off by the agent in the contract, not simply conveyed by spoken word.\n5. Pay attention and check through the information provided in receipts given, including the deposit amount and rental fee, and keep safe official documents and payment receipts. Note that in Chinese, one should pay attention to the contract and invoices when the term \"dingjin\" is used, as there are two types of \"dingjin\" in Chinese. The first is \"定金\" (dingjīn), which is a type of deposit/advance payment that you can get back should you choose to exit out of the contract, and the second is 订金 (dingjin), which is a type of deposit/advance payment that you cannot get back once paid.\n6. Do not pay any deposit or make a payment until a full agreement is formally reached.\n7.

Do not carry around large amounts of money. Take appropriate care of important items such as passports, admission notices, phones, laptops and wallets.\n- Be aware of telecommunications fraud. Do not give information to unknown people by phone, text, WeChat or online. Do not transfer money or write checks to unknown accounts or individuals.\n- Pay attention to information safety. Do not carelessly disclose one's personal information. If necessary, the police can be contacted via phone by calling 110.",

        "text": "Paying attention to traffic safety and obeying traffic regulations\n- Do not ride in unlicensed vehicles, or with unfamiliar individuals.\n- The university does not encourage students or parents to drive cars into the university. Also, students are not permitted to apply for a motorized vehicle pass in campus. Motorized vehicles are forbidden from entering the student dormitory areas. The university does not recommend students to purchase electric vehicles (including scooters).\n- The primary mode of on-campus transportation is by bicycle (either personal bicycles or shared bikes). Bicycles should be locked after use. When walking or cycling on campus, please use the pavement or lanes for non-motorized vehicles. Do not ride in a dangerous manner, such as riding the wrong way down a roadway, speeding, or turning without signaling.\n\nAwareness of dormitory safety and prevention of theft or fire\n- Do not leave large amounts of cash; student IC card; keys or other important and valuable objects out in one's room. Either keep them safely locked away or on one's person.\n- Obey dormitory regulations. When leaving the student dormitory room or resting inside the dormitory, lock the windows and door and do not let others stay in the room. When entering a dormitory building, make sure that others do not sneak in behind. Take an active role to prevent the subleasing of dormitory rooms by reporting such situations to the building staff or security staff.\n- Be careful when using electricity inside the dormitory. The connecting, disconnecting, or pulling of electrical wires without permission is strictly forbidden. It is also forbidden to use electrical devices that go against regulations, as well as open flames such as candles or mosquito-repellant incense. Smoking in the dormitories is forbidden. Take care to prevent any potential fires from occurring. Become familiar with dormitory emergency exits and evacuation routes. When there is a fire, promptly raise the alarm and exit the building.\n\nAvoiding injuries whilst exercising\n- Avoid strenuous exercise and stay hydrated. Rest when feeling tired, hungry or uncomfortable.\n- When exercising, dress according to the season and time of day.\n- Those with illnesses should choose exercise methods that suit their physical condition.\n- To avoid injury, do warm-up exercises beforehand and recovery exercises afterwards. Choose suitable exercise equipment.\n- If one is injured during exercise, stop exercising and rest sufficiently. Recovery exercises should be performed until the injury heals. If necessary, see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nStaying safe while shopping online\n- When choosing a specific online shopping website, first compare information such as volume of trade and customer reviews. Businesses that have an offlinestore or a seven-day returns policy can better guarantee customer rights and are more reliable.\n- Use third-party payment platforms to minimize the risk of transaction issues. Keep hold of proof of transactions, such as records of communication, delivery numbers and evidence of payments.\n- After receiving the purchased item, open and inspect the package immediately. If the product is not the same as was advertised or there is a problem with its quality, the recipient has the right to reject the delivery. If there is the option, do not click \"confirm delivery\" ( 确认收货 ) if the item has not yet arrived or is unsatisfactory.\n* Note: Most of the information in this section is from the University Students' Safety Knowledge Manual.",

Licensed taxis are normally of the same design and should have the taxi company logo displayed. Different cities have different starting prices, but all are relatively affordable. Be careful not to ride in unlicensed taxis. Check the taxi company, driver and vehicle information (usually posted above the\nfront passenger seat) and check whether there is a taxi meter fitted and in operation (in Chinese: 打表计费).\n- Taxi fare fee\n\nThe standard taxi fare is 2.30 RMB per kilometer. The flag-down starting rate is 13 RMB (within the first 3 kilometers). The taxi fare fee may be a slightly higher rate when in traffic jams and during evenings.\n- Confirming that a taxi is a licensed taxi When taking a taxi, first check the car license plate. Licensed taxis in Beijing should all have a car license plate beginning with the letter B . Always ask for the receipt when getting out of the taxi.\n\nSubway and Light Rail Network\nThe Beijing Subway and Light Rail Network (apart from the airport express train) is a highly connected transportation network. Prices depend on the distance travelled and range from 3 to 7 RMB per journey. Tickets can be purchased at the ticket window or by using the automatic machines found at all subway stations. A rechargeable Beijing transportation card can also be purchased, which is used by most people who frequently travel via public\n29",

The nearest bus stop to the student dormitories is the stop located by the north-east gate, where bus number 549 travels to the nearby areas of Wudaokou and Zhongguancun. For more information, visit: http://www. bjbus.com.\n\n3 Wudaokou and Surrounds\n\nThe Wudaokou area is a student-hub, as it is located near several universities, including Tsinghua. The busiest and most bustling part of Wudaokou is centered on either side of the Wudaokou subway station. Traffic jams are common, especially during peak hour and thus attention should be paid to personal safety.\nThe Wudaokou area has an international atmosphere and is filled with shops, restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The main department store in Wudaokou, known as the $U$ Center, is home to clothing and lifestyle stores, a pharmacy and the BHG supermarket on the basement floor housing many international products. Nearby, there is also D-Mart a smaller international supermarket, and Lotus supermarket - a large local supermarket chain.\n\nNearby the Wudaokou subway station are bus stops that can take you back to the north-east gate of Tsinghua University (bus number 549) and several buses going in the direction of nearby Peking University and Zhongguancun, Beijing's technology hub.\nDue to its close proximity to Tsinghua University, many students living off campus choose to live in apartment blocks located in Wudaokou. Apart from Wudaokou, there is also a nearby area called Liudaokou (六道口), where many\nstudents also choose to live. It has its own subway station of the same name on line 15, the Golden Towers shopping market, and a large variety of Chinese restaurants.\n(4.
