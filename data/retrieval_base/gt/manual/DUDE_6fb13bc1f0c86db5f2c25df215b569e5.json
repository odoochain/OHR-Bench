It makes this solution completely undetectable by the targets or the operators unlike active interception solutions in the markets. Thanks to its dense FPGA architecture, this solution is able to intercept up to 60000 communications per hour, which enables this solution to be suited for massive application (border control for example), the go2INTERCEPT (passive) is able to demodulate and decipher in real time up to 320 duplex communication.\n\n\nTwo versions of go2INTERCEPT (passive) are available either in a 2 U format for low cost application (up to 20 full duplex simulta-neous communication) or in a 3 U format to get the full power of the systems.\n\nThe front end can be connected to the deciphering box (go2DECIPHER) through ethernet connection using either Vsat, 3G or cable links.

        "text": "go2INTERCEPT\n\nDescription\ngo2INTERCEPT (active extended) is designed to perform man-in-the-middle attacks for mobile phones over GSM (2G, 2.5G) and UMTS (3G) networks.\n\nThe system emulates a real cell (base station) attempting the surrounding phones to select and register to the fake cell. As a result, the system becomes the serving cell of the surrounding phones (all pho-\nnes or only designated phones) and consequently controls the phones communication.\n\nAs such, the system is used to extract the target identity, to track the target location, to monitor the target communication and to manipulate the target phone in advanced methods.\n\nTypical applications\n\nCalls and SMS interception\n\ngo2INTERCEPT (active extended) conducts seamless interception of target inbound and outbound and SMS over GSM networks with-out cooperation or authorization from the GSM operator. The system can monitor as much targets as required and handle multiple live calls simultaneously.\n\nCalls and SMS manipulations\n\nBesides of monitoring the target calls and SMS, the system allows to manipulate the target communication in various ways:\n\n- Block or disconnect specific or all calls and SMS-messages of any target.\n- Send fake SMS messages (fake content and fake identity) to the target or on behalf of the target.\n- Reroute calls and SMS from/to the target.\n- Change SMS content that was sent from/to the target.\n\nIMSI and IMEI extraction\n\nThe system allows to extract the identity of any phone in the area and also to alert about the presence of specific phones or targets in a certain area.\n\nDenial-of-service\n\nThe system can block the communication of all phones in a certain area or to block the communication of only specific phones.\n\nFind a target\n\nThe system force the phone to transmit a seamless signal. The phone signal is tracked by a dedicated receiver and allows getting closer to the target till final resolution of its position.\n\n3G (UMTS) handling\n\nSince interception is not possible over 3G networks, the 3 G module generates a signal to the 3G phones that cause them to move to the GSM network.\n\nOnce the phone moves to the GSM network, the GSM module takes over and conducts the interception of the target as well as all other actions that are described above.\n\nIMSI and IMEI extraction\n\nThe system allows to extract the identity of any phone in the area and also to alert about the presence of specific phones or targets in a certain area.",

It is possible to change the emulated network on the fly. If there is a need to work on several networks in parallel or the networks are using different bands, then several GSM modules are required in the system.\n\n3G (UMTS) module\n\nEach 3G module works on a specific band (e.g. $850,1900,2100 \\mathrm{MHz}$ ) and can emulate one 3G network at a time.

If there is a need to work on several networks in parallel or the networks are using different bands and/or multiple UMTS channels, then several UMTS modules are required in the system.\n\nRouting modems\n\nThe modems in the system are used to reroute the calls of the target to the real GSM network and vice versa, in order to conduct full and seamless interception of the targets' inbound and outbound calls and SMS.\n\nSoftware application and UI (User Interface)\n\nInstalled on a standard laptop, the software (SW) management application allows conducting all tasks related to the system, to monitor in real time the intercepted calls and to record all calls and interrogated information. The SW application includes also a back-office that presents all logged data and conduct applicable queries on the collected data.\n\nInternal power amplifiers\n\nTo boost the transmission signal of the system, the system includes 4W integrated power amplifiers per each GSM module and 25W integrated power amplifiers per each 3G module.",

The selection of antennas depends on the operation scenario and the system setup such as magnetic omni-antennas when patrolling with a vehicle in and urban area or hi-gain directional antenna installed on a tripod or mast in a long-range operation.\n\nSystem specifications\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\n  Technical parameters & Value \\\\\n  GSM frequency bands & $850,900,1800,1900 \\mathrm{MHz}$ \\\\\n  3G frequency bands & $850,1900,2100 \\mathrm{MHz}$ \\\\\n  Simultaneous duplex channels & 4,6 or more \\\\\n  Simultaneous GSM BTS & 2 or more \\\\\n  Simultaneous 3G BaseStations & 2 or more \\\\\n  Interception of outbound calls & Yes \\\\\n  Interception of inbound calls & Yes \\\\\n  Interception of outbound SMS & Yes \\\\\n  Interception of inbound SMS & Yes \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\n  Technical parameters & Value \\\\\n  Detected identities & IMSI, IMEI, MSISDN \\\\\n  Voice codec types & LPT-RPE, FR, EFR, HR, AMR \\\\\n  Random \\& Target Mode & Yes \\\\\n  DTMF tones interception & Yes \\\\\n  Ability to handle 3G phones & Yes \\\\\n  Ability to locate target phones & Yes \\\\\n  Ability to change SMS content & Yes \\\\\n  Ability to interrupt calls & Yes \\\\\n  Ability to prevent calls & Yes \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",
