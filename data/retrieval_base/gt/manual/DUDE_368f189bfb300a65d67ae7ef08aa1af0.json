By registering names within the new domain co-operatives can:\n- Differentiate their businesses from a sea of .coms and add value to their web site.\n- Gain from the consumer trust cooperatives have built over the last 150 years.\n- Promote their co-operative identity on the web.\n- Register for the meaningful, memorable internet addresses that weren't available under .com and\n- Increase their internet exposure and web site traffic by using multiple names to point to their site.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nOnly co-operatives, co-operative support organisations and businesses owned by co-operatives are eligible to register.\n\nHow is eligibility verified? Registrants are asked to identify two cooperative organisations to which they belong or which may be able to affirm their co-operative status. Some registrants will be verified automatically by the system while others may be asked to submit additional documentation.\n\nWhere do Co-operatives Register?\nGo to www.australia.coop and click on the registration link.\n\nBackground\n\nSeptember 2000\n\nThe National Cooperative Business Association and Poptel, with the support of the International Cooperative Alliance, applied to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for approval of the coop domain and authority to sponsor the domain and offer registry services.\nNovember 2000\nICANN approved .coop, along with six other new top-level domains, to join .com, .org and .net on the Internet.\nMay 2001\nNCBA formed its subsidiary dotCoop to operate the domain. Poptel continued with the technical registry build.\nNovember 2001\nICANN and dotCoop finalised the contract allowing dotCoop to operate the new domain.\nDecember 2001\nU.S. Department of Commerce approved the ICANN/dotCoop contract. IANA recommended entry of .coop into the Internet's root server.\nJanuary 2002\n.Coop went live on the Internet on January 9. Registration opened to all cooperatives worldwide on January 30.\n\nCo-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd\n71 Franciscan Avenue\nFrankston VIC 3199\nAUSTRALIA\nPhone: (61 03) 97856704\nFax: (61 03) 97856542\nEmail: cfedv@impaq.com.au\nWebsite: http://www.australia.coop",
