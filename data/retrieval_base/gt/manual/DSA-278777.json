Byte-processing and numerical operations on small data structures are facilitated by a variety of fast addressing modes for accessing the internal RAM. The instruction set provides a convenient menu of 8 -bit arithmetic instructions, including multiply and divide instructions. Extensive on-chip support is provided for one-bit variables as a separate data type, allowing direct bit manipulation and testing in control and logic systems that require Boolean processing.\n\nThe 8751 H is an EPROM version of the 8051 AH . It has 4 Kbytes of electrically programmable ROM which can be erased with ultraviolet light. It is fully compatible with the 8051 AH but incorporates one additional feature: a Program Memory Security bit that can be used to protect the EPROM against unauthorized readout. The $8751 \\mathrm{H}-8$ is identical to the 8751 H but only operates up to 8 MHz .\n\nThe 8051 AHP is identical to the 8051 AH with the exception of the Protection Feature. To incorporate this Protection Feature, program verification has been disabled and external memory accesses have been limited to 4 K .\n\nThe 8052 AH is an enhanced version of the 8051 AH . It is backwards compatible with the 8051 AH and is fabricated with HMOS II technology. The 8052AH enhancements are listed in the table below. Also refer to this table for the ROM, ROMless and EPROM versions of each product.\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow{2}{*}{ Device } & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ Internal Memory } & \\multirow{2}{*}{Timers/ Event Counters} & Interrupts \\\\\n\\cline { 2 - 3 } & \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Program } & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Data } & & \\\\\n  8031 AH & none & $128 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $2 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 5 \\\\\n8051 AH & $4 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{ROM}$ & $128 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $2 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 5 \\\\\n8051 AHP & $4 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{ROM}$ & $128 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $2 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 5 \\\\\n8751 H & $4 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{EPROM}$ & $128 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $2 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 5 \\\\\n$8751 \\mathrm{H}-8$ & $4 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{EPROM}$ & $128 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $2 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 5 \\\\\n8751 BH & $4 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{EPROM}$ & $128 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $2 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 5 \\\\\n8032 AH & none & $256 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $3 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 6 \\\\\n8052 AH & $8 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{ROM}$ & $256 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $3 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 6 \\\\\n8752 BH & $8 \\mathrm{~K} \\times 8 \\mathrm{EPROM}$ & $256 \\times 8 \\mathrm{RAM}$ & $3 \\times 16-\\mathrm{Bit}$ & 6 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",

External pullups are required during program verification.\n\nPort 1: Port 1 is an 8 -bit bidirectional 1/O port with internal pullups. The Port 1 output buffers can sink/ source 4 LS TTL inputs. Port 1 pins that have 1's written to them are pulled high by the internal pullups, and in that state can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 1 pins that are externally pulled low will source current (IIL on the data sheet) because of the internal pullups.\n\nPort 1 also receives the low-order address bytes during programming of the EPROM parts and during program verification of the ROM and EPROM parts.\n\nIn the 8032AH, 8052AH and 8752BH, Port 1 pins P1.0 and P1.1 also serve the T2 and T2EX functions, respectively.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n  Port Pin & Alternative Function \\\\\n  P1.0 & T2 (Timer/Counter 2 External Input) \\\\\n  P1.1 & T2EX (Timer/Counter 2 Capture/Reload Trigger) \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nPort 2: Port 2 is an 8 -bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pullups.

As inputs, Port 2 pins that are externally pulled low will source current (IIL on the data sheet) because of the internal pullups.\n\nPort 2 emits the high-order address byte during fetches from external Program Memory and during accesses to external Data Memory that use 16 -bit addresses (MOVX @DPTR). In this application it uses strong internal pullups when emitting 1's. During accesses to external Data Memory that use 8 -bit addresses (MOVX @Ri), Port 2 emits the contents of the P2 Special Function Register.\n\nPort 2 also receives the high-order address bits during programming of the EPROM parts and during program verification of the ROM and EPROM parts.\n\nThe protection feature of the 8051AHP causes bits P2.4 through P2.7 to be forced to 0 , effectively limiting external Data and Code space to 4 K each during external accesses.\n\nPort 3: Port 3 is an 8 -bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pullups. The Port 3 output buffers can sink/ source 4 LS TTL inputs. Port 3 pins that have 1's written to them are pulled high by the internal pullups, and in that state can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 3 pins that are externally pulled low will source current ( $I_{1}$ on the data sheet) because of the pullups.\n\nPort 3 also serves the functions of various special features of the MCS 51 Family, as listed below:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}\n  Port Pin & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Alternative Function } \\\\\n  P3.0 & RXD (serial input port) \\\\\nP3.1 & TXD (serial output port) \\\\\nP3.2 & $\\overline{\\text { INT0 }}$ (external interrupt 0) \\\\\nP3.3 & $\\overline{\\text { INT1 }}$ (external interrupt 1) \\\\\nP3.4 & T0 (Timer 0 external input) \\\\\nP3.5 & T1 (Timer 1 external input) \\\\\nP3.6 & WR (external data memory write strobe) \\\\\nP3.7 & $\\overline{\\text { RD }}$ (external data memory read strobe) \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nRST: Reset input.

Oscillator Connections\nXTAL1: Input to the inverting oscillator amplifier.\nXTAL2: Output from the inverting oscillator amplifier.\n\nOSCILLATOR CHARACTERISTICS\nXTAL1 and XTAL2 are the input and output, respectively, of an inverting amplifier which can be configured for use as an on-chip oscillator, as shown in Figure 3. Either a quartz crystal or ceramic resonator may be used. More detailed information concerning the use of the on-chip oscillator is available in Application Note AP-155, \"Oscillators for Microcontrollers,\" Order No. 230659.\n\nTo drive the device from an external clock source, XTAL1 should be grounded, while XTAL2 is driven, as shown in Figure 4. There are no requirements on the duty cycle of the external clock signal, since the input to the internal clocking circuitry is through a divide-by-two flip-flop, but minimum and maximum high and low times specified on the data sheet must be observed.\n\nFigure 4. External Drive Configuration\n\nEXPRESS Version\nThe Intel EXPRESS system offers enhancements to the operational specifications of the MCS 51 family of microcontrollers. These EXPRESS products are designed to meet the needs of those applications whose operating requirements exceed commercial standards.\n\nThe EXPRESS program includes the commercial standard temperature range with burn-in, and an extended temperature range with or without burn-in.\n\nWith the commercial standard temperature range, operational characteristics are guaranteed over the temperature range of $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $+70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. With the extended temperature range option, operational characteristics are guaranteed over a range of $-40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $+85^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe optional burn-in is dynamic, for a minimum time of 160 hours at $125^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ with $V_{C C}=5.5 \\mathrm{~V} \\pm 0.25 \\mathrm{~V}$, following guidelines in MIL-STD-883, Method 1015.\n\nPackage types and EXPRESS versions are identified by a one- or two-letter prefix to the part number. The prefixes are listed in Table 1.\n\nFor the extended temperature range option, this data sheet specifies the parameters which deviate from their commercial temperature range limits.\n5",

Note that the $V_{I H}$ and $I_{I H}$ specifications for the $\\overline{E A}$ pin differ significantly between the devices.\n- Exposure to light when the EPROM device is in operation may cause logic errors. For this reason, it is suggested that an opaque label be placed over the window when the die is exposed to ambient light.\n- The 8051AHP cannot access external Program or Data memory above 4 K . This means that the following instructions that use the Data Pointer only read/write data at address locations below OFFFH:\n\nMOVX A,@DPTR\nMOVX @DPIR, A\nWhen the Data Pointer contains an address above the 4 K limit, those locations will not be accessed.\n\nTo access Data Memory above 4 K , the MOVX @Ri,A or MOVX A,@Ri instructions must be used.",

(The reason the oscillator needs to be running is that the internal bus is being used to transfer address and program data to appropriate internal registers.) The address of an EPROM location to be programmed is applied to Port 1 and pins P2.0-P2.3 of Port 2, while the code byte to be programmed into that location is applied to Port 0. The other Port 2 pins, and RST, $\\overline{\\text { PSEN, }}$, and EA/Vpp should be held at the \"Program\" levels indicated in Table 3. ALE/PROG is pulsed low for 50 ms to program the code byte into the addressed EPROM location. The setup is shown in Figure 5.\n\nNormally $\\overline{E A} / V_{\\text {pp }}$ is held at a logic high until just before ALE/PROG is to be pulsed. Then EA/VPP is raised to $+21 \\mathrm{~V}, \\mathrm{ALE} / \\overline{\\mathrm{PROG}}$ is pulsed, and then $E A / V_{P P}$ is returned to a logic high. Waveforms and detailed timing specifications are shown in later sections of this data sheet.\n\nFigure 5. Programming Configuration\n\"VPP\" = + 21V $\\pm 0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$\n*ALE is pulsed low for 50 ms .\n\nNote that the EA/VPP pin must not be allowed to go above the maximum specified VPP level of 21.5 V for any amount of time. Even a narrow glitch above that voltage level can cause permanent damage to the device. The VPP source should be well regulated and free of glitches.\n\nProgram Verification\nIf the Security Bit has not been programmed, the onchip Program Memory can be read out for verification purposes, if desired, either during or after the programming operation. The address of the Program Memory location to be read is applied to Port 1 and pins P2.0-P2.3. The other pins should be held at the \"Verify\" levels indicated in Table 3. The contents of the addressed location will come out on Port 0. External pullups are required on Port 0 for this operation.\n\nThe setup, which is shown in Figure 6, is the same as for programming the EPROM except that pin P2.7 is held at a logic low, or may be used as an activelow read strobe.\n\nFigure 6.

        "text": "intel.\nMCS* 51 CONTROLLER\n\nEPROM Security\nThe security feature consists of a \"locking\" bit which when programmed denies electrical access by any external means to the on-chip Program Memory. The bit is programmed as shown in Figure 7. The setup and procedure are the same as for normal EPROM programming, except that P2.6 is held at a logic high. Port 0, Port 1 and pins P2.0-P2.3 may be in any state. The other pins should be held at the \"Security\" levels indicated in Table 3.\n\nOnce the Security Bit has been programmed, it can be cleared only by full erasure of the Program Memory. While it is programmed, the internal Program Memory can not be read out, the device can not be further programmed, and it can not execute out of external program memory. Erasing the EPROM, thus clearing the Security Bit, restores the device's full functionality. It can then be reprogrammed.\n\nErasure Characteristics\nErasure of the EPROM begins to occur when the device is exposed to light with wavelengths shorter than approximately 4,000 Angstroms. Since sunlight and fluorescent lighting have wavelengths in this range, exposure to these light sources over an extended time (about 1 week in sunlight, or 3 years in room-level fluorescent lighting) could cause inadvertent erasure. If an application subjects the device to this type of exposure, it is suggested that an opaque label be placed over the window.\n\nFigure 7. Programming the Security Bit\nThe recommended erasure procedure is exposure to ultraviolet light (at 2537 Angstroms) to an integrated dose of at least 15 W -sec/ $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Exposing the EPROM to an ultraviolet lamp of $12,000 \\mu \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ rating for 20 to 30 minutes, at a distance of about 1 inch, should be sufficient.\n\nErasure leaves the array in an all 1's state.\n\nEPROM PROGRAMMING AND VERIFICATION CHARACTERISTICS\n$T_{A}=21^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $27^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} ; \\mathrm{VCC}=5 \\mathrm{~V} \\pm 10 \\% ; \\mathrm{VSS}=\\mathrm{OV}$\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  Symbol & Parameter & Min & Max & Units \\\\\n  VPP & Programming Supply Voltage & 20.5 & 21.5 & V \\\\\n  IPP & Programming Supply Current & & 30 & mA \\\\\n  1/TCLCL & Oscillator Frequency & 4 & 6 & MHz \\\\\n  TAVGL & Address Setup to PROG Low & 48TCLCL & & \\\\\n  TGHAX & Address Hold after PROG & 48 TCLCL & & \\\\\n  TDVGL & Data Setup to PROG Low & 48 TCLCL & & \\\\\n  TGHDX & Data Hold after PROG & 48 TCLCL & & \\\\\n  TEHSH & P2.7 (ENABLE) High to VPP & 48 TCLCL & & \\\\\n  TSHGL & VPP Setup to $\\overline{\\text { PROG }}$ Low & 10 & & $\\mu \\mathrm{s}$ \\\\\n  TGHSL & VPP Hold after PROG & 10 & & $\\mu \\mathrm{s}$ \\\\\n  TGLGH & PROG Width & 45 & 55 & ms \\\\\n  TAVQV & Address to Data Valid & & 48 TCLCL & \\\\\n  TELQV & ENABBLE Low to Data Valid & & 48 TCLCL & \\\\\n  TEHQZ & Data Float after ENABLE & 0 & 48 TCLCL & \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n15",

ALE/PROG is pulsed low for $100 \\mu$ seconds, 25 times as shown in Figure 9. Then, the byte just programmed may be verified. After programming, the entire array should be verified. The Program Lock features are programmed using the same method, but with the setup as shown in Table 4. The only difference in programming Lock features is that the Lock features cannot be directly verified. Instead, verification of programming is by observing that their features are enabled.\n\nPROGRAM VERIFICATION\nIf the Lock Bits have not been programmed, the onchip Program Memory can be read out for verification purposes, if desired, either during or after the programming operation. The address of the Program Memory location to be read is applied to Port 1 and pins P2.0 - P2.4. The other pins should be held at the \"Verify\" levels indicated in Table 1.
