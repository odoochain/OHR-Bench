FOREWORD\n\n0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution on 3 August 1966, after the draft finalized by the Dairy Industry Sectional Committee had been approved by the Agricultural and Food Products Division Council.\n0.2 The farm milk cooling tank is intended to cool and store milk. For the purpose of this standard it has been assumed that the farm milk cooling tank will be subjected to an ambient temperature of $43^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.\n\n1. SCOPE\n1.1 This standard lays down requirements of design, construction and performance for farm milk cooling tanks in which bulk milk is cooled and stored. It includes the tanks which are intended for use at a place where electricity is available from mains supply or from a generating set.\n\n2. CAPACITIES\n2.1 Each farm milk tank shall be designated by its rated capacity. This shall be the volume of milk which the tank is designed to operate and at which it shall be tested.\n2.1.1 The tanks should be designed to the rated capacities of 500, 1000 and 2000 litres.\n2.1.2 Actual capacities shall be determined with the tank filled to a level of 60 mm below the top edge of the inner vessel and shall agree with the corresponding nominal capacity within ${ }_{-0}^{5}$ percent.\n\n\n*Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised).",

This jacket shall house the ice-building coil (evaporator) and the space shall be sufficient to build requisite quantity of ice to meet the requirements of performance given in 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. The jacket also shall have a water inlet, water outlet, overflow pipe or air distributor pipe with connections to the air supply system, that is, blower of compressor. In a farm tank constructed for cooling milk by direct expansion, the jacket shall surround the entire bottom of the vessel and such part of the body as is required to provide the necessary heat transfer to conform to the performance requirement specified in 6.2.1 and 6.2.2.\n6.3 Prevention of Freezing of Milk - Tanks shall be so constructed and controlled that no freezing of milk takes place at any time.",
