Therefore, you are advised to purchase an official Huawei charger from an official Huawei sales outlet.\n- Use a Huawei power adapter or other power adapters that comply with local and international security standards. Adapters that do not conform to the security standard may cause security issues.\n- Keep the surface of the charging cradle clean. Make sure the watch is placed properly on the charging cradle and displaying the charging status. Avoid putting metal objects on the medal contacts of the charger too long, or repeatedly sticking and removing metal objects to the contacts, as this can result in short circuiting and other risks.

The charging cradle contains magnetic materials. It is important not to let it overheat by placing it out in the sun or somewhere too warm.\n- When carrying and storing the charging cradle, make sure the charger stays dry, especially the USB port on the base, clean it to prevent foreign objects from entering the USB port, these can cause damage to the charger and may lead to other safety risks.\n- Your watch will automatically power off when its battery level is too low. After it is charged for a while, your watch will automatically power on.\n\nCharging time\n\nYour watch will be fully charged within two hours.
