'62)\n\nEAST MINUS WEST EQUALS ZERO - Werner Keller\n\nThis industrial-scientific history of Russia explodes the widespread fiction of Soviet economic might.

        "text": "READINGS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nSOCIALISM - Ludwig von Mises\n\nA devastating refutation of every known version of socialist or collectivist economic theory. While there is much in this book with which we cannot agree, particularly in the fields of epistemology and morality, Mises' lucid dissection of socialist schemes, his demonstration of the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism and his encyclopedic exposure of the countless fallacies in collectivist economic proposals, make this work eminently worthy of careful study. Contains the epilogue PLANNED CHAOS (listed above).\n\nWHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT INFLATION - Henry Hazlitt\n\nA valuable non-technical primer. Hazlitt refutes the arguments made for inflation and demonstrates that the only effective permanent barrier to inflation is a return to the fully convertible gold standard.\n\nTHE EXPLOITATION THEORY - Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk\n\nA brilliant refutation of Karl Marx's theory that the physical labor required to produce a commodity is the sole source of the product's economic value, and of Marx's corollary claim that therefore the employer-manufacturer's profits are the result of exploiting the worker by paying him less than the commodity's value and expropriating the \"surplus value.\"\n\nPROSPERITY THROUGH FREEDOM - Lawrence Fertig\n\nA lively popularization of the basic principles of free enterprise, by the noted syndicated columnist. Especially interesting are the sections debunking Soviet claims of economic superiority, and extolling West Germany's post-war recovery under a predominantly laissez-faire economy. Despite occasional concessions to economic interventionism, Fertig provides an arsenal of factual ammunition on domestic and foreign issues for advocates of free enterprise. (Mar. '62)\n\nADVANCED READINGS IN ECONOMICS\n\nHUMAN ACTION: A Treatise on Economics Ludwig von Mises\n\nMises' most detailed and systematic treatise, presenting a comprehensive analysis of the nature and operation of a free market economy. Despite our disagreement on a number of philosophical issues, this book is enthusiastically recommended. An invaluable reference work. (Sept. '63)\n\nTHE THEORY OF MONEY AND CREDIT - Ludwig von Mises\n\nMises analyzes the nature, origins and functions of money, banking, credit and interest. Part Four, Monetary Reconstruction, defines and defends the principle of sound money and charts the steps necessary for a return to sound money.\n\nTHE FAILURE OF THE \"NEW ECONOMICS\" - Henry Hazlitt\n\nLord Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money is the backbone of the economic policies of the New Deal, Fair Deal and New Frontier. Hazlitt subjects Keynes' book to a penetrating point-by-point analysis, refuting every leading Keynesian tenet. Hazlitt also offers a positive theory of booms and depressions, and of proper government fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nTHE CRITICS OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS - Henry Hazlitt, ed.\n\nAn anthology of the best politico-economic essays written in refutation of Keynesian doctrines - including two essays, written in the 19th century, that refuted Keynes' \"New Economics\" before it was launched.\n\nECONOMICS AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE - Benjamin M. Anderson\n\nThe best financial and economic history of the United States from 1913 through 1946. Covers the creation of the Federal Reserve System and the disastrous effects of its monetary policies; the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression; Roosevelt's abandonment of the Gold Standard, the inflationary practices that followed, and the destructive impact of the New Deal on the economy.\n\nTWENTIETH CENTURY POLITICS\n\nTEN THOUSAND COMMANDMENTS - Harold Fleming\n\nA graphic and shocking expos√© of Antitrust legislation, written for the layman. Shows how a succession of non-judicable, non-objective and iniquitous laws have placed every businessman in a position where, by the fact of being in business, he can be legally branded as a criminal and persecuted by a bureaucracy with arbitrary powers. (April '62)\n\nTHE LANGUAGE OF DISSENT - Lowell B. Mason\n\nA former member of the Federal Trade Commission (who joined the FTC in order to defend free enterprise) documents this agency's arbitrary, unconstitutional and dictatorial policies toward business. (Aug. '63)\n\nTHE DECLINE OF AMERICAN LIBERALISM Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr. In the 19th century, liberalism meant the advocacy of laissez-faire capitalism; today, it means the creed of statism. Ekirch provides the evidence for understanding how these mutually antagonistic creeds share the name of liberalism and how \"statist liberalism\" arose. Though marred by errors in interpretation of economic history, this book is a highly valuable documentation of American intellectual history. (July '62)",
