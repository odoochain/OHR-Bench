        "text": "LIVE, WORK \\& PLAY IN ANCHORAGE\n\nAnchorage is a vibrant and growing city where you can live close to work, make a good living, develop a close circle of friends, and have a plethora of options for entertainment and outdoor activities.\n\nAnchorage might appear at first glance to be a typical American city, but closer exploration shows some surprising facets of urban life in Alaska. The city's 290,000 human residents share their space with an estimated 1,500 moose, not to mention bald eagles, bears, beavers, Dall sheep, and the occasional lynx.\n\nNestled between the Chugach Mountains and Cook Inlet, Anchorage is filled with parks and trails. 10,946 acres of municipal parkland and 250 miles of trails and greenbelts to be exact. It is only a short drive or walk from just about anywhere in Anchorage to a trail or park.\n\nWhile Anchorage is best known for trails and wildlife, it also has a strong cultural scene. Anchorage is home to the world-class Anchorage Museum and Alaska Native Heritage Center, and has a symphony and opera that predate statehood.\n\nAny night of the week, you can find art shows, lectures, concerts, and more.\n\nWith an abundance of local seafood and produce, fresh ingredients go into a cuisine scene that covers familiar comfort food, Thai, Himalayan, Polynesian, German, and all points in between. There are also a dozen breweries, a cidery and a handful of distilleries filling glasses in Anchorage.\n\nWhile our scenery and culture are noteworthy, it is the people who make Anchorage special. Our community is built upon the traditional homeland of the Dena'ina people who arrived in the area over a thousand years ago and continue to be leaders of our community. Today, members of other Alaska Native tribes live here as well; an estimated 7.27\\% of Anchorage's population identifies as Alaska Native.\n\nPeople from all over the U.S. and the world call Anchorage home - some who've been here for generations and others who've only just arrived. Alaskans are friendly and have a strong sense of adventure and community. It's a place where neighbors look out for each other. A place you can call home.\n\nTo learn more about Anchorage, please visit: anchorage.net/\naedcweb.com/business/relocating-anchorage/\nanchoragemuseum.org\nalaskanative.net/",

        "text": "APL 2019-21 STRATEGIC PLAN\n\nThe 2019-21 Strategic Plan focuses APL on core services and three community focus areas - education \\& skills for life, a bridge to information and resources, and building community. To carry out this plan, in 2019 the Library committed to a more intentional development of programs and services to ensure that all library activities strengthen core services and deliver outcomes in the three community focus areas.\n\nThe first step was to improve internal practices and infrastructure to ensure that we are adequately positioned to address the goals of the plan. This was accomplished by forming cross-departmental work groups to tackle projects such as internal communications, policy reviews, and staff training and development. Nine work groups undertook projects in 2019 with four new groups formed in 2020; over 35\\% of staff have participated in a work group.\n\n2019-20 Highlights\n\nThe focus on internal improvements led to improved staff satisfaction scores, an organization-wide commitment to professional development and personal growth, and the achievement of many new practices that make APL a more efficient and enjoyable place to work. The Library has a strong, cohesive, and well-trained staff that consistently delivers high quality programs and services.\n\nWe've also made strides in our public-facing work - realigning community partnerships to better address our community focus areas, eliminating overdue fines as part of our equity and inclusion lens, and improving public communications to increase usage.\n\n\n\nPatrons in the new book section at Loussac Library\n\n2021 Goals\n\nIn 2021 we will focus on reintroducing services and programs, and respond to the educational and economic needs of the community during the pandemic recovery. We will also focus on meeting the technology needs of the unconnected in our community and continue our work to become more equitable and diverse.\n\n2021+ Goals\n- New Alaska Room at Loussac Library\n- Grow materials budget to \\$2M incrementally over next 4-5 years\n- Equity, diversity and inclusion work\n- Expand early literacy outreach to families most in need\n- Create Downtown and South Anchorage express libraries\n- Add staff positions to increase capacity:\n- Volunteer Coordinator\n- Branch staff to expand branch hours\n- Additional fundraising staff",
