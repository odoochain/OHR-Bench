        "text": "Indian Standard GUIDE FOR STORAGE OF PEARS\n\n\n0. FOREWORD\n0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution on 31 July 1975, after the draft finalized by the Fruits and Vegetables Sectional Committee had been approved by the Agricultural and Food Products Division Council.\n0.2 To ensure fuller utilization of perishable foodstuffs such as fruits and vegetables it is necessary that they should be preserved under conditions so as to maintain their fitness for human consumption over a period of time. Refrigeration is one of the important means to preserve these foodstuffs. For cold storage of various fruits and vegetables on scientific lines, a series of Indian Standard guides based on corresponding ISO Recommendations are being issued. It is hoped that these guides stipulating the conditions to be maintained for different fruits and vegetables would prove to be helpful in better administration of cold storages and in preventing avoidable wastage of fruits.\n0.3 In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been drawn from ISO/R 1134-1968 'Guide to cold storage of pears' issued by the International Organization for Standardization.\n0.4 This Institution had earlier issued IS : 7252-1974* which prescribes definitions and information concerning measurement of physical factors in cold stores.\n\n1. SCOPE\n1.1 This standard describes methods for obtaining conditions for the successful storage of pears.\n\n2. CONDITIONS OF HARVESTING AND PUTTING INTO STORAGE\n\n2.1 Harvesting\n2.1.1 The practical criteria of maturity most frequently used for defining the best time for harvesting may be as given below :\na) The basic colour of the outer skin;\n\nNote - The basic ground colour should be distinguished from the red anthocyanin pigmentation, the intensity and extent of which vary according to the variety and, to some extent, with the exposure to sunlight.\n\n\n*Guide for testing of physical conditions in cold stores.",

The grower may decide on his own criteria from those mentioned above for picking, on the basis of experience.\n2.1.3 Exact timing of the date of harvesting should be more important for early varieties than for late varieties.\n2.1.4 Fixing of time of harvesting should have greater importance for controlled-atmosphere storage than for storage in air.\n2.2 Quality Characteristics for Storage - Fruit put into cold storage should be sound, free from bruises or physiological disorders and free from any visible sign of fungal or bacterial attack. It should be clean and dry.\n2.3 Putting into Storage-The fruit should be put into the cold store as soon as possible after harvesting preferably after precooling. The temperature of the fruit should be lowered to a value suitable for the variety within four days. For achieving this, large quantities of cold air should be circulated in the cold storage room.\n2.4 Method of Storage - The fruit should be handled with care. The packages should allow free circulation of air. Storage densities of about 200 kg per cubic metre of usable space are recommended.\n2.4.1 When the fruits are stored in pellets, the storage density may be increased by 10 to 20 percent.\n\n3. OPTIMAL CONDITIONS OF STORAGE\n\n3.1 Temperature\n3.1.1 Pears should be kept at as low a temperature as possible, subject only to avoiding the risk of freezing. In general, the best results are obtained at -1 to $+0.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n3.1.2 A difference of $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in storage temperature has a profound effect on the time for which the pears can be kept. It has been shown that during cold storage the freezing point of the fruit falls slightly.\n\n\n*Equivalent to $1.0197 \\mathrm{kgf / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ or 1 bar or $14.5 \\mathrm{lbf} / \\mathrm{in}^{2}$.\n}",

When the temperature of the cold store is low $\\left(0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C},-1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ the pears change very little during their storage period in the cold store and it is necessary to submit them to a complementary ripening process at a higher temperature when they leave the cold store.\n3.1.4 Some varieties ripen completely at higher temperatures only if the preliminary period at low temperature has not been too long (for example Williams' Bon Chretien, Kashmiri Nakh and Chinese Sandy Pear ).\n3.1.5 An accidental rise in storage temperature can initiate ripening, hence while putting fresh fruits lots in cold store, loading arrangement should be such that it does not elevate the temperature more than $2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n3.1.6 Certain varieties do not withstand cold conditions well, and storing them at low temperature is some times responsible for the appearance of more or less widespread internal browning.\n3.1.7 The recommended temperatures for a few varieties are given in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1 RECOMMENDED TEMPERATURES\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  SL NO. & Vartety & Recommended TEMPERATURE & EXPECT STORAGE LIFE & General Remarks \\\\\n  (1) & (2) & (3) & (4) & (5) \\\\\n  & & ${ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ & & \\\\\n  \\multirow[t]{3}{*}{i)} & Williams' Bon Chretien & -1 to 0 & 9 to 11 weeks & a) Complimentary ripening necessary \\\\\n  & & & & b) Susceptible to scald \\\\\n  & & & & c) Ripens between $+10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $24^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ only \\\\\n  ii) & Beurre Hardy & 0 & 3 to 5 months & Complimentary ripening necessary \\\\\n  & Conference & -1 to 0 & 6 to 7 months & - \\\\\n  & Keiffer & -1 to 0 & $2 \\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 months & - \\\\\n  & Winter nelis & -1 to 0 & 6 to 7 months & - \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",
