Minimal difficulty.\n\n\nArchangel Michael textile, Museum Catharijneconvent, photo: Ruben de Heer, CCO, uploaded with Pattypan\n\nGLAM (i) WIKI\n\nUpload GLAM files the spreadsheet way!\n\nPattypan uploader is a new open source tool for easy, flexible uploads of files with extended descriptions.\n\n\nIt was developed with the uploads of files from small and medium GLAM institutions (and the volunteers who work with them) in mind. The uploader is a lightweight Java desktop application which allows you to choose the \\{\\{Artwork\\}\\}, \\{\\{Photograph\\}\\} or \\{\\{Information\\}\\} Commons templates - and then tweak them according to your needs, choosing only the fields that are needed, pre-filling the fields in which the information stays the same for one batch upload (e.g. the Institution or License field) and simplifying the process of uploading a batch of files from one source.\n\nSome of Pattypan's features:\n$\\checkmark$ Choose a Commons template: \\{\\{Artwork\\}\\}, \\{\\{Information\\}\\}, \\{\\{Photograph\\}\\}, then choose needed, specific description fields from that template\n$\\checkmark$ Upload faster (all repetitive information needs only to be copied across)\n$\\checkmark$ Input your own wikicode in any field\n$\\checkmark$ Preview the completed file description before uploading\nAdvantages for galleries, libraries, archives, and museums:\n$\\checkmark$ Easy to use\n$\\checkmark$ Detailed descriptions of files ensure they can be found and reused\n$\\checkmark$ Upload files from any folder on a PC\n$\\checkmark$ Create only descriptions and templates relevant to your institution\n\nVery quick instructions:\n- Prepare a folder containing the files to upload\n- Download Pattypan and run the pattypan.jar file\n- Click Generate spreadsheet and navigate to a folder containing the files you would like to upload\n- Select the fields to include in the file descriptions (e.g. date, dimensions, institution, source, etc.)\n- Open and edit the resulting spreadsheet, then save\n- Validate and upload: preview file descriptions and correct any errors\n- Login and upload!\n\nPattypan uploader is open-source, so it is possible to add features, improvements, or tweak the application for specific needs. The instruction manual, download link, and additional materials for users can be found on Wikimedia Commons under Commons: Pattypan.",
