Up to 99 positions can be indexed on one video cassette tape. The INDEX SELECT Buttons searches the desired recording start point and start playback immediately.\n\nBLANK DETECT Button\n\nThis button searches any blank (unrecorded part of the tape extending for 14 seconds in the fast forward mode, about 3 minutes in the SP mode, or about 9 minutes in the SLP mode) during recording or playback. The tape is then brought to the start of the blank portion.\n\nREMAINING TIME Button\n\nWhen this button is pushed during recording and normal playback, the numerals on the Tape Counter disappear and the remaining tape time is indicated.\n\nVideo Add Function\n\nThe unit eliminates the editing problem common to previous VCRs. When the Pause/Still Button is pushed during recording, the tape will automatically rewind a little. This reduces to a minimum any interference caused by pauses during recording.\n\nStereophonic sound\n\nTwo audio tracks permit recording from two microphones, preamplified stereo phonograph, etc. for playback in stereo sound, or for bilingual source material.\n\nCamera Input Terminal\n\nA camera with a power consumption of less than 8.8 W can directly be connected this terminal.\n\nDolby NR circuitry\n\nThis VCR can be operated with Dolby NR. Dolby NR is a noise reduction system which greatly suppresses background noise in the audio signal caused by the tape. Dolby NR circuitry enables you to retain a good sound quality.\n*'Dolby' and the double-D symbol are trademarks of Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation.",

There are other VHS units available which operate on 2-hour, 4-hour (LP) and 6-hour formats. The unit cannot record LP recording.\n- If the VCR is suddenly moved from a cold place to a warm place, moisture that can cause damage to both the tape and the unit may form inside the unit. Avoid such changes in temperature, if possible.\nWhen excessive moisture is present within the VCR, the Dew Indicator Lamp will light up and the VCR will not operate to prevent damage to the tape or the video recording mechanism.\n-Do not block or cover the ventilation slots on the top, back and bottom of the unit. Especially avoid soft materials such as cloth or paper.\n-Use the unit in a horizontal position and do not place anything heavy on it.\n- Take special care not to use or store the unit for a long period of time in direct sunlight, in excessively hot, cold, damp or dusty places, or places subject to heavy vibrations.\n-Do not insert fingers or any other objects into the cassette holder.\n\n-CLEANING CARE FOR THE RECORDING HEAD ...\n\nThe video heads of your Panasonic video recorder are extremely sensitive. Although hardly ever necessary, in the event video head cleaning must be performed, it is recommended that the cleaning be done by a qualified technician. The need for video head cleaning is indicated if playback of a known good tape results in a very snowy picture but with good sound.\n- Avoid operating or storing the unit and video cassettes near appliances generating strong magnetic fields (large motors, power transformers, or large audio speakers).\n- Keep the unit away from flower vases, tubs, sinks, etc. CAUTION: If liquids should be spilled into the unit, serious damage will be caused. If you spill any liquid into the unit consult qualified service personnel.\n-Do not spray any cleaner or wax directly on the unit or use forced air to remove dust.\n-Do not attempt to disassemble the unit. There are no user serviceable parts inside.\n-Refer to qualified service personnel for any technical problems.\n-Please read the attached limited warranty card completely.",

Don't insert and eject the video cassette over and over again, because this may result in tape looseness or scratches on the tape.\n- Never try to disassemble the cassette or splice the tape.\n-Don't open the cassette, touch the tape, or put anything inside the cassette.\n\n- Video Cassette Storage\n- Avoid places where humidity is high or there is dust\n- Avoid places where there is magnetism (magnets, motors, transformers, speakers, etc.).\n- Avoid dropping the cassette; don't subject it to intense shaking or vibration.\n-Don't place cassettes in direct sunlight; keep them away from sources of heat.\n\nInsert Video Cassette Correctly\nVideo Cassettes can only be used with the window side up, and the arrow pointing away from you.\nDo not attempt to insert a cassette which is upside down or backwards.\n\n-The cassette can be loaded only when the VCR is powered. Do not force the cassette into the cassette holder with the power off.\n-Whenever the cassette is loaded, the Stop Button Lamp lights up (with the power on). Before trying to insert the cassette into the cassette holder, check that the Stop Button Lamp is off to make sure the cassette holder is empty.\n\nAccidental Erasure Prevension\n- Accidental erasure of recorded material can be prevented by breaking off the tab on the rear of the cassette with a screwdriver or similar tool.\n- If, for any reason, you later want to record on a cassette which has been protected as described above, recordings can be made by covering the hole (where the tab was) with cellophane tape.\n\n\nAccidental Erasure Prevention Tab\n-To prevent accidental erasure\n\n-To record again",

Up to 99 positions can be indexed on one video cassette tape. These buttons search the desired recording start points and start playback automatically.\n\nAutomatic search with the INDEX SELECT Buttons is possible if the recording time is 2 or more minutes. Search operations can be performed more conveniently if numbers are jotted down along with the titles of the recordings on the video cassette in accordance with the recording sequence as an index. Then positions on the tape can be searched using the INDEX SELECT Buttons.",

The tape is then brought to the start of the blank portion.\n\n\nWhen the BLANK DETECT Button is pushed, the digits on the Tape Counter disappear if there is a blank on the tape and when the lamp corresponding to this button flashes on and off.

This means that the remote commands are sent out as invisible light.\n\nFor best operation, aim the Wireless Remote Control directly at the receiver window (Remote Sensor) on the VCR. You may find that commands are received even if the Wireless Remote Control is aimed away from the VCR.\nThis happens because the infra-red beam will bounce off the walls of the room and eventually reach the remote sensor. Note that furniture can block the path, and dark walls may totally absorb the light. If the room receives a lot of sunshine, you may find that the commands are \"masked\" by the bright light.
