        "text": "The desire to restore the Mary Clark Thompson Chapel at Woodlawn Cemetery has been several years in the making. In late 2014, the cemetery was placed on both the State and National Register of Historic Places, a monumental step in pushing forward with preservation efforts.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the Canandaigua Cemetery Association and a community committee have joined forces to begin a campaign to raise funds that are needed for a full restoration. This demonstrates our commitment in honoring the past by restoring it today and renewing its life for future generations.\n\nWhile it is important to preserve this architectural treasure which was originally given to the Canandaigua community by noted philanthropist Mary Clark Thompson, a refurbished chapel will be extremely relevant to today, with opportunities to use this beautiful building for nondenominational services, wedding celebrations, final interment ceremonies, arts and cultural events such as intimate concerts and speakers, and other gatherings.\n\nThe Woodlawn Chapel originally could seat approximately 75 people in its main sanctuary. Once restored, seating will be increased and include additional space in an adjacent room. There will also be a multipurpose room available for a gathering or meeting. Once completed, the stunning stained glass windows and magnificent pipe organ will certainly dazzle everyone who visits the chapel.\n\nWe are honored to lead this community campaign and to be entrusted as the stewards of Mary Clark Thompson's legacy. This great philanthropist gave so much to the community that she loved. We think it is only fitting to restore one of her gifts, the Chapel, to honor our ancestors who are interred at Woodlawn Cemetery and to create a new space for programs and celebrations for generations to come.\n\nThank you for your generosity and your commitment to our community.\n\n\nPatrick J.

        "text": "WOODLAWN CEMETERY CHAPEL HISTORY\n\nIn 1909, through the generosity of philanthropist Mary Clark Thompson, a beautiful chapel was erected under the supervision of Engineer John Handrahan and designed by eminent Boston architect, Francis R. Allen.\n\nThe chapel, with an artistic modern cut stone bridge, was constructed from native material including limestone with trimmings of Medina sandstone. The chapel was dedicated on Saturday, October 1st, 1910.\n\nA provision in the Last Will of Matilda Burgher provided for the Hook \\& Hastings pipe organ that was specifically made for the Woodlawn Cemetery Chapel.\n\nThe chapel remained fully functional for well over five decades until the doors were closed to public use and the heat was turned off. Over the years the building fell into disrepair. Layers of dirt and grime began to cover the once brilliant white marble stage and ceramic tile floor. The moisture seeped into the plaster walls toppling them to the floor. The once immaculate woodworking along the walls, pews and hand-carved podiums became stained, cracked, and weathered. The colorful stained glass windows, imported from England, ost their shine but not their character. In the early 1990's, a massive blow from a falling oak tree damaged a major portion of the, seemingly indestructible, slate roof. At that time, a new architectural-style shingle roof replaced the slate\n\nSlowly, the community took interest in the chapel once again. The chapel was a highlight of a 2007 walking tour and was on the \"Sonnenberg Holiday Home Tour\" in 2011. In 2013 and 2014, a \"Wine \\& Spirits Tour\" event was held to highlight the chapel and the notables interred at the cemetery. On September 11, 2014 Woodlawn Cemetery was listed on the NYS Register of Historic Places and on November 12, 2014 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nPROJECTED RESTORATION \\& PRESERVATION EXPENSES\n\nPreliminary estimates obtained from architects and builders have provided us with a list of interior and exterior repairs with approximate costs. The repairs have been categorized and are shown below.\nRoof Project ..... \\$ 225,000\nExterior Restoration ..... \\$ 250,000\nStonework\nParking facilities\nRailings/Grilles\nDoors/Hardware\nPainting\nSitework\nInterior Restoration ..........................\nWoodwork\nThermal \\& Moisture\nDrywall\nPainting\nElectrical\nPlumbing\nMechanicals \\& Safety $\\qquad$\nEnvironmental clean-up\nPermits/Bonds/Insurance\nSecurity systems\nHVAC\nStained Glass Windows Restoration ..\n\\$ 69,000\nPipe Organ Restoration\n\nContingency/Endowment Fund\n$\\qquad$ \\$ 300,000 (Funds set aside for cost overages and to establish a maintenance endowment to cover future repair needs.)\n\nTOTAL PROJECTED COSTS $\\qquad$ \\$ 1,300,000\n\nCOMMUNITY CHAPEL COMMUNTTY EFFORT\n\nThe Board of Directors recognizes the restoration and preservation of Woodlawn Cemetery and the chapel as a gift to the community and a work of art that enhances the natural beauty of Canandaigua. The project also breathes new life into the corporate body of the cemetery. Numerous services and activities will be launched inviting more people to the cemetery ultimately increasing the knowledge and utilization of the assets of the Canandaigua Cemetery Association. Ancillary services and activities will be packaged and promoted more visibly that will compliment organization structure and will not dilute or fragmentize current management and operations.\n\nAs a non-denominational community cemetery, this project is truly a community effort with community rewards. Restoring the chapel will offer new opportunities to the public while enhancing the cemetery and what the cemetery has to offer to the community.\n\nIn prospective... our community, our cemetery, ou chapel.\n\n\nVisually, the need to restore and preserve the chape may be obvious. However, the use and sustainability after restoration is very important for preservation so that the chapel is enjoyed for many generations to come.\n\nInitially the chapel was built for committal services, as a place where family and friends could pay tribute to their loved ones without having to suffer the weather at a graveside service. It is of great importance to be able to offer this service once again, avoiding liability and hazardous conditions at the time of grieving.\n\nWe are excited for the potential additional uses that the restored chapel facility will offer. Some of the suggested services and activities include: committal services worship services; vow renewals; lectures; guided tours meetings; cultural and social events; small musica venue; plays and recitals; small intimate weddings; and educational forums\n\nThe cemetery is currently utilized by the Finger Lakes Community College, and the Canandaigua Primary Elementary, and Middle schools as an outdoor class room.\n\nWoodlawn, and the chapel in particular, is a popular destination for independent artists and photographers, including a local organization that provides photography sessions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It is anticipated that the same pas sion for the cemetery and the exterior of the chapel wil be even more bountiful when these cultural activities are offered from within the chapel.\n\nIt is important that Woodlawn, a non-denominational community-oriented cemetery, offer services and opportunities in the chapel, an architectural treasure, for all the public to utilize and enjoy.\n\nThank you for your support.",
