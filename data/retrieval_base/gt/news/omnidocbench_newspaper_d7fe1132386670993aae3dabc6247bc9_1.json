NMFS developed a management program for Bering Sea and Aleutian Isllands Management Area [BSAl] pollock to include a set of AFA permanent permits for AFA calcher/ processors, AFA catcher vessels, AFA inshore processors, and AFA motherships. All vessels and processors partieipating in the non-Community Development Quota (CDQ] BSAl pollock fishery are required to have valid AFA permits on board the vessel or on site at the processing plant.\n\nWith the exceptions of the inshore vessel cooperatives, replacement vessel, and inshore vessell contract fishing applications, the AFA permit program had a one-time application deadline of December 1, 2000. All permitted partieipants in the AFA pollock fishery are already established and are issued with an indefinite expiration date.\n\nIn a previous revision to this collection, a PSC limit of Chinook salmon was established for the pollock industry participants in an industrydeveloped contractual arrangement, called an incentive plan agreement [IPA] that establishes an incentive program to minimize bycatch at all levels of Chinook salmon abundance. NMFS issues transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to eligible entities representing the catcher/ processor sector, the mothership sector, inshore cooperatives, and CDQ groups. Transferable allocations provide the polllock feet the flexibility to maximize the harvest of pollock while maintaining Chinook salmon bycatch at or below the PSC limit.\n\nRevision: The notary signature requirements have been removed from the Application for Replacement Vessel and the Application for Inshore Catcher Vessel Cooperative Permit.\n\nAffecfed Puhlic: Rusiness or other forprofit organizations.\n\nFrequency: Annually and on occasion.\n\nRespondent's Obligation: Required to obtain or retain benefits.\n\nOMB Desk Officer.
