Gardner, AKC\n\n\nMany times in the past I have requested voluntary contributions from our readers for publication in the Skywriter. Many times in the past I have been disappointed by the lack of enthusiasm with which this request was met. Now, at long last, I have a contribution not from a fellow serviceman, but, from . . . well, read on you'll see!\n\nI could launch into a lengthy dissertation on the People to People program and tell you what an important role it plays in Japanese/American relations. I could also tell you all about how it fits into our Leadership Program. But, I'm going to save my breath. It would seem that I have already wasted my efforts in past issues of the Skywriter. I have been directing words to the wrong people!\n\nRead now this letter submitted to me by a Japanese employee for publication. The writer wishes to remain anonymous to avoid possible embarassment, although I can see no reason why he would be embarassed.\n\nNEW BEAUTY DISCOVERY\n\nThe O-Bon Dancing held on August 10 impressed me a great deal. It was the greatest people to people program I had ever seen. Although I have worked at other naval bases for a few years. I have never seen such a heart-warming mingling of American and Japanese people. It surely was a grand night for all of them. I believe.\n\nI noticed many American men wearing Yukata or Japanese summer kimono. But, I say very few American women wearing Yukata. A young Okusan (wife) in Yukata accompanying her husband and children who were also in Yukata, attracted my eyes. She wore a showy, but decent Yukata, Obi (Japanese traditional broad belt), and Japanese felt soled sandals-from every point of view she was exactly dressed as a Japanese women. Not only well fitted to Kimono style, but beautiful she was! With her up-swept hair style, upside down cone shaped posture, she looked just as though she came out of a Japanese costume book. She seemed to captivate even Japanese women's eyes. I noticed young Japanese boys and girls were sending her unsolicited applauses.\n\nA spindle shaped body formation is considered to be most fitted to Kimono. I suppose western women have been believed unsuitable to wearing Kimono because their shoulders are broader than the small, sloping shoulders of Japanese women. However, American women tend to have slimmer lower extremeties than do Japanese women, tapering sharply from well formed hips to feet while Japanese women tend to have O-shaped legs. In addition, American women's heads are smaller than those of Japanese. In other words, their heads are equal to $1 / 8$ the total length of their bodies and that is considered an ideal body formation from the aesthetic standpoint.\n\nThese characteristics of body structure well offset the shortcomings of broader shoulders in wearing Kimono. In this regard, the young Okusan with the up-swept hair-do was smarter in appearance than Yvette Giraud, a French chansoniere who once showed up on a TX show in Kimono with a bulky hanging hair-do.\n\nThe Japanese summer is hot and humid. Mu-mu or traditional Western style one piece clothes may be cooler and more convenient than Yukata. But, Yukata style is much more beautiful than the comfort -first mu-mu or one piece clothes.\n\nI think there were many others who dug out, that night, the long buried treasure of beauty in the American woman's Yukata style. Some must have dreamed of seeing ladies wearing Yukata at their clubs, Why don't you American ladies wear Yukato more-not only on special occasions but, daily, in the evenings at clubs, at restaruants, in the parks or on the street!!\n\nSigned,\nA Japanese Employee.\nQuestions You May Be Asked\n\nWhen You're Overseas\n\nReprinted with permission from Americans Abroad, copyright 1961 by American Council for Nationalities Service.\nQUESTION-How can your allies be expected to resist aggression if their defense by the United States would mean widespread destruction in a nuclear war?\nU.S. defense of its allies would not necessarily involve them in a total nuclear war. In the first place, the principal goal of our political and defense policies is to maintain enough deterrent strength to prevent such a war, and to enable us to negotiate effectively for world disarmament.\n\nIf the deterrent failed-and we are determined it will not-the United States and the Soviet Union, as the nations with the greatest nuclear attack power, would be the primary victims in an all-out war.\n\nWe believe local aggression against an ally can be resisted by our combined military forces whose conventional weapons. A strong and highly mobile force of this type should be a deterrent to attack, and an adequate defense should an attack come.",

Ciancitto made a successful low-level ejection from his \"Skyhawk\" jet about a quarter of a mile from the end of the runway after experiencing control difficulyy.\nThe plane landed in an open field after shearing power lines of a nearby electric railway and burst into flames. Atsugi's crash crew quickly put out the fire.\nA rescue helicopter, piloted by LTJG William H. Englund, picked up Ciancitto as he stood in an open field near the crash and took him to the Atsugi dispensary. He was later transferred to Camp Zama Army Hospital where he is being treated for a broken shoulder.\nCiancitto is assigned to Attack Squadron 23 based aboard the USS Midway. The squadron is temporarily deployed to Atsugi while the carrier is in port in Yokosuka.\nawards, the detachment mustered for basic annual swimming requalifications. Included were a 20 foot underwater swim, a demonstration of the \"tired swimmer's carry\" and a 200.yard endurance swim in which the four basic strokes were used: breast, back, side, and crawl.\n\nAsked the reason for this seemingly unusual formation, Leading Chief John W. Scott said:\n\"Two reasons-first, current instructions call for annual swim checks on these people and second, the skipper felt that the crew looked so good at the last two inspections that it would be a good way to reward 'em. I think it's a great idea.\"\n\nHonorary member of the inspection party was D. E. Tomkins, AMHC, who is scheduled for departure to NAS Beeville, Texas in September. Chief Tomkins officiated at presentation of awards to J. G. Yurko, AMSCA; R. C. Cummings, ADR1; J. B. Hill, ADR2; R. P. Bubeck, AMS2; A. H. Price, AE3 and E. R.

Some of the arts of War (Bushi-do) have become popular throughout the western world. Thus, the Budo-Ka student studying Karate in Chicago has, in a sense, exported the way of the Samurai to the USA.\n\nArchery\n\nIn the earliest times, Japanese were renowned archers with bows measuring some $7 \\frac{1}{2}$ feet. Bows were so large people were said to have rested and shot them on the ground from a kneeling position. Archery was at a stand still in the Ashikaga period (1336-1573), but experienced a comeback in the Tokugawa period, even though firearms were in use.\n\nToday, archery has become one of Japan's leading sports with annual contests held for men and women.\n\nKendo (Japanese Swordsmanship)\n\nKendo was first used as protection from attack during the Kamakura and Tokugawa periods. It is now practiced as a sport with bamboo swords instead of steel.\n\nOnly the most experienced men today are capable of giving exhibitions with real swords. The steel ones used for exhibitions are able to cut a piece of fine silk in MID-AIR.\n\nJudo or Jujitsu\n\nJujitsu is said to have been introduced to Japan by the Chinese in the 17th century. Dr. Jigoro Kano, a government official during the late 1800 's, is credited for having developed judo in Japan from the original art of jujitsu. Dr. Kano founded a judo institution in Tokyo around 1882.\nSays Lindy Avakian in his book \"The Secrets of Judo;\"\n\"Judo is a derivative of jujitsu and is the correct term used to refer to that art in today's language. The word judo specifically explains the truer meaning of the art as it is practiced today. The ju part of the work means 'gentleness' or 'giving way' and implies a flexibility of techniques, while the do part means 'way' and signifies the application of the ju principle in the execution of the techniques, not only in physical exertions of the judoist but also in his mental attitude. The older jitsu, which was replaced by do, meant 'technique' or 'art.'\"\nIn the eighteen hundreds most of the Japanese women knew judo for self-protection.\n\nJudo is as popular today as it was a century ago and has an increasingly number of followers.",

These surgeons and stewards were not specifically trained to render dental care and their attempts to extract aching teeth and to lance painful abscesses in no way compares with the complete dental service provided in 1962. Today more than 1700 Nayal Dental Officers bring modern dental treatment to our servicemen afloat and ashore throught the world.

Connolly Effective Solutions\n\nA professor of mine some years ago commented on the international tensions-how difficult and almost hopeless effective solutions were until people were willing to admit that they were a part of the problem.\n\nIt is only human to place blame for conditions, whatever they are, outside ourselves. This applies to problems within our Christian faith as it does to problems within and outside our nation. As long as we seek to identify other forces only with the problem, and ourselves only with the solution, there is limited chance of improved conditions.\n\nIf there are problems and lack of spiritual vitality within our chapels and nation, to what extent are they due to external influences? Are we likely to solve the problems until we Christians recognize that we, before God, are personally a part of these problems? If there is a lack of spiritual power, if an atmosphere of expectancy does not pervade our worship, can this be attributed to something beyond ourselves? The beginning of the solution may well be our own personal acceptance of and dedication to the fact that \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\"\n\nWhat are some personal requirements for genuine spiritual expectancy to pervade our worship?\n\nA drawing near to God. A fresh view of the meaning of our Christian experience and the reality of the Christian faith we share is basic to spiritual prosperity. It is the renewing of our faith that gives us inner assurance and resources adequate to overcome any external difficulty.\n\nAn understanding of the divine task. The work of a Christian and of a chapel is not something of our own making. It is not individually conceived or contrived; it is not an elective course, but a divine assignment to accept. Jesus took the assignment from the Father, completed his part, and that same assignment Jesus has entrusted to Christians everywhere-\"Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.\" Such an understanding of our divine task will call us to a united purpose that overrides all obstacles.\n\nA willingness to perform our Christian task. In the work of Christ, no scheme or plan can ever substitute for the individual Christian's personal service. No one else can engage in worship and fellowship with God for me. No one can serve in my stead. Could it be that the lack of personal involvement on the part of so many Christians is a basic problem for us?\n\nAs we enter into our tour of duty with you as Chaplain and people, we have every assurance that if we draw near to God, recognize the divine and personal nature of the Christian task, and give ourselves devotedly to the performance of the Christian ministry. God will supply whatever is lacking. This is indeed a difficult solution, but God is never far away when we seek his assistance.\n\nDivine Service Schedule\n\nProtestant Roman Catholic\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{ NAS Ch } \\\\\nSunday \\\\\n0845 & Sunday School-all ages & \\\\\n0900 & Divine Worship \\\\\n1000 & Divine Worship and Nursery & Wre-school age children \\\\\n& 0 \\\\\n1800 & Junior and Senior Fellowship \\\\\n1900 & Divine Worship (Vesper Services) \\\\\nWednesday 1630 Japanese Bible Study and 1900 Worship \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nEast Camp Chapel\n\\begin{tabular}{ll} \nSunday & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{ Sunday } \\\\\n0830 Worship Service & 0730 Mass \\\\\n0930 Men's Bible Class & 0930 Mass\n\\end{tabular}\n\n0830 Worship Service \n\n0730 Mass\n\n0930 Men's Bible Class\n\n1130 Christian Science Service\nWednesday\n\n1900 Religious Movie\n\n2000 Christian Discussion Group\n\nSunday\n0730 Mass\n\n1130 Mass\n\nWeekday\n\n0630 Daily Mass\n\n1900-2000 Saturday Confessions",
