The forms require information which is readily available from handler records and which can be provided without data processing equipment or trained statistieal staff.

The final rule provides thal, in the second case, the OCC will apply. among other factors, the same factors as it applies to the establishment of a de novo bank. This new approval requirement will enable the OCC to better assess the bank's compliance with applicable law and whether the proposed change comporls with safe and sound banking practices.\n\nDATES: Effective Date: October 1, 2004\n\n FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: FOr questions concerming the final rule, contact Heidi M.

DC 20219.\n\n# SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\n# I. Introduction\n\nThe OCC's current regulations at 12 CFR part 5 do not require the approval of the OCC before a national bank substantially changes the composition of its assets through sale or other disposition, nor do they require prior OCC review or approval before a national bank charter becomes a \"'stripped\" or \"dormant\" bank charter. Likewise, our regulations do not address a dormant national bank's increase in asset size through purchases or acquisitions to engage again in the business of banking. On January 7, 2004, we proposed to add to our regulations a prior approval requirement for these fundamental changes in a bank's asset composition in order to address the supervisory concerns raised by these types of transactions. See 69 FR 892 [an. 7,2004].\n\nAs deseribed in the preamble to the proposed rule, these concerns may include increased operations risk, increased concentration risk (especially where asset composition changes as a result of divestiture), and the ability of bank management to implement the new strategy successfully. In addition, a dormant bank being revived may propose to engage in activities that significantly deviate or are a change from the bank's original business plan or operations. If ill conceived, poorly planned,or inadequatelv executed these new activities can expose the bank to imprudent levels of risk, with the potential for adverse consequences for the bank's financial condition and, in the extreme situation, for its viability. Even entry into lines of business thal are traditional for national banks may present elevated levels of risk to a partieular bank if the bank expands substantially or too quickly from a dormant status, misjudges its markets, or fails to ensure that bank management and internal control systems keep pace with the change. The preamble to the proposal also noted that concerns raised by the acquisition of a dormant bank by a third party necessitates the need for the OCC to thoroughly review the nature of the services and products that might be initiated by an acquiring entity.\n\nFor the reasons discussed in this preamble, we are adopting in final form",
