To Arms! Defend Your Homes and Firesides!\"\n\nWith the temperature near 90, it was a poor day for defending firesides. Maybe that's why George Garrett deserted the Confederate Army at Six Flags Over Texas.\n\n\"I've been running since Bull Run or some place,\" admitted Garrett, a 20-year-old history major at Arlington State College, as they tied him to a post and put a blindfold on him.\n\nTerry's Rangers of the Eighth Texas Cavalry, C.S.A., was rehearsing a big scene at Six Flags Sunday. The Rangers formerly caught a Yankee spy and executed him.\n\nSome visiting Yankees winced at seeing one of their own get it, however. So, the outfit is getting a new script. It calls for the liquidation of a Rebel deserter.\n\nGarrett won the big role. Col. Mark Lamkin, 22, called his troopers together. They were dressed in something close to Confederate uniforms — but they've switched their former gray wool for tropical worsted.\n\nOne of the Confederates is a Negro, Mickey Carson, 18, a pre-law student at ASC. Everybody does a double-take when he marches by.\n\n\"I'm a true-blooded Negro but I say if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,\" he grinned.\n\nMickey and the others are members of ASC's ROTC marching unit, the Jody Drill Team. History majors in the outfit insist that there were actually some Negro soldiers in the Confederate Army.\n\nColonel Lamkin has risen fast in the Six Flags ranks. \"I started out three years ago as just a rifleman,\" he said as grandly as any self-made man. Now, at times, he assumes a beard and the role of a Confederate general.\n\nAs a general, he makes a recruiting talk to the crowd. He tells them, \"Protect your wives, women, girls, children, horses, cattle, hogs, dogs, sheep, pigs, calves, homes, firesides and stills.\"\n\nEven if it sounds like an insurance commercial, it works. Little kids flock up to enlist. The general signs the boys into the Confederate Army and the girls into the Nurse Corps. Then he shows them how to do right face and left face.\n\nGarrett was still a little vague about which battle he deserted as the firing squad assembled. The script hasn't been completed. As a soldier ripped open his tunic, the firing squad shouldered their Sharps rifles.\n\n\"Ready! ... Aim! ...\" shouted the colonel. The crowd was pressing up. Everybody was still.\n\nYou could hear a firing pin drop.\n\nBalooey!\n\nSmoke blew, rifleman flinched, little kids put their fingers in their ears and Terry's Rangers marched off with a hole in their ranks.",
