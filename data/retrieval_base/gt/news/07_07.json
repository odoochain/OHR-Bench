She found The Ripped Bodice - a bookstore in Culver City that was doing so well, it was expanding to a second location in Brooklyn. \"That was intimidating,\" she said. If their success was daunting, it also suggested that there might be room for another romance store. So this February, she opened Smitten on a busy strip of Main Street, about 60 miles from her competitor. In the months since, Smitten has become a vibrant hub for romance readers, with author signings, tarot readings, book clubs and trivia and craft nights. Customers sometimes approach her with highly specific requests. \"Someone came in and was like, 'I like fantasy, I want it to be queer, I want it to have representation from a different culture and I want it to be as smutty as possible,'\" Tingstrom said. And they come in often. \"I have regulars who come a couple of times a week,\" Tingstrom said.} \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n  \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nOver the last two years, the U.S. went from having two dedicated romance bookstores\nto a network of more than 20 . \"I'm like, didn't you just buy tw books the other day?\"\nOnce a niche that independent Once a niche that independent\nbooksellers largely ignored, ro mance is now the hottest thing in he book world.
