(A decision is expected in June 1995.) Sweet Home will determine whether the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has the legal authority to prohibit landowners from using their property in otherwise legitimate ways, simply because those uses inadvertently modify endangered species habitat. The case, originally filed in 1991 by nine Pacific Northwest citizens, several timber-dependent businesses and communities, and two southern timber associations, charged that the Service overstepped its congressional authority when it issued the criteria. In a 2-1 ruling on March 11, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., agreed.\n\nESA background\n\nCongress adopted the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973, \"to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend may be conserved . ..\" The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service are charged with the task of formulating and implementing a management plan that provides for the \"conservation and survival of the species.\" It is important to note that only federal agencies bear this responsibility. Private property owners may choose to participate in this conservation effort, but the law does not obligate them to do so.\nAll citizens, however, are precluded\nfrom \"taking\" an endangered species. The term \"take\" means \"to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect\" an endangered species. Civil penalties range from a maximum of $\\$ 500$ for an \"unknowing take,\" to a fine of $\\$ 200,000$ and one year in prison for the \"knowing take\" of an endangered species.\n\nDefining a \"take\"\n\nThe ten verbs defining \"take\" in the ESA describe physical actions specifically directed against endangered wildlife. \"Take\" verbs do not describe inadvertent or unintentional activity. Nevertheless, FWS has promulgated regulations defining \"harm\" as, \"an act which ... may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.\"\nRecords of the 1973 ESA Congressional debates, however, clearly reveal that Congress provided remedies other than criminal prosecution for such situations. According to Representative Sullivan, Chairwoman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, Congress intended the Department of Interior to use land acquisition as the only legitimate way to deal with the issue of inadvertent \"harm\" caused by habitat modification. It deliberately deleted all references to habitat modification from the list of ten verbs describing a \"take.\" Following a heated debate, the verb \"harm\" was also dropped from the list, but added again on\n\n\nContinued on page 2\n\n\n\nNH beats another Wild \\& Scenic River designation!\n\n\n\nby David Tardif\n\n\nWhen the Concord (NH) City Council voted 11-3 against federal designation of the Upper Merrimack River under the federal Wild \\& Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) on April 12, it completed a clean sweep. The City of Franklin and the Towns of Boscawen, Canterbury and Northfield had already voted decisively against federal designation a year before.\nIt also marked the second straight defeat for the National Park Service (NPS), federal designation having been rejected a year earlier by six out of seven towns on the Pemigewasset River, under the leadership of the New Hampshire Landowners Alliance (NHLA)\nIn the beginning it was an upbill battle, because the environmental establishment, including the Society for Protection of New Hampshire Forests\n\nContinued on page 11",

This policy continues today, despite a July 2 , 1981 determination by the Service's own legal department that the term \"harm\" includes only those actions directed against, and likely to injure or kill, individual wildlife species.\nFish and Wildlife Service claims an expansive interpretation of \"harm\" is crucial to preservation efforts because, of the 1,200 species entrusted to its care, more than $90 \\%$ are found on nonfederal lands.\nTo this, Sweet Home attorneys respond: \"We do not doubt that it is an administratively conve-\nSir William Blackstone nient tool, but it is not the tool that Congress, balancing all the relevant and competing factors, ultimately chose.\" Part of the problem lies with the methodology used to determine an endangered species. Increasingly, FWS has focused on wildlife groups below the species level, resulting in the presence of protected populations virtually everywhere.\nFurthermore, in its amicus curiae brief supporting the Sweet Home position, Mountain States Legal Foundation contends, \"There can be found no support for the notion that Congress can delegate to the FWS the legislative power to define what acts 'harm' endangered species for the purpose of potential criminal liability.\" Mountain States cites Article 1, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, which precludes Congress from delegating its legislative power to another branch of government.\nAccording to the legal foundation, when Congress empowered the Fish and Wildlife Service with ESA rule making authority, it violated the Constitution. \"A delegation doctrine that allows Congress to abdicate its power to define the elements of a criminal offense, in favor\nof an unelected administrative agency, such as the FWS,\" argues Mountain States, \"does violence to the time-honored separation of powers principle.\" The Supreme Court is urged,\"to confirm the constitutional rule that only Congress, and not an administrative agency, may define the essential elements of a criminal offense.\"\n\nA vicious will\n\nThe distinguished British jurist, Sir William Blackstone, observed in the eighteenth century: \"An unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at",

        "text": "V could drain homeowner resources\n\n\n\nBy Bob Rogers SSBJ staff\n\n\nTTough new state septic system regulations effectively prevent as many as 40 percent of the regions's homeowners without municipal sewerage from selling their homes and make even minor changes or additions to those homes practically unaffordable.\nThe new requirements, an amended version of the state's \"Title V\" septic codes, became law throughout Massachusetts March 31. The law requires all property owners involved in a real estate transaction to pay for a septic system inspection either nine months before or six months after the sale of their property.\nTitle $V$ also requires homeowners planning any home improvement program which will change the \"footprint\" of their property-the outline of the house, as shown on blueprints filed with the community's building department-to pay for an inspection. Decks, sunrooms and garages are all considered changes to home's blueprint.\n\n\nAll but impossible\nThe inspection itself must be performed by a certified inspector, generally either a professional engineer, regional sanitarian or local health officer. During the inspection, the inspector must find and open both ends of a property's septic system, no matter where they are. The official must then judge the system according to a rigid list of criteria supplied by Title $\\mathrm{V}-\\mathrm{a}$ list that makes it all but impossible for many homes to pass inspection.\nAll septic systems must be located above the high groundwater elevation in a given area. The systems must be located at least 10 feet from a property line, 50 feet from any vegetated wetland, salt marsh or private well, and 100 feet from any surface water supply. Any septic tank made of metal or any system that requires pumping four times a year or more is an automatic failure, as are the majority of cesspools.\n\"It's possible that a cesspool could pass inspection,\" said engineer Neil Murphy of Murphy Associates. \"But 90 percent of them are going to fail.\"\nBased on his experience as an inspec-\n\ntor on the South Shore, Murphy predicts the new regulations will have dire consequences for South Shore homeowners.\n\"I have recently performed 11 Title V inspections in Scituate and Cohasset,\"\nthe possibility that a house can be sold.\n\"If someone is already going to be paying $\\$ 1000$ a month in mortgage payments, and then they find out they'll have to pay an additional $\\$ 1000$ to have\n> \"Under the new regulations, I anticipate 65 to 75 percent of the homes in Scituate [MA] will fail a septic system inspection. The people who are going to be hurt by this legislation aren't the builders of new homes - they're the owners of existing homes.\" - Neil Murphy, Murphy Associates\n\nMurphy said. \"Nine of those inspections identified failed systems.\"\n\"Under the new regulations, I anticipate 65 to 75 percent of the homes in Scituate will fail a septic system inspection. The people who are going to be hurt by this legislation aren't the builders of new homes-they're the owners of existing homes. The combination of small house lots, poor soil quality and a high water table means septic systems will have a very difficult time passing inspection.\"\nThe cost of failing a Title V inspection can be astronomical. An inspection itself can cost between $\\$ 600$ and $\\$ 1,200$. If the system fails, and groundwater percolation tests - an additional expense-show that a new septic system can safely be built on the site, the owner must pay for the design, permitting and construction of the new system, which Murphy estimates could cost between $\\$ 15,000$ and $\\$ 25,000$. If a homeowner's lot is too close to surface water or underground aquifers, or if percolation tests show the lot lacks enough permeable soil to accommodate a septic system, the owner must pay for the installation of a tight tank.\nAt an average installation cost of $\\$ 600$ to $\\$ 700$, a tight tank will hold the septage of a typical family for about two weeks, after which the tank must be pumped. Pumping could cost, at the bare minimum, about $\\$ 400$ a month for a family of two. Tight tanks are not only expensive and inconvenient; they also substantially decrease\ntheir septic system pumped, they're going to say forget it.\" Murphy said. \"Why would anyone want to pay $\\$ 2,000$ a month for a property that's only worth half of that?\"\n\nWorst of all\n\nWorst of all, Murphy estimates that local wastewater treatment plants will be able to accommodate the contents of few pumped tight tanks per month, possibly forcing homeowners to pay the exorbitant costs of trucking their pumped septage to an out-of-town treatment plant.\n\"In Norwell, where there is no treatment plant, residents have to have their septage hauled to West Bridgewater or Blackstone at a cost of $\\$ 350$ a trip.\" Murphy said.\n\nParticularly at risk for system failure are residents who live in coastal flood zones. Homeowners encouraged by recent federal legislation to elevate their homes as a protection against coastal storms are about to face a rude awakening. The new Title V regulations require all property owners who elevate their homes to elevate their septic systems as well-meaning that one room of the house must be set aside as a tight tank chamber, kept heated, and pumped regularly.\n\nOther Title V requirements include a stipulation making sink garbage disposal systems a very expensive proposition.\n\"Unless you have an engineering plan for your septic system that includes the\n\nContinued on page 4\nMay 1995",

Accommodating your system to include a disposal can often mean increasing it by 150 to 200 percent.\"\nSullivan who is president of the Massachusetts Health Officers' Association, blasted the state's Department of Environmental Protection for introducing sweeping changes in legislation at a time she believes most towns and homeowners are not economically prepared to deal with them.\n\nNot justified\n\"The state is trying to implement a good environmental code,\" Sullivan said. \"But their solutions do not justify the economic problems people are going to face. The state should have taken more time to study the situation before implementing these changes. I wish every one of these environmentalists had a tight tank.\"\nMurphy agreed.\n\"No one paid attention to just how bad these regulations were gong to be before they were put into effect,\" Murphy said. \"If you're paying $\\$ 400$ a month to have your septic system pumped out, that's money you could have been using to buy $\\$ 40,000$ worth of equity for your house. Instead, your property is being devalued.\"\n\nFew homeowners obtained some degree of exemption from the new Title $V$ regulations. They had submitted and received approval for their building plans or house sales before the March 31 deadline and now will have three years to complete their sale or housing project under the old Title V regulations.\n\nSimilarly, anyone whose property was included in an approved subdivision plan, disposal work permit or approval not-required form may complete operations under the old regulations. Transactions between family members do not require an inspection for approval.\n\"The best thing to do, if you want to sell your house, is to find the buyer you want and then have him or her adopt you,\" Sullivan joked.\nAlthough much has been made of the state's new \"betterment bill\" - legislation allowing homeowners to revamp their septic systems using town funds, to be repaid as betterment assessments - Sullivan re-\nmains skeptical of the bill's ability to function practically at the local level.\n\"Town meeting has to approve the money up front, without knowing how many people will be asking for betterments that year.\" Sullivan said. The funds are not included in the Proposition $21 / 2$ tax cap. But each town would have to set up a new bureaucracy to administer the funds. Currently, the health board is expected to do all the work. The town of Orleans already is experimenting with a betterment system under special legislation. (Voters) have approved about $\\$ 25,000$ for betterments this year, and have a waiting list of six people for that money. Not one system has been fixed yet.\"\nThe state also has approved $\\$ 10 \\mathrm{mil}-$ lion in aid to communities across the state struggling with the requirements of Title V. But communities with a relatively high median income are unlikely to receive any of the state money, Sullivan said.\nThe state needs a wake-up call for legislators to realize the impact the law will have on homeowners, towns and the real estate industry, said Sullivan as she encouraged individuals to petition the state to postpone implementation of the new Title $V$ regulations.\n\"If enough homeowners and realtors scream, maybe someone will do something before people who would rather sell their houses start burning them down,\" Sullivan said. \"The DEP, in passing this law, has shown they don't care about economics.\"\n\nKind of scary\n\"It's kind of scary,\" agreed real estate broker Julie Chapman of Scituate, a representative of the Hallmark 100. \"Obviously, the predictions are that a lot of systems will probably fail once the new regulations go into effect. We're not looking forward to watching that happen. Hopefully, all of the kinks and problems can be worked out of the system before too long.\"\n\nSullivan, too, hopes state and local authorities can eventually work together to make the revised Title V codes into a law everyone can live with.\n\"We're all on a learning curve with these new regulations right now, and that includes DEP,\" Sullivan said. \"The state is planning on establishing a peer advisory council, made up of bankers, lawyers and real estate agents, to work with the code. We expect to have a break-in period of about two years before any of us are really comfortable with it-if we can ever really be comfortable with it.\"\n\n> Title 5 begins to take its toll...\n\n> According to the Boston Sunday Globe (5/7/95), \"Sales of homes with private sewage systems did not cease on March 31, but backups are widespread.\"\n\n> The article began with the following account of the effects of the regulation.\n\nTwo weeks ago, retired teacher David Grant listed his house in Haverhill for sale. The 73 year-old widower dreamed of spending the rest of his days peacefully in Flathead Valley, Montana.\n\nLast week, Realtor John Lavin, yanked the \"For Sale\" sign out of the ground after Grant said he could no longer afford to sell the house he has lived in for nearly a half century and move. Grant had discovered his sewage disposal system failed to meet the state's new environmental code, Title 5, and that replacing the system would cost about $\\$ 40,000$.\n\"I'm outraged. I'm very disappointed, disgusted,\" Grant said in an interview. \"It's the end of a dream. One of the things I wanted to get away from was all these rules and regulations, and changing of the rules to make life more difficult. And I'll be damned, the thing that yanked the rug from under me was the thing that I was trying to get away from.\"\n\nOne month into the statewide program, homeowners are angry and confused about the implementation of Title 5 , which comes during the spring home sales season, traditionally the strongest selling period of the year.",

The presence of this code within the nation's legal skeleton was a direct result of grievances Americans suffered at the hands of the British. For example, trial by jury had long been the right of Englishmen. In 1696, however, Parliament passed the Acts of Trade and Navigation which declared that admiralty courts would try all cases involving commerce. Cases which came before admiralty courts were heard by crown-appointed judges, without benefit of a jury. Since American colonies were primarily commercial ventures, colonial issues fell under the jurisdiction of these courts.\nTrial without benefit of a jury, however, was not the only \"noose around the neck\" of American dissidents. In 1772, the Brit-\nish ship, Gaspee ran aground in Narragansett Bay below Providence, Rhode Island while pursuing colonial smugglers. Patriots burned the Gaspee to its water line and were sent to England for trial. To combat the smuggling problem, Parliament instituted the despised \"writs of assistance,\" which allowed British customs officials to enter colonial homes, without warrants, and search for contraband. For these reasons, and others, the Founding Fathers codified criminal procedures within the Bill of Rights.\n\nCriminal code\n\nAs the United States evolved from a nation of isolated, close-knit communities to one peopled by strangers, the Bill of Rights' mini-criminal code became increasingly more important. America's social structure changed but so did its\ncriminal law - from a vehicle for social control to one that protected private property. For example, most punishable crimes in Massachusetts during the 1600's were for drunkenness and formication. By $1800,40 \\%$ of all prosecutions in Massachusetts were for theft. Criminals were no longer defined as \"sinners\" against their immediate communities, but as people who threatened the property rights of the whole society.\n\nLocal rule\n\nDuring colonial development (before England tightened its political and legal control), the same people that were given authority to make local rules were also given the task of enforcing them. There was little concern, in these tight communities, whether judicial functions ought to be separated from those legislative or executive. It soon became apparent that enormous political power was enjoyed when those who sat in judgement and exacted punishment, also possessed the authority to define what constituted a criminal act. This situation was further exacerbated by the fact that new crimes were constantly being added to statute books, while few were ever repealed. In 1822, for example, Rhode Island possessed only fifty statutory crimes. By 1872 , that number had risen to 128 . \"In every state,\" observed Lawrence Friedman in A History of American Law,\" every extension of government power, every new form of regulation brought in a new batch of criminal law. In 1900, there was vastly more criminal law on the books than in 1850 or 1800 , hence... more crime.\"\n\nEnvironmental \"criminals\"\n\nFriedman's observations are especially pertinent in light of the explosive regulatory growth that developed during the 1970's. To the list of standard crimes defined by civilized society - murder, robbery, assault, violence and social disruption - the government added a new class, that of environmental degradation. New offenses, like water pollution and wildlife habitat destruction, carried the same punishments as longstanding capital crimes, like murder and theft. Environmental \"criminals\" were forced to forfeit their private property (money, possessions, land) and their freedom. John Posgai of Pennsylvania was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $\\$ 200,000$ for filling a wetland; Ocie Mills and his son Carey spent twenty-one months in federal prison for clearing a buildable lot, and wildlife habitat specialist Bill Ellen was incarcerated for six months during\n\nContinued on page 7",

        "text": "Washington State Legislature passes sweeping property rights bill\n\n\n\nBy Barbara Mossman\n\n\nDubbed as \"the strongest property rights bill in the nation,\" the Washington State legislature voted to make Initiative 164 law, instead of sending it to the voters in November.\nLike many states, Washington's legislature was Democratically controlled, liberal minded and definitely influenced by the environmental community. And like many states, the \"top down\" arrogant governing, and the autocratic interpretation of law by regulatory agencies, resulted in land use regulations that were\nqualifying it for the 1995 November ballot. But this time, a new strategy was used.\n\nKnowing, that the legislature could not change one syllable of a citizens' initiative, and knowing that the governor could not veto it, I-164 was placed, in bill form, on the docket for the 1995 legislative session.\nPublic hearings were held and citizens from all over the State of Washington crammed into small hearing rooms, overflowed into corridors, and packed hallways. People told heart wrenching sto-\n\nAmong other things, I-164 forces all regulatory agencies to do a complete economic analysis of any proposed regulation that affects land use.\ncrippling the counties' ability to provide basic services to residents, destroying the economic base of the State and stripping property owners of their constitutional rights.\nYear after year, initiatives and bills were introduced; each time, they either failed to garner enough signatures, or green legislators managed to kill them in committee.\n\nA funny thing happened\n\nThen a funny thing happened on the way to the voting booth in 1994. Tired of a Democratic legislature and a Democratic governor that refused to acknowledge or deal with the onslaught of onerous and oppressive laws aimed at controlling every square inch of land in Washington State, the PEOPLE had had enough.\nEvery single Republican candidate was re-elected. Liberal minded Democrats were ousted, and, for the first time in many years, Republicans controlled both the State House and the Senate. Initiative 164 was immediately introduced, and citizens, tired of government oppression, signed as fast as they could,\nries of how government regulations were denying them the use of their land and destroying their lives. And for the first time, legislators listened.\n\nOverwhelming margin\n\nThe Private Property Regulatory Fairness Act (I-164) passed the House by an overwhelming margin and went on to the Senate where the outcome was not so predictable.\n\nThe media attacked I-164 as an effort by evil developers to rape and pillage, and environmentalists launched a major lobbying and mail campaign in an attempt to halt the momentum of the property rights movement and retain their control over land use issues. It didn't work.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 19, 1995, the Washington Senate passed the Private Property Regulatory Fairness At (I-164) and it became law. The greenies can still launch an initiative campaign to halt I164 from being implemented and force it to a vote of the people, but, for now, Washington State has passed the strongest, most wide-sweeping property rights bill in the nation.\n\n\nAmong other things, I-164 forces all regulatory agencies to do a complete economic analysis of any proposed regulation that affects land use; defines \"general public use\" as any regulation that restricts land use, including wetlands, wildlife habitat, or other public benefit; forces agencies to compensate landowner for any diminution of property values, and refers to \"full compensation\" for any reduction in the fair market value.\nThe most important aspect of I-164 is the inclusion of water rights. \"Private property\" is defined as; (1) land, (2) any interest in land or improvements thereof, (3) any proprietary water right, (4) any crops, forest products, or resources capable of being harvested or extracted.\n\"Any restraint of land use\" is defined as \"any action, requirement, or restriction by a government entity, other than actions to prevent or abate public nuisances, that limits the use or development of private property.\"\n\nSection 7 directs any litigation brought by property owners to the Supreme Court of Washington State and provides recovery of litigation costs and reasonable attorney fees for any \"prevailing plaintiff.\"\nSection 8 states that \"if any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held valid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.\"\n\nHard fought and hard won\n\nThis was a battle hard fought and hard won for the citizens of Washington State. But the fight has just begun. Over half of Washington State residents are concentrated on the I-5 Corridor, which extends from Bellingham in the north to Vancouver to the south.\n\nIf property rights advocates lose the public relations battle, the enviros can gather the necessary 90,000 signatures to place the bill on the public ballot in November. Right now the greenies are reeling from the shock of I-164's passage, but it is certain that they will regroup to fight again.\n\nContinued on page 7\n\nMay 1995",

A classic example is the way in which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service administrates the Endangered Species Act. Despite a clear intent by Congress that the Act not be used to regulate activity on private property, Fish and Wildlife has promulgated a whole set of rules governing private land use that it deems harmful to a listed species. Mountain States Legal Foundation contends, however, that Congress is precluded by Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution from delegating such powers to another branch of government. In an amicus curiae brief filed before the Supreme Court in the case of Bruce Babbitt vs. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon, Mountain States argues, \"A delegation doctrine that allows Congress to abdicate its power to define the elements of a criminal offense in favor of an unelected administrative agency .. . does violence to the time-honored separation of powers principle.\"\n\nOf their own choice\n\nJames Madison observed, \"It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be . . so incoherent that they cannot be understood, if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be tomorrow.\" James Bovard, author of Lost Rights: the Destruction of American Liberty, clearly shares Madison's concern. He wrote, \"The more often government officials change the rules by which individuals will be judged, the more those individuals will be left to the government's mercy, since most citizens do not know and cannot understand the laws and regulations they must obey.\" What has been lost is a fundamental governing philosophy, eloquently expressed by Henry Lee at Virginia's constitutional convention in 1788: \"When a question arises with respect to the legality of any power, exercised or assumed . . . it is plainly on the side of the governed.\"\n\nJoanna Waugh serves on the executive committee of Stop Taking Our Property (STOP) in Porter County, Indiana, and is a board member for the Land Rights Foundation.

        "text": "Earth's 'peril' an exaggeration\n\n\nJeff Jacoby\n\nWhat if they gave a funeral and nobody was dead? The first Earth Day in 1970 was a dismal dirge, a spree of keening and groaning over the planet's demise. Mother Nature was in her grave, cried the doomsayers and we - her murderers - were going to pay terribly for our crime.\n\"In a decade,\" predicted Life magazine, \"urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution ... By 1985, air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the earth by one-half.\"\nPaul Ehrlich, the population alarmist, forecast a \"Great Die-Off,\" in which 4 billion people would perish of famine. Then Sen. Walter Mondale warned that the oceans were \"so polluted that scientists predict the end of their productivity in 10 to 20 years.\"\n\nAbandon hope\n\nAbandon hope, advised The Progressive. The \"new Four Horsemen - Overpopulation, Pollution, the Famine of Resources and Nuclear War - are riding relentlessly on their mission of destruction,\" Newsweek held out a slightly more optimistic possibility - that mankind faced not total extinction, but \"mutation into some human equivalent of the carp now lurking in Lake Erie's fetid depths, living off poison.\"\n\nSo here we are a quarter-century later, about to mark Earth Day 25, not wearing gas masks, not dead of famine or nuclear incineration, not having mutated into human carp - and the environmental apocalyptics are more hysterical than ever. The grim scenarios pour forth, growing more desperate and frightful with each repetition. Global warming, nuclear winter, overpopulation, deforestation, ozone depletion, air pollution, acid rain, carcinogens, solid waste, resource depletion, biotechnological disaster, food shortages - horrors confront us at every turn. Catastrophe looms.\n\nLaughing stocks\n\nOnce people who claimed the world would end if mankind didn't repent became laughingstocks. Now they become vice president. (\"Unless we quickly and profoundly change the course of our civilization, we face an immediate and grave\ndanger of destroying the worldwide ecological system that sustains life as we know it\" - Al Gore.)\nYet for all the panic and all the eulogies, Mother Nature is alive and well. Human beings live safer, healthier, cleaner, longer lives than ever before. This blessed plot, this Earth is mostly is good shape.\n\nYou're skeptical?\n\n> Only a system based on private ownership creates incentives to use resources efficiently and conserve them for the future.\n\nYou're skeptical? Pick up The True State of the Planet, a new collection of essays on the earth's condition by 11 environmental scholars. A project of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a sci-ence-and-economics think tank, \"The True State of the Planet\" is a data-filled survey that calmly exposes the scariest ecological bugaboos for the alarmist froth they are.\nPollyannish this volume isn't. It details the severe strain on ocean fisheries, for example, and devotes many pages to the global waste of water. Still, on most fronts, the good news outweighs the bad. A sample:\n\nCancer. That epidemic of cancer spawned by artificial chemicals? A myth. Except for lung cancer, which is primarily caused by smoking, cancer death rates have been declining for decades, most dramatically in Europe and North America. Less than one-10th of one percent of the pesticides in our food are artificial, and they pose no measurable risk to human health.\n\nForests. America's forests have been expanding, not receding, since 1920. In 1850, only a third of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut was covered with forest; today those states are 60 percent forested. Some 4 million seedlings are planted daily in America, and almost all wood harvested here and in Europe comes from tree plantations, not old-growth forests.\n\nGlobal warming. Computer climate modeling is still very primitive, but the weight of evidence is against the existence of a global warming crisis. While global temperature records show a warming of .54 degrees celsius since 1881 , nearly 70 percent of the warming took place before 1930 - i.e. - before any buildup of greenhouse gases. And since 1979, the earth's atmosphere has actually cooled by 0.13 degrees.\nE Hunger. Food has never - never been cheaper or more plentiful. In the Third World, food production is increasing at more than twice the rate of population growth. Since 1980 alone, world food prices have dropped by an astonishing 57 percent, as crop yields become ever more abundant. Only 5 percent of the world's people, mostly in Africa, are at risk of famine - and that is because of war or authoritarian government policies, not drought.\nFreedom is a recurring theme in The True State of the Planet. Because ownership promotes stewardship, there is a strong connection between property rights and environmental protection. Only market economics can generate the wealth needed to pay for environmental protection. And only a system based on private ownership creates incentives to use resources efficiently and conserve them for the future. That, too, contradicts scare tactic environmentalism, which routinely paints economic growth as bad and government control as good.\n\nFor 25 years, sensible environmentalism has been drenched in the hype and fearmongering of the prophets of doom. Need we waste any more time listening to these frauds and liars? Earth Day is coming up, after all. And we've got a lot to celebrate.\n\n\nReprinted with permission from The Boston Globe Thursday, April 20, 1995",

        "text": "Sierra Slander Sparks Spat Maine's Jim Longley Fights Back\n\n\nJames Longley, Jr., son of former independent Maine Governor James Longley, was elected last November as a Republican to represent Maine's First Congressional District. He endorsed the Contract with America during his campaign. Subsequently he has supported HR 450, The Regulatory Transition Act; HR 925, The Private Property Protection Act; and HR 1022, The Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Act.\nIn mid March, the Sierra Club bought a series of radio ads attacking Representative Longley, using their usual venal claptrap to accuse him of favoring polluters, making it harder to protect fish stocks from industrial pollution, and supporting transfer of control of federal health and safety regulations to industrial polluters. Representative Longley held a press conference in Augusta, Maine, the state capitol, on March 31, delivering the following response:\n\nIt's not an accident that the Sierra Club chose a week that I was in Washington, and unable to defend myself, to attack me. That's the kind of people they are, and that's the way they operate, with a form of environmental thuggery that seeks to bully and intimidate anyone who seeks to challenge their impractical and elitist notions of how to best protect our environment.\n\nThey've chosen to attack me for, among other things, my support of three important pieces of legislation, including:\nHR 450, The Regulatory Transition Act - a bill which would establish a moratorium on new regulations until Congress can complete its review of our entire regulatory framework. With over 80,000 pages of federal regulations adopted last year, on top of over a $1,000,000$ pages of regulations already in place, it's time to say \"time out\" and reassess some of the strategies that we are pursuing to see if they are working or not.\nHR 925, The Private Property Protection Act - when decisions made by unaccountable and un-elected bureaucrats prevent landowners from legitimately using their land, the government should be responsible for some level of compensation to affected citizens. When Maine people can't harvest their forest land, when they can't build homes or\n\n\nby David Guernsey\n\nbusinesses, when they can't even sell their land as a result of governmental action-all in the name of protectionthen they can't build a better future for themselves and their children, and the balance between environment and the economy has been broken.\nHR 1022, The Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Act - Unlike the Sierra Club, I have great respect for the 65,000 Maine citizens who signed petitions and who know a costly and ineffective automobile inspection program when they see it. What the special interests and the bureaucrats haven't told us is that if this legislation had been in effect in 1990, Maine would have been saved the long, arduous, and now expensive, burden of first adopting, and now repealing, Maine's auto emissions testing program because the law would have required hard scientific justification of the problem to be solved and actual, not projected, results to be achieved.\nI'm also pushing to get these committees to come to Maine so that they, and the public, can see first hand, the damage that's been done to the environmental movement by a group of self righteous bureaucrats all in the name of their\nown conceited, arrogant and self-serving view of the world.\nAs I said, this is an unvarnished attempt by a group of environmental thugs to intimidate me and stop me from challenging their sacred cows.\n\nThey won't succeed and I won't quit.\nNo members of the print media from Representative Longley's district attended the press conference, nor did any of them pick up the AP story, though the Bangor Daily News in Maine's Second District and a Washington column did cover the story. Only the Land Rights Letter correspondent had any questions for Mr. Longley, specifically asking what he might do to stop such abuses of tax exempt funds. While not specifically responding to that question, Representative Longley stated that Congress was looking into the substantial public funds which have been channeled into private non-profit coffers by various schemes.\n\nAnyone wishing to contact Representative Longley on these issues can write to him at 226 Cannon Office Building, Washington, DC 20515 or call at 202-225-6116\n\nRadio attack ads backfire on club\n\nThe Sierra Club, a national environmental group, is way out of line in its current radio advertising campaign against Rep. James Longley Jr.\nThe organization is running 30 -second ads in the form of a quiz program \"You Bet Your Health!\" that faults the 1st District Republican for failing to support legislation the group says would fight water pollution in Maine.\nThe whole thing is done in such a crudely mocking tone that the messagewhat there is of one- is lost in the histrionics. A \"game show announcer,\" presumably symbolizing the Sierra Club, is loud and obnoxious. The \"contestant\" is imbecilic. Listeners at home are treated like simpletons.\nWhy the Sierra Club would choose to conduct a campaign-style negative attack on a freshman congressman from Maine just three months into his first term is baffling.\nLongley may be open to legitimate criticism for his votes on environmental matters, but this sort of assault does not qualify. It is too offensive to persuade him to change, if that's the idea, and only puts him on the defensive. It insults the intelligence of Maine people, creates sympathy for the object of its attack and only makes the Sierra Club look like the \"environmental thugs\" that Longley called them.\nThe real victim of this pointless exercise is the reputation of the Sierra Club itself.\n\n\nReprinted with permission, Morning Sentinel, Wednesday, April 5, 1995",

        "text": "Adirondack assault continues\n\n> These initiatives are not about the environment, but rather about money and control.\n\nThe Lake Champlain Management Conference (LCMC) which evolved into the Lake Champlain Basin Program is nearing the end of its five year study and recommendation period. The Lake Champlain basin covers an area of over 8,000 square miles in Vermont, New York and Quebec, Canada. It was brought to life by the \"Lake Champlain Special Designation Act of 1990 .\" It was to be funded by up to $\\$ 5$ million per year for the five years. Actually over $\\$ 15$ million has been spent so far. In 1990 Senators Leahy and Jeffords and Congressman Sanders of Vermont kicked off this effort at an environmental feeding frenzy in Burlington, Vermont. Socialist Congressman Bernie Sanders (at least he admits it) stated, \"We have to clean up the Lake regardless of the cost.\" This is a testimonial to the current politics of Vermont that a Socialist has such enduring support. Most of the impetus and the direction that have driven this program have come from the Vermont side of the lake.\n\nFive years of studies\n\nFive years of studies were conducted on Lake Champlain, which outside of the Great Lakes is the second largest lake in the nation. Unfortunately for the enviro's, little in the way of toxic pollution was found. Fish that were tested were not dangerously full of toxics, heavy metals, etc. Panic set in. The Basin Program regulatory recommendations were already written but the lake wasn't cooperating. The focus shifted. Desperate for a crisis, the bureaucratic porkers at the trough and their allies in the environmental industries and government turned their attention to the plant nutrient, phosphorous. The south portion of the lake which is shallow with a heavy clay bottom and shoreline has high levels of phosphorous. I say that, using their terminology. There is no base from which to measure this nutrient as being high, low or normal. Also some bays and other isolated spots tested high in phosphorous. The LCMC hung their hats on phosphorous. But, as we studied the data, it became apparent that the south lake phosphorous was not caused by runoff in the streams. All streams flowing into the lake, at least on the New York side, showed only minute levels of phosphorous. In the main portion of the lake, the phosphorous was at approximately the same level as it was in Lake Ontario. Recent reports had indicated that Lake Ontario was so low in phosphorous that there was a possible danger to sustaining the food chain.\nUndaunted, the Basin Program forged ahead with a restoration and pollution prevention program. If there is one thing we have learned in five years of following such programs, it is that these initiatives are not about the environment, but rather about money and control. In their publication, \"Opportunities for Action,\" the LCMC outlines a course of action to destroy farmers, bankrupt communities and reduce landowners to serfs on their own land. Admittedly, one has to read between the lines, and it also helps if you start at the back of these publications. The authors expect that most readers will not get that far. The real kicker did not come from that publication though. We found the \"good stuff\" in the \"Report on Institutional Arrangements for Watershed Management of the Lake Champlain Basin.\" With a title like that most people would not bother to go beyond the cover except under conditions of extreme insomnia. In here we find \"... enhance cooperative relationships between and within governmental and non-governmental organizations with a stake ....\" Just who are these stakeholders? They are government agencies and the environmental industries. Land owners are not included. We also find the statement, \"There are a number of 'flashpoints' that can disrail, disrupt and distort a management effort. These include home rule, private property rights and perceived faimess ....\"\n\nFlash points???\n\nFlashpoints??? These issues used to be considered as representative of Constitutional rights and good governance, not as possible considerations for derailment of programs which the program framers already know are not well suited for a country with a Constitution that places the citizen as the ultimate sovereign. This publication also mentions that substantial funding is expected from fees and fines. Fees that weren't required before and\nfines for actions that were not previously illegal. There are also provisions for acquisition of thousands of acres of sensitive wetlands. A policy formulation commission is to be established with 14 members. Eleven from government, ie. Federal, Vermont, New York and Canada, and three from citizens committees to be selected by these eleven.\n\nWe reacted!\n\nWe reacted!! If the beleaguered people of the Adirondacks accepted this, then everyone would be coming here trying to sell us bridges. Recent public hearings actually, listening sessions - were held. (Listening sessions were first choreographed by the Northern Forest Lands Council (NFLC) when the Adirondackers ate their lunch, in more ways than one, but that is another story. And choreograph is an appropriate term when we consider the many dances tried by the NFLC to find \"common ground.\")\nListening sessions are when the culprits sit in the audience trying to blend in, rather than in a panel formation at the front of the room where they could answer questions on specifics of their proposals and then duck tomatoes. It is a relatively new approach at crowd control. Opposition to the program is running at about $90 \\%$ on the New York side. Our Representatives Gerald Solomon and John McHugh have heard the cry, not just from the property rights groups, but also from the Farm Bureau, marina owners, chambers of commerce and communities all over the region.\nSeveral communities have passed resolutions opposing this Federal control scheme. If our representatives can cut off the funding, it will be a particularly ugly time at the trough. We do expect, however, that some of these initiatives will be funded from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) which has billions available. ISTEA is written so that funding is allowed for anything from sandal shops to snowshoe makers (and that is another story) ... it never ends.\nIn the face of these onslaughts, we will remain vigilant and uncompromising in our opposition. The good citizens of our region and indeed across America have compromised enough!\n\nDale French is Chairman of the Adirondack Solidarity Alliance located at Rt. 1, Box 202B, Crown Point, New York.

They continually labeled the members of the NHLA as \"anti-environmentalists,\" when our only \"crimes\" are that we believe that our rivers are already well protected, and that private property owners can do a better job of taking care of their land than the federal government can.\nAbout the only argument that the NPS could muster in favor of designation was the \"honor\" involved in becoming part of the National Park System, which brings to mind an old story. Remember the one about the man who was tarred and feathered and about to be run out of town on a mule? He said that if it wasn't for the honor, he would just as soon walk!\nIf the NPS had any credibility left, it was demolished at the joint hearing be-\nfore the U.S. House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Lands and the House Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, where it was revealed that the NPS has been unable to produce auditable financial statements for the past three years.\nRep. Helen Chenoweth of Idaho said that officials for private sector companies \"would be fired and behind bars\" if they kept such poor financial records. Rep. Linda Smith of Washington compared the NPS to a bankrupt company that should be placed in receivership.\n\nLesson to be learned\n\nIf there is any lesson to be learned from the attempts by the NPS and the environmental establishment to federally designate the Pemigewasset and Merrimack Rivers under the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, it is that by getting organized, by publicizing the facts, and by using just plain common sense, the NPS and the environmental establishment can be beaten every time.\n\nDave Tardif is a director of the New Hampshire Landowners Alliance.

United States.\n\nEASTER, FAITH AND THE GREEN POLICE\n\nFrom an editorial in the Washington Times on 4/19/95, \"This Sunday the U.S. Park Police decided to go after Public Enemy No. 1 ... Namely, parking violators who are in church.\" A sunrise service (6:30 A.M.) held at the Lincoln Memorial netted 120 parking tickets at $\\$ 50$ a pop, the great majority of which were written during the service. According to the Rev. Amos Dodge, \"If they had just had a motorcycle cop there in the morning this wouldn't have happened\". As it happened the \"P-Men\" surrounded the place.\n\"The signs are very clear\" announced a smug Sgt. C. Braun. \"People who are attending an event are made aware of where they're not allowed to park.\" And as the Times writer went on \"Yes well, that's the point isn't it? Just to let 'people' know who's in charge, you give tickets.\" It should be noted that the policy, at least until now, always has been to not ticket on Sunday. With all the noise about separation of Church and State it seems that the feds would like a religious extermination policy or at least one of open harassment. Lest we forget, wasn't this country founded to end these abuses?\n\nOF MICROSOFT, AND MEN\n\nAccording to Network News (Oregon Lands Coalition) 3/27/95\nMicrosoft, in collusion with the World Wildlife Fund, has embarked on a project to produce on CD-ROM the title Dangerous Creatures, promoting the message that human beings are the deadliest creatures on the planet.

But, according to an Insight report ( $4 / 25 / 94$ ), Arizona State Senator Peter Goudinoff has come up with a novel reason to oppose lessening the tax burden in Arizona: If Arizona cuts taxes, then Arizona citizens will have more taxable income and have to pay the IRS more in taxes. Thus a $\\$ 101$ million tax cut becomes only a $\\$ 79$ million tax cut. This, Goudinoff apparently believes, is enough reason to have no tax cut at all. Who elects these people?????\n\nPRIME TIME SLIME\n\nPrime-time television has never been known for its accuracy or commitment to fairness, but one recent hit called Sea Quest is plunging the old boob-tube to new depths. The show takes place on board a submarine in the year 2018 and according to the group, Media Watch, spends most of its time propelling modern environmental myths. Sea Quest informs its viewers, for example, that within a few short years, beef consumption will have to be banned because of the effect of cattle flatulence on the ozone layer, and that industrial pollution will soon taint $90 \\%$ of our drinking water. The show has also torpedoed corporate America and made the assertion that environmental regulations are flooded with corruption. Sounds like these folks need to surface for some air! Excerpted from C-Fact Citizen Outlook 12/94\n\nGOOD NEWS?\n\nIt has become more apparent lately that the green media monsters are beginning to have to take the truths that we have known all along into account, even in their own publications.

Wayne Allard (R-CO) recently uncovered a plot by the USDA to spy on private landowners. It seems the USDA had issued a memo directing its field employees to make Endangered Species evaluations on routine farm visits, and not tell the folks who owned the land. This plan was cooked up in an agreement with the EPA. The memo which caused all the trouble stated \"EPA needs this information to determine how to best protect species from potentially harmful pesticides ...
