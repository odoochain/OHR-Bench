        "text": "The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology plays a critical supporting role in maintaining the health readiness of our forces deployed in the Global War on Terror. For soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, a rapid, accurate diagnosis from the experts at the AFIP means better medical treatment and a faster, safer return to duty.\n\nThe AFIP's multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis helps to ensure that our service members, and their families here at home, receive the finest health care available. In 2004, AFIP's worldclass staff made the initial diagnosis in over 8,700 cases contributed by military treatment facilities, and made a major diagnostic change in 196 others, directly impacting patient treatment options.\n\nThe AFIP is poised to address future military challenges with the world's largest repository of tissue and tumor specimens, molecular and genetic techniques to combat disease, case-based education offerings for military health care providers, and scientific laboratories that provide a full range of new and evolving diagnostic and therapeutic aids to DoD hospital laboratories.\n\nThe AFIP has time and again proven to be an essential resource for military medical pro-grams-for the US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the DoD Global Emerging Infections System, to name just a few. I look forward to the Institute's continued development of technology and resources in support of military medical operations around the globe.\n\nLTG Kevin C.

        "text": "The Director's Message\n\nIn 2004, the AFIP continued the dynamic challenge of\n transforming services and realigning resources to meet the requirements of present and future missions. How will we support military medicine in 2005, 2010, and even 2020? I expect that 3 very promising initiatives currently under development at the Institute will play a crucial role in the future of military and civilian medicine.\n\nThe first, tissue microarrays (TMA), utilizes our vast repository of 50 million paraffin-embedded blocks and 10 million formalin-fixed tissue specimens. The creation of one unique slide from multiple pathology cases will provide significant opportunities to enhance research and education.\n\nThe second initiative is the AFIP Telepathology Program in direct support of the Army Telemedicine Program. In the last year alone, with 26 real-time systems deployed around the world, military cases increased from 268 to 373 . Telemedicine offers a practical, cost-saving alternative for military pathologists and physicians in need of our services, and has tremendous potential for biodefense and homeland security.\n\nOur third initiative is Ask AFIP ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$, a Web-based program that premieres in the summer of 2005. Ask AFIPTM will link several of the Institute's unique assets, including case materials, authoritative publications by AFIP staff, and museum collections, to provide an innovative educational experience to military and civilian pathologists, radiologists, and related specialists.\n\nThese initiatives, and a strong foundation of world-class pathology expertise, ensure that the AFIP will have a critical role in support of military missions over the next 15 years.\n\nThis annual report gives an overview of the critical support the AFIP provided to deployed military personnel around the globe during 2004, including forensic investigations, identifying and treating infectious disease and environmental threats, offering advanced telemedicine, courses, and distance learning for military medical personnel, and collaborating on almost 200 pathology research protocols. Next year, we will continue to focus on restructuring and realigning.\n\nWhatever the mission, wherever the need, the AFIP will use the newest advances in technology, communication, and diagnostics to provide the world's finest pathology and related services to our military personnel and the civilian medical community.",

Through comprehensive forensic services, DNA identifications, and mortality surveillance programs, the OAFME provides unique and invaluable support to the DoD, our service members, and their families.\n\nOur staff is committed to giving a full account of every military member who dies in service to their country. In 2004, the most challenging year in the history of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, our MEs deployed to the Dover Port Mortuary more than 200 days and undertook almost 1,100 death investigations.\n\nContributing to Force Protection\n\nOur autopsy examinations and consultations provide realtime protection against battlefield threats, especially for troops deployed to Iraq. Through onsite investigations, our MEs have correlated tourniquet use with reduced mortality, and pattern injuries with enemy weaponry and personnel configurations in armored vehicles.\n\nOur Ballistics Research Range plays a major role in testing and developing new-generation body armor, such as a new land mine boot, and in conducting research on battlefield injuries, including a new penetrating wound sensor. In 2004 we received a $\\$ 3.9 \\mathrm{M}$ grant from the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency to develop new imaging technologies as part of the Joint Combat Trauma Registry.",

Members of the department are ready to deploy within 4 hours of notification. Using state-of-the-art digital technology, they can complete rapid, accurate dental identification within hours of a postmortem examination, facilitating the timely return of remains to the family.\n\nThe OAFME's forensic work is further enhanced by the Department of Radiologic Pathology, whose DARPA-supported Virtual Autopsy is the only CT autopsy program in the United States. Using digital technology, the Virtual Autopsy can extract previously inaccessible information, document the paths of bullets and other projectiles in 3D, and correlate this information with the use and design of protective body armor.",

In 2004, our world-class facility processed over 17,400 DNA samples, 1,700 of which supported the identification of fallen troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) is the military's exclusive resource for forensic identification of fallen American service members, and the world leader in employing mitochondrial DNA typing methods to identify long-missing human remains. In 2004, AFDIL used DNA technology to provide genetic leads in dozens of forensic investigations for the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, providing certainty for countless family members.\n\n$\\square$ References $\\square$ Specimens\n\n\nBlood specimen cards",
