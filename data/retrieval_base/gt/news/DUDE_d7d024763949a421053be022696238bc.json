She lead, through example, by overcoming the grief and suffering of war to give courage, example and forgiveness to others.\n\nWhen Jim Houston asked if I would speak to you I blanched at the thought of what a judge might have to add to such a dramatic story. The answer is-nothing that dramatic. But even for a stodgy Judge God has forced me into situations where the magnificence of his presence has been undeniably clear. Part of this revelation has been through friends like your own Dr. James Houston.\n\nAnother source was through a remarkable friend and neighbor, Dr. Willi Unsoeld, who taught at a local college, had an earned Doctorate in Theology and Philosophy and was also one of a two man team who were the first persons to climb the North face of Mt. Everest. We belonged to a small fellowship group in Olympia where Willi occasionally sent out thought pieces intended as the lead in to our discussions. In one he spoke of his increasing failure to experience encounters with the sacred in traditional places of worship but found that experience among the bare austerities of God's high places.\n\nHis launching point for the discussion was a small classic by Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy. There Otto attempted an analysis of those qualities of the sacred of which we had traditionally been aware. He broke his analysis into an examination of the mystery, power and fascination with the Holy. Old Testament stories spoke of this power.

He described our fear of the power of the wholly as in part dependent on a limitation of our own wisdom as to the extent of that power, and described this uncertainty as the origin of that fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wisdom. Willi found evidence of that power in the unscaled mountains of this world and described it as the type of power which convinced us we were no longer in charge of our destiny.\n\nNow I must confess that I never ventured into the high mountains with Willi. I always said to my self that it was due to bad knees but the whole truth is that even the small bit of climbing I did convinced me that there had to be other ways to find the presence of God that were not quite as terrifying. Little did I know that my love of sailing would lead to similar experiences.\n\nMy wife and I bought a sailboat before we bought a house. It has always been a great source of joy and adventure for me. Over the course of the years friends would ask if I ever had sailed to Hawaii. I would reply no, but that I intended to one day. Finally it became apparent that I would go only if I established a scenario I could not back out of and so I registered for the 1976 Victoria to Maui race, the first of four I would subsequently participate in. Only one of our crew had previous Ocean experience and as the skipper, I had absolutely none. I was not quite certain what I would find and suspected that Columbus's crew were correct that the world was indeed flat with a great waterfall at the end over which all intrepid mariners would fall. I recall thinking that the race would be a wonderful opportunity to experience that same type of experience that Willi had in his adventures in the sky. Nothing of the miraculous happened except that we survived a number of strong storms which eliminated a number of the competing boats. I quickly realized that there are no large boats on the Ocean and that the power of God's sea was of the nature of that dangerous power of which we can never be",

One morning just as dawn broke on the ocean I was at the helm of the boat steering down towering seas with the spinnaker set, catapulting us down that face of one wave after another. I found myself singing at the top of my lungs songs from earlier days in Sunday School that I thought I had entirely forgotten. They were IThis is my Fathers WorldI and IThere is a Wideness to God's Mercy like the Wideness of the Sea. There is not time this morning to go over all the words to those magnificent hymns but a few lines will suffice. The last verse of This is my Father's world, after recognizing his handiwork in all about us in the first three, affirms: IThis is my father's world, O let me ne'er forget. That though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the Ruler yet. This is my Father's world: the battle is not done; Jesus who died shall be satisfied, and earth and heaven be one.\n\nThe second hymn, There is a Wideness to God's Mercy, speaks so eloquently of the mystery of the forgiveness of God. The first and last verses capture the essence of that message. They say IThere is a wideness in God's mercy Like the Wideness of the sea; There's a kindness in his justice Which is more than liberty. If our love were but more simple, We should take him at his word. And our lives would be all sunshine in the sweetness of our Lord I As I reflected after the conclusion of the race about my lack of a life changing mystical experience, I realized that in the words of these two simple hymns could be found much of the wonder and mystery that Otto was referring to.\n\nBut later experiences in dealing with children and adults in court convinced me that the overwhelming power of the Holy is found not only in nature, but in the lives of his creation",

Don Anthony White killed two innocent people in Seattle a few days after his release from the reformatory. He was a young black man with an I.Q. of over 180 who had serious mental health problems. Before his tenth birthday, those who participated in treatment programs with White, predicted he would seriously injure or kill someone. After spending substantial time in juvenile treatment facilities, White was eventually committed to the State reformatory. Following a short term at the reformatory, White was released and while enroute back to Seattle, he pointed to a State mental hospital, stating that he belonged in the hospital rather than on the streets of Seattle.\n\nAt the time of his first trial, White was so out of control that his attorney, seated next to him in the courtroom, feared for his own life. The jury was quick to enter a verdict of guilty and concluded that the death sentence would be imposed. The verdict followed testimony that White was irreversibly psychotic. At the end of that trial, White had enough insight into hi/s acts to comment to his attorney that Idying is not enough and that he was prepared to do what he could to help society understand the reasons for what occurred. The first trial judge failed to inquire into White's ability to participate in his own defense at that trial and eight years later the federal courts granted him a new trial. One of the principal witness in the Federal habeas-corpus proceeding was the first trial judge who testified that White was his own worst enemy, a wanton and brutal person. Had White acted as he did three years later at the federal court hearing, the trial judge believed he would not have been given the death penalty in the state court. Finally, the judge stated: As I observed, I could see no evidence of",

As an active Catholic layman be believed that the presence of one person who could bring the reality of god's love to White might have an impact no one else could. He soon was joined by the Archbishop of the area for the Catholic church. Visits were also made by members of many faiths. During this time there were remarkable changes in White. He studied architecture and became an accomplished painter, able to portray in painting many of the conflicts that tormented his soul.\n\nFollowing the reversal of his first conviction by the federal court, I presided at the second trial. The evidence was much the same as in the first trial except White admitted he committed the murders. His appearance and demeanor were remarkably different. When his attorney attempted to enter a plea that he was not guilty by reason of mental irresponsibility at the time of the act, yet safe to be at-large, White refused to enter the plea, stating he was not yet safe to be at-large. The jury observed these changes and although a verdict of guilty was entered, took only a short time to conclude the death penalty should not be imposed.\n\nWhite subsequently served out his life sentence with time allowed off for good behavior. After his release he successfully integrated into the community. During his time in prison, he graduated from high school and correspondence school. Later he was on the dean's list of a college in the town where the prison was located. Most telling was that on his release, While",

It was the only capital case I heard as a trial judge. It left me with the strong impression that at no point in the life of a human being are we wise enough to say a person is beyond redemption and that the only alternative, in an effort to protect society, is the imposition of the death penalty. I viewed the imposition of a life sentence with no possibility of parole as a better alternative. It also opened my eyes to the possibilities that forgiveness can bring. White was able to reclaim a life that would have been thrown away.\n\nThe impact of this trial stayed with me for the remainder of my thirty year career on the bench, twenty four of these on our highest Appellate court. Following the ruling of the United States Supreme Court in the early 1980's which made imposition of the death penalty again possible in state courts, our state Supreme Court heard approximately twenty four cases where the death penalty was imposed. I dissented to each of those cases on law related grounds and was upheld on review by our federal courts in all but one of those cases. After viewing the futility of our procedures for imposing the death sentence I began to question whether I could even remain a part of a system which I was convinced was fatally flawed.\n\nEven though my dissents were successful, I had to face the issue of whether my participation in the system gave it a credibility it did not deserve. After twenty four years on our Supreme Court I resigned from that position in 1995 as I believed our system to be fatally flawed. Time and time again, before and after my resignation, the United States has proven that no human is wise enough to say when another is without redemptive possibilities and that the death penalty is not the answer to our crime problem, given the possibility of an erroneous verdict.",

When Betty and I were traveling in South Africa a few years ago I had great hopes of meeting some of their judges. The courts in South Africa, were in many instances, a bulwark against the worst practices of apartheid. As happens to many of my plans, this did not work out. The time we were in South Africa was the exact time the judges took their vacations and, when judges take vacations, they are really gone. As we left on our flight to Johannesburg from Capetown, the only seat on the airplane that was open was next to me. Just before takeoff, a tall distinguished black man came in and occupied the seat. As we became acquainted I found his name was Fikili Bam and that he was the Chief Judge of the Land Redistribution Court, a vital part in the rehabilitation taking place. While still in his teens he was outraged by the Sharpstown Massacres and concluded that armed rebellion was the only way to resolve the problems in South Africa. He followed this path for a few years, setting up cells of militants who would assist in the armed struggle he was certain would come. He was arrested in his early twenties while a law student of the University of Cape Town, turned in by an informer in his cell group. The next fifteen years were spent on Robben Island, the prison island in the middle of the bay in Capetown harbor. His mentor was Nelson Mandela who shared with him the same birthday. On Robben island the weather was almost always misty and windswept. Bedding consisted of a straw mat with the cells so cold that blankets provided so little warmth that the inmates always slept fully dressed. June and July were the bleakest months with winter in the air and constant rain with the temperature seldom above forty degrees Fahrenheit. Work during the days consisted of",

One of the most remarkable changes occurred when a barbaric commandeer named Badenhorst was being transferred from the island. In his departure interview with his superiors, Mandela was present. When Mandela finished reciting along list of complaints against the man in the presence of his Senior officer, the man replied by saying \"I just want to wish you people good luck.\" Mandela recounts that he thought about this moment for a long time afterward. Badenhorst had perhaps been the most callous and barbaric commanding officer they had had on Robben Island, but that the event was a useful reminder that all men, even the most seemingly cold-blooded, have a core of decency, and that if their heart is touched, they are capable of changing.\n\nAnd it was in his daily contact with Mandela that Judge Bam had an unusual opportunity to become better acquainted and to be guided by his strong but gentle spirit. He told of the daily beatings, of forced labor and inadequate food, of the contempt and hostility of the guards and administration for much of his stay. When I asked him about his faith, he recounted that although he was a Christian as a boy, he was not now actively practicing any faith but every evening, while on Robbin Island would sing to himself the Christian hymns of his childhood. When I asked him about his single most vivid experience in his imprisonment he reflected for a while. He finally said that those who had served for a substantial time on the Island left with no bitterness due to the example of Mandela, but that those who had only stayed a short time and could not be shaped by time by Mandela's spirit, left with was great bitterness. They had not reached the point where they had to depend on the occurrences of the Holy, rather than themselves.\n\nIn South Africa an entire nation is struggling with whether forgiveness is possible on a massive scale.

He urged people not to offer simplistic explanations of suffering saying Nothing makes religion so unattractive as the kind of people who come around sa say. It's God's will. Tutu puts the events of Don White's life into perspective by noting that forgiveness is releasing the perpetrator into the possibility of a new beginning.\n\nCentral to Tutu's theology is a God who suffers with the sufferer. He relates the story in the Book of Daniel where three friends are throw into the fiery furnace by the King. The king approaches the furnace and see four figures. Tutu affirms that the God I believe in is a dying God who dies with us. As a Christian, I would say dies and rises.\n\nHe spoke of the lessons taught by Job, one of Jim Houston's great themes, where as he relates, one of the wonderful things about the Book of Job is that it doesn't answer questions. Those friends who were supposed to be Orthodox were saying to Job, You suffer because you're evil. And Job says I know I'm not evil. In the end, God does not give an answer that says You are right. You are wrong. It's Who are you to ask\n\nSome of the themes from Tutus experiences are the Easters after the Good Fridays, and the freedom that can lead to forgiveness. In speaking of his country he observes they could so easily have taken the wrong choice, and they didn't. On the other side of evil is the quite exhilarating realization that people who have gone through'suffering can emerge so human, so humane, so magnanimous, so caring, so ready to forgive.",

Chuck Colson tells of entering a classroom in a prison in Texas where men were discussing the effects of therapy programs on their lives. One man debunked their effects pointing out that he had been through all of them and then went on to describe the difference between therapy, which merely manages problems, and transformation through Jesus Christ, which gives us a new life. It was at that session that Colson described an event he said he would never forget. As he tells it all the inmates were assembled in the gymnasium along with Prison Fellowship volunteers and the prisoners' mentor. The program was for the first six men who completed the entire 18 month program. One of the men who walked toward Colson was Ron Flowers. As he did so, out of the corner of his eye Colson saw a tall, handsome woman who knew to be a Mrs. Washington, get out of her seat and walk over to Ron, and embrace him proudly.\n\nThere was a gasp in the room among the inmates as Mrs. Washington was the mother of the woman Ron flowers had murdered 14 years earlier. Throughout the 14 years Flowers had been in prison, he denied killing her, even saying he had not pulled the trigger. But something had happened in Flower's life. At an earlier program he was encouraged along with others there to acknowledge responsibility for their acts, make restitution to their victims and ask for forgiveness.\n\nAs Ron struggled through the program he finally broke down and confessed that he had been the killer. He then prayed for his victim's family to forgive him.\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Washington received a letter from the parole board saying Ron was up for parole.

We thank him for the power he gives us to love, and with his help, to forgive.
