Particularly, when in Florissant?\n\nLiteral meaning of the word \"Florissant\" is \"flowering.\" And, when it came to thoroughfares—avenues, roads, boulevards, everything but alleys—the name of Florissant \"flowered\" promiscuously hereabouts.\n\nFrom downtown St. Louis to the City of Florissant bloomed forth such off-shoots of the Florissant species as North Florissant ave., just plain Florissant ave., West Florissant ave., Florissant rd., Florissant blvd., Old Florissant rd. and New Florissant rd.\n\nApparently an Outcast\n\nAnd, one two-block street—apparently an outcast—wandered away 17 miles south, as the crow flies, from the City of Florissant to blush relatively unseen in Valley Park as \"Florissant dr.\"\n\nThere are other intriguing factors that could be expected to further confuse a Florissant-befuddled motorist. For example, signs in downtown St. Louis announced \"N. Florissant\"—meaning North Florissant. Other signs in Florissant, some 10 miles away, also indicate \"N. Florissant\"—only it means \"New Florissant.\" And it could mean \"Not Florissant.\"\n\nAlso, for a three block stretch in Jennings the roadway commonly known there as West Florissant ave. is that on the south side of the street, but it is just plain Florissant ave, on the north side, according to street signs.\n\nThe St. Louis County Directory illustrates with confusing exactness the muddle an uninitiated motorist might find himself in.\n\n16 Separate Listings\n\nThe directory offers 16 separate listings of the Florissant thoroughfare family in its alphabetical roster of roads. In addition, under the listings by municipalities, there are about a dozen cities, towns and villages sporting a Florissant rd., blvd., ave. or what-have-you.\n\nAvailable maps disagree in some instances on which Florissant is an avenue, a road, a boulevard, new, old, north or west. And in some instances the house numbering on different Florissants is the same.\n\nArmed with maps, directories, a compass, a good hunting dog and several days' rations, a sharp motorist might be able to find out that:\n\nActually, there are three distinct Florissant thoroughfares, plus the Valley Park street.\n\nThree Thoroughfares\n\n1. The first starts at Mullaphy st. as a continuation of 12th st. It extends north to N. Grand ave. and thence west through Jennings and then north again through the eastern fringe of Ferguson to U. S. Highway 66, where it ends.\n\n2. The second—Old Florissant rd. —intersects Highway 66 about a mile and a half west. Northward it extends into the City of Florissant, where it crosses New Florissant ave. and ends at Florissant st. Southward it extends into Ferguson, becoming Elizabeth ave.\n\n3. The third begins at the Normandy wedge, where it joins with Natural Bridge rd. and extends north through Ferguson, Florissant, crosses U. S. Highway 66 and another mile and one-half west of where Old Florissant intersects the highway. North of the highway it becomes New Florissant rd. and extends northward through the City of Florissant.",
