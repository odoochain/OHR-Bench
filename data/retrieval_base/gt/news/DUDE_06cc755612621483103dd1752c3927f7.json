Carlson, inventor of the technology for office copiers and a longtime supporter of RIT. The announcement was made Friday, Oct. 21, at a dinner hosted by Xerox Corporation to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Carlson's inventhe 50th anniversary of Carlson's inven-\ntion, the process called \"xerography\" that ion, the process called \"xerography\" that creates dry copies of documents.\nProvost Thomas R. Plough noted in making the announcement that imaging science will characterize a world leadership academic programming thrust of RIT. This nationally needed and unique teaching and applied research activity in imaging science, housed within the walls of this new facility, will serve as a fitting memorial to the genius of Chester F Carlson,\" he said\nWhen completed in the fall of 1989, the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science will be the largest academic facility of its kind in North America. Including both classrooms and research facilities, it is designed to serve as an international resource for the imaging community.\n\nAs a scientist-humanitarian, Chester F. Carlson gave the world a process that has revolutionized the distribution of information,'\" said President M. Richard Rose. \"Xerography, a cornerstone of imaging science, has led to applications that have expanded mankind's knowledge and improved our standard of living in fields as diverse as electronic printing and xeroradiography for medical diagnosis.\"\n\n\nGuests including (standing from left) David Kearns, Chairman and chief executive officer of Xerox Corp.; newscaster Walter Cronkite; and RIT Provost Thomas R. Plough attended the 50th anniversary elebration of xerography and the announcement that the Center for Imaging Science would be named for Chester F. Carlson. A special guest was Mrs. Dorris Carlson (seated), Carlson's widow.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Carlson was a member of the Nathaniel Rochester Society and an active supporter of RIT as well\nas other universities and charities, often making donations anonymously. He died in 1968.\n\nAlthough my husband prized his anonymity, I feel he would be proud that RIT chose to name its Center for Imaging Science for him,\" said Mrs. Dorris Carlson, his widow. \"A very large portion of his fortune went to various universities and colleges because he felt education of our young people was so vital to the individual and to the future of our country.\"\nAs a young lawyer and physicist living in Queens in the 1930s, Carlson was frustrated by the costly and time-consuming methods then used to copy documents. He theorized that the phenomena of electrostatics and photoconductivity could be used to produce dry copies of printed materials On Oct. 22, 1938, he and his assistant produced an image on a zinc plate, which he transferred to wax paper, creating a xerographic copy.\n\nAlthough more than 20 companies turned down his idea, telling him it could not be commercialized, the concept was bought by The Haloid Company of Rochester. The copier became such a stunning success that Haloid renamed itself in recognition of its greatest product. Today, it is Xerox Corporation.\n\"Chester Carlson is one of the true pioneering giants of imaging,\" said Rodney Shaw, director of the Center for Imaging Science. \"The timeliness of his invention and the technical evolution it has fostered in the past 50 years are a major reason for the existence of the Center for Imaging Science.\"\n\nRobert Downie to Lead Graphic Arts Campaign\n\n\nRobert H. Downie\nRobert H. Downie, an RIT trustee and president of R.H. Downie Development Inc., an imaging research and investment company in Kenmore, N.Y., will serve as the new chairman of RIT's $\\$ 30$ million Graphic Arts Capital Campaign. The fundraising initiative, part of RIT's $\\$ 100$ milraising initiative, part of RIT's $\\$ 100$ mil-\nlion 'Access to the Future\" capital camlion \"Access to the Future\" capital cam\npaign, will help strengthen the international leadership role of the School of\n\nSoccer Team Heads To NCAA Playoffs\n\nFor the seventh straight year, the RIT men's soccer team will compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III soccer playoffs. Seeded first in the New York State region, RIT hosts number four, State University of New York (SUNY) at Binghamton, at 1 p.m., Sunday, Nov. 6. The other first round regional contest pits number three, Alfred University at number two, Clarkson University, at 2 p.m., Saturday, Nov. 5. Date and site for the regional championship will be determined after the first matches.\ncontinued on page 2\n\nPrinting Management and Sciences by increasing student scholarships, endowed faculty chairs, and state-of-the-art facilities.\nRonald A. White served as campaign chairman until September, when he was named interim director of RIT's Center for Newspaper Operations. Downie has been co-chairman of the campaign's Industry Executive Steering Committee since September 1987.\nPresident M. Richard Rose has stated that \"the capital campaign will help keep RIT on the cutting edge of emerging technologies. Our progress in shaping the way students learn about the graphic arts will influence the industry for\n\ngenerations.\"\n\nThe graphic arts capital campaign, which will focus on industry support, will provide $\\$ 10$ million for endowed professorships; \\$8 million for scholarships in printing, newspaper production, and magazine publishing; $\\$ 10$ million for equipment; and $\\$ 2$ million for library funds to support new programs. Research activities and joint programs with industry are also expected to increase as a result of the campaign.\n\nDownie, with more than 40 years of experience in the graphic arts industry, was vice president and general manager of Moore Business Form Research Center, Grand Island, N.Y., and vice president and general manager of the Kidder Press Company in Dover, N.H. He was senior vice president of corporate development of Moore Corporation in Toronto and was the founder and first president of International Imaging Material Inc., Amherst, N.Y.\n\nAwarded patents for printing, converting, and graphic arts equipment and processes, Downie was elected a member of the Society of Fellows of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation in 1971 in recognition of his contributions to the graphic arts.\n\n\nFAMILYTIES...RIT's seventh annual Parents Weekend brought students and their parents together Oct. 21-23.

Com plaints about parking have been numerous - and some are directed to Meredith, so he has made the rounds, explaining policies and problems to both student and staff groups.\n\"There are no secrets in parking. People can see what's going on,\" he said. \"Everyone can point to me and say, 'he's the one,' but I just explain the situation and they can see no one person is to blame.\"\n\nSuch a conciliatory attitude is appropriate for a police officer, which is what Meredith originally planned, even attending the City of Rochester Police Academy. Instead, he decided to work more directly in crime prevention and with youth and joined RIT.\n\"A lot of the skills required on my job are the same as those required of a police officer: confidence in your ability and communication skills,\" Meredith said.\n\nCo-op's Beverly Gburski Honored by Girl Scouts\n\nBeverly Gburski, director of RIT's Office of Cooperative Education and Placement, has been awarded the 1988 Girl Scout Salute to Excellence Award. The awards recognize current or former members of the Girl Scouts who have distinguished themselves through career achievement or volunteer service.\nGburski has been involved with the Girl Scout organization for more than 20 years, both as a troop member and as a Brownie and Junior Girl Scout leader. \"This award is special to me because scouting was one of the most positive influences on my life,\" said Gburski. \"Because of the Girl Scouts, I was able to travel, develop my leadership and communications skills, and meet women who became role models for me.\n'The co-op experience gives many RIT students the same opportunities that Girl Scouting offered me,' Gburski noted \"They're able to get a 'window on the world' and learn things they may not have been able to otherwise.\nDirector of RIT's co-op program for more than four years, Gburski oversees staff of 30 . Her leadership has been vital to the growth of the program, which now serves more than 3,000 students and is the fifth largest in the world\nEarlier this year, Gburski was named chairperson of the Cooperative Education Division of the American Society for En gineering Education.

According to a survey conducted Oct. 17-21 by RIT's Statistics Club, Vice President Bush is favored over Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, 53 to 47 per cent. Results were released Oct. 27 Other results include:\n57 percent of the students claim they are likely to vote Nov. 8\n- By a margin of 51 to 26 percent, with 23 percent undecided, RIT students think the Republican Party will do a better job of keeping the country prosperous. By a margin of 36 to 31 percent, with 33 percent undecided, RIT students think the Republican Party is more likely to keep the United States out of World War III.\n\nBy a margin of 66 to 7 percent, with 27 percent undecided, RIT students think the Democratic Party cares more for the less fortunate.\n39 percent say they are Republicans, 38 percent are Independents, and 23 percent are Democrats\n- 40 percent of the RIT students say they are middle-of-the-road, 32 percent call themselves liberal, and 28 percent are conservative.\nAccording to Dr. James Halavin of the Department of Mathematics and advisor to RIT's Statistics Club, \"Results are based on 254 responses out of 804 survey questionnaires mailed out to full-time students in all of RIT's full-time colleges.\"\nHe adds, \"The sampling tolerance for findings based on the total sample is plus or minus nine percentage points.\"\n\nSoccer Team...\n\nPlaying in the NCAAs is becoming old hat for Coach Doug May's Tigers. RIT received an automatic berth in the nationals by virtue of winning an unprecedented sixth straight Independent College Athletic Conference (ICAC) championship. Three of the four regional selections represent the ICAC (RIT, Clarkson, Alfred). The Tigers were $5-0-1$ in the conference and 13-0-1 overall.

The bag of sand, or \"granulated inertia\" as Winton calls it, on his chest absorbs the force, or kinetic energy, of the sledgehammer so hat he isn't hurt\n\nHe Nails Home the Point\n\nLying on a bed of nails while someone swings a sledgehammer at the cement block balanced on his head doesn't faze Doug Winton. Nor does driving a nail through a board with his hand, karate chopping a stack of wood, or cracking a board over his forehead. Though his audience shudders, Winton knows he's protected by the laws of physics.\n'The Amazing Winton\" performed these and other bizarre feats for his CCE physics class on October 22 in an eye-popping demonstration to explain such scientific principles as kinetic energy, inertia, and velocity.\n\"I've had students who couldn't stand to look,'\" says Winton, who's taught science to adult, part-time students at RIT for 15 years. Indeed, many that day held their breath, covered their eyes and expressed relief as he completed each stunt without injury.

The dinner and induction ceremonies will follow a reception at 6:30.\nSelected for induction are former fencer Ron Bambas (Printing, 1961), the late football player Paul Isbell (Printing, 1974), swimmer/softball player Debbie Dourlain Callegari (Printing, 1983), and wrestler Darrell Leslie (Food Administration, Darrell\n1983).\nBambas, president of Rainbow Graphics in Yorba Linda, Calif., was RIT's first All-American in any sport. He compiled a 103-38 record and placed sixth in the 1959-60 NCAAs. Isbell, who died in a boating mishap in 1976, was a premier defenseman. He made 319 tackles in three seasons, including a phenomenal 28 against St. Lawrence in 1974. He was a three-time Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) weekly all-star.\nIn two seasons of swimming Callegar earned 10 All-American honors and six New York State titles and scored 791 caree points. In softball, she played first base and hit .350. Leslie, a four-time AllAmerican, wrestled his way to a national title in 1983. During his career he won 108 matches and lost only 15 . He was named 1983 Senior Male Athlete of the Year.

The faculty has challenged its sophomore students to compete for a $\\$ 5,000$ scholarship, which will be applied toward the winner's senior tuition Students who choose to enter the 15 -month competition, which began last month for the Class of 1991, will present papers aimed at the graphic arts industry and its aimed at the graphic arts industry\nincreasing management demands.\n'\"The competition will underscore ou commitment to management education by preparing our students for an industry that demands professional leadership,\" said Miles Southworth, director of the school.\n\nComputer Creates Hybrid Art Style\n\nImagine an image created by Leonardo Da Vinci and Andy Warhol...Albrecht Dure and Ansel Adams...
