        "text": "Affidavit Notes\n\n\nVicente was in a holding cell at Area 5 after being arrested for 3 armed robberies and a simple robbery in the spring of 1993. He was bigh on heroin at the time, though \"not the way a heroin addict would wanna be.\" Vicente was a member of the Imperial Gangsters street gang (affiliate of the Folks). Several cells away from him was Bouto, a member of the Puerto Rican Stones street gang (affiliate of the People). Between Vicente and Bouto were 2 black men in cells, but Vicente doesn't remember their names.\n\n> **According to Edwin Maldonado's testimony, Maldonado may have been one of these men. Maldonado, however, is not black. In Maldonado's statement, he claimed that his was the only cell in between Bouto and Vicente, so we have to be careful here.\n\nVicente and Bouto were shouting to one another, killing time. \"He got some weed, we chillin'.\" He asked Bouto \"What do they got you for?\" Bouto replied \"Man, they tryin' to get me for this murder.\" He said that the police were trying to question him about it, but he at no point admitted to the crime. According to Vicente, the friendly conversation lasted several hours. \"We was kickin' it, we was talkin' shit.\"\n\n\"When you're in a holding cell,\" Vicente said, \"there's a turn-key (guard) standin' up above.\" \"They keep a camera on you to monitor you. If you call, they'll turn on an intercom. They wanted Bouto so bad.\"\n\nThe turn-kcy pulled Vicente from his cell and took him to an interrogation room where he met with Guevara and Halvorsen. Halvorsen offered to buy him candy bars and a pop, and he accepted. They bought him \"a couplea Snickers bars.\" Sugar helps heroin addicts on their comedown from the drug. They asked him what he and Bouto had been talking about. They also asked if Vicente knew what gang Bouto was in, playing on the fact that Bouto's gang rivaled Vicente's. According to Vicente, Guevara said \"We want you to do something for us.\"\n\n\"They wanted me to go down and get Bouto to talk to me as long as I could. Bouto was held back for a day or two so we could stay together.\" Bouto was held back al Grand and Central Station instead of taking a bas that day Cook County, Vicente said\n\n\"We can make in hard for you, or easy for you.\" they said. Vicente noted that while Guevara was playing tough, Halvorsen was playing the good cop role, assuring him that everything was going to be all right, etc.\n\n\"This is what we want you to say,\" they told him. \"Talk to him, carry out a little friendship. Say that he shot somebody at a high school, which was Roosevelt high school.\" Guevara and Halverson did not give Vicente the victim's name, because he didn't need it. A state's attorney was coming, and Vicente was supposed to tell him/her that the state agent (Bouto) shot somebody behind Roosevelt High School.\n\n\"I said, 'What the fuck? Hell no!' Your first law [as a gang member] is silence and secrecy. You are not to tell on anybody... not on your own, not any other criminal.\" When Vicente refused, the detectives again reminded him of the gang rivalries between",

He offered to put Vicente into the Witness Protection Program in Cook County Jail. Vicente again refused, and then Guevara \"hit me upside the head a few good times.\" Vicente said that Guevara hit him on the back of the head with his hand, where the injuries would not be visible.\n\nGuevara and Halvorsen left the room and spoke with one another outside of the room. Guevara returned to the room and hit Vicente again on the back of the head, this time with a \"skinny phone book\" that he had carried rolled up in his pocket. Guevara spoke to him in Spanish. He called Vicente a \"stupid son of a bitch\" and ordered him to \"Fuckin' help me.\" Halvorsen remained outside of the room.\n\n\"Everybody [in the office] knew what was happening in that room,\" said Vicente. After 2 hours, Vicente gave in. Guevara and Halvorsen sent Vicente back to his holding ceil.\n\n\"You're not gonna tell anybody what was happening in that room,\" they told him. They told him that they weren't going to make any promises to him, but that they would put him in the Witness Protection Program (WPP), that he wouldn't have to be in population, he would go to the \" $Q$.\" They said that they promised they could help him, although they couldn't promise how, but that they would make sure he got the minimum sentence and not the maximum. Vitente said the promises were made in very general terms and that since he had never been arrested before or been through the system he did not understand how things worked.\n\n(In the WPP, Vicente says he had steaks, pizzas, 2 visits every day, street clothes, jewelry. \"The state's attorney buys you clothes from petty cash.\" He was allowed 2 free phone calls per day. He didn't like it, though, because it was located in Division 1 in the basement, where there were rats and the building was falling apart.)\n\nThe Assistant State's Attorney came in to see Vicente at Grand and Central. Vicente said she was a \"rookie,\" new at her job, and didn't question the fishy behavior. \"She showed me her credentials. She wrote everything out. Guevara and Halvorsen were there. I told her that Boutó told me that he shot somebody outside the high school, Roosevelt High School.\"\n\n**Note – Vicente ALWAYS stated these two facts separately. Boutó shot someone outside a high school; which was Roosevelt High School.\n\n\"I was told to tell Boutó that they put me in some more lineups,\" Vicente said, when asked how he explained his absences to Boutó. Vicente said that Guevara told him that \"If you tell anyone [the truth], they'll start calling you a rat, a snitch. You'll get fucked up.\"\n\n\"Everytime I reviewed my statement, it got better and better and better.\"\n\nThree days later, Vicente was moved to a different building. He was moved to Division 10, where he was put in a gallery. It was general population. He was finally",

He said that he knew that the separation occurred because Bouto would eventually find out what had happened, and they didn't want him and Vicente on the same gallery.\n\n**Note: This move was potentially the bus ride during which Vicente confessed the snitching to Lydell Williams. We showed Vicente the photograph of Williams, but he didn't recognize the face.\n\n\"I'm in 3B or 3D Gallery. After one week, I get a pass. In's a printout saying where you're going.\" The pass says Vicente is going to court,\" but he knows that because he doesn't have a court date yet, he will actually be taken to the State's Attorney's office. \"I tell everybody I'm going to court.\" The investigators bring him to the office\n\nVicente waited in the bullpen from Sam until 11:30 am.\nHe was taken up.in an elevator quietly and handed to the Cook County State's Attorney's office investigators. They put him in a freight elevator and walked him around the courtrooms and through the metal detectors to the State's Attorney's office. He was in handcuffs. \"l saw pictures and mug shots of inmates.\" Eventually, Halvorsen and Guevara came in and started talking to Vicente \"nicely.\" They uncuffed him. Vicente met John Dillon and Matt Coughlan.\n\n\"Guevara told me, 'You're an IG. This is what we want you to know.\" They started talking to him, and showing him crime scene photos from the murder of Rodrigo Vargas. \"They already knew who they wanted for the murder.\"\n\n'They said that somebody was killed in a van. A stickup murder. The body was at the scene. It was all shot up. It was a hooked up, customized Chevy van.\"\n\nGuevara told Vicente that \"This is my way of telling you that the word on the street has it that\" Pistol Pete, Armando and Jordan committed the crime.\n\nGuevara continued \"We want you to say that you were there, you were driving the car, you saw it.\" Vicente wouldn't do it even though the detectives told him that they would say he had no knowledge of the intent to murder Vargas.\n\"We're here to talk to you about this, and to move you to a special place,\" the detectives told him. Vicente said that he was forced to go to the $Q$ because of his safety. He was disappointed because his current cellmate had been getting heroin from a guard. His name was \"Buzz,\" and he was a Spanish Lord, charged with the intentional murder of a policeman.\n\"The judge gave me an I-bond, a \\$ 50,000 I-bond. I was told to tell my cellmate I was leaving, not that I was testifying, and he would pack my stuff.\"\n\nVicente said that he and Guevara argued in a separate room. Vicente told Guevara that he wasn't going to do it, and they reached a compromise. The conversation lasted for about three hours. \"How bout if you say that after the murder, they told you",

        "text": "and they gave you the gun...\" again, Vicente refused. He refused any story that placed him the scene of the crime, or gave him anything to do with the crime or the followup.\n\n\"Okay, you were standing on a comer of Harding and Altgeld (Vicente lived there and Halvorsen knew that), you guys ended up on the porch and you were talking.\" The three accused told Vicente that they had been driving down the street when they saw some guy that they stuck up for some chain, which they sold to a jewelry store. They saw some victim at a gas station, they saw the cash in his hand. \"We had $\\$ 2$ for gas, we needed money for gas to go to the dope spot,\" the accused cold Vicente. After they saw Vargas at the gas station and saw the money in his hand, \"We were following the car and the wife started looking; we're young guys, we followed the car to where they lived, and we watched them. We waited until 5 am...\"\n\nAccording to the story, the trio got Vicente into their car at the corner of Hamlin and Altgeld. They put the gun in the vent, and Vicente and one of the guys started arguing. \"Mondo fucked up,\" they said, and they would never have had to kill Vargas if Mondo wouldn't have fucked up. The four ended up on Vicente's mother's porch.\n\n\"Coughlan and Dillon knew what was happening behind closed doors. They were sitting there listening. When Guevara was brainstorming, Guevara said \"We've already got you on this case [Bouto], you might as well go all the way. Everyone's gonna know what you did, you'll be a snitch.\" Vicente said that he was on drugs again. Halvorsen assured him that \"We're gonna make sure that you don't get charged, (with the murder of Vargas) you don't get sentenced, everything will be all right.\"\n\nTwo State's Attorney's were sitting with Vicente at the time, writing down the statement with Halvorsen and Guevara coaching him. They would prompt him with \"Didn't you say...\" \"Didn't he say...\" etc. They coached because they hadn't given Vicente time to memorize the story. \"I wanted to get back to the bullpen,\" Vicente said, \"so I could get fucked up.\"\n\nWhile in the State's Attorney's office someone showed Vicente an Imperial Gangsters tattoo in a photograph and asked him to identify the significance of the symbol. They wanted him to get up on the stand. \"I gave them what they wanted...the gangster crown, the letters, and the name under the tattoo began with an 'M'. They didn't tell me the victim's name or where he lived. They fabricated the whole story.\" Note: This was an unrelated story. The ASA's wanted Vicente to testify as a sort of gang expert in a case that was totally unrelated to any of the three he testified in. It was not clear if it even was Dillon or Coughlin asking him to identify the significance of the symbol.\n\nThe state's attorney's never talked to Guevara or Halvorsen about the coaching in front of Vicente.",

They came up with the theory of Iglesias and they said that me and Iglesias would be in the same bullpen, where we would carry out a conversation. I'd never met Iglesias. Never seen him, never ran into him. Guevara showed me a picture of 'Snake' (Iglesias). He had sliced-up eyebrows, which are dense.\n\nI would say that Iglesias told me that he intended to shoot her in the head.\" Here, we had some discrepancies in our notes: we think he said that he was supposed to say when he was on his way to court and in the bull pen, Iglesias told him. Vicente also mentioned Canton, IL around the same time, but we think that that was in relation to a later date, after he had already testified.\n\nQ: What did Guevara and Halvorsen do for you in return?\n\n\"They fucked me (figuratively).\" I got six years for the armed robberies and 3 years for the simple robberies. The six should've eaten the 3 while I'm doin' it. When they seen what happened with Pacheco, Coughlan was furious. For six weeks they were calling me over, coaching me. My ex wife would come over, no patting her down, I was uncuffed. She would bring drugs. I would stash it. Guevara and Halvorsen as well as the ASA's would order Vicente chicken, burritos, other food. Guevara would give him money when he asked for it. He used the money on cigarettes or gave it to his wife when she visited. \"The total - I got him for at least two or three hundred dollars in cash. He knew I was buying tobacco.\"\n\nVicente didn't go into too much detail, but he did make it clear that he was allowed conjugal visits with both his ex-wife and with Michele. Gia Grace, his daughter, is living proof of these special favors - he admits that his daughter's middle name was chosen to represent the grace by which he was able to \"propagate his seed,\" etc. etc. Her first name, Gia, was the name of a very beautiful supermodel who died of a drug overdose.\n\nAfter the (Serrano?) trial, Guevara and Halvorsen gave Vicente 2 soldier bottles of J\\&B, which he drank. He then passed out.\n\nVicente was allowed Polaroid photos with his wife and her kids. \"Most of my jewelry and most of my clothes, John Dillon and Matt Coughlan bought for me. Every time I went to the State's Attorney's office, they [Guevara and Halvorsen] were there. The deal was that the six years ate up the 3 years, but the lawyer argued about it with John Dillon about me getting six years.\"\n\n\"They were not happy with my performance in Montanez or Iglesias. I wasn't happy where I was at, there was no schooling at the WPP. Many times I thought about backing out. I would yell at Coughlan and they would call Guevara. I chased this guy with a stick and beat this black guy in the Q so I could get out of there. They gave me an I-Bond, they moved me to DuPage. I started a fight. They sent me back to Cook County Jail but put me in a Protective Custody gallery.",

I had clothes, jewelry, and money sent to me to send home. The day it was over was the day they had used me for all their cases and they had me in Big Muddy River in SMU. Sometimes I'd get a call from John Dillon, he'd ask if I was all right.\"\n\nVicente received $1200 plus $400 or $500 moving expenses through the Relocation Program. He named a State's Attorney representative, Luz, who took his fingerprint and thumbprint and a Polaroid photo for the program. She called him and he reported to pick up his check.\n\n\"I had to go two times, or one time every week,\" to talk with the ASA's about the cases\n\n\"I called my ex wife and I told her it's done. I had known her prior to coming to prison. I couldn't tell ANYONE that I was lying. Half the time I would tell them what I wanted to tell them, half the time I was told 'You need to say this, you need to memorize this.'\"\n\nHalvorsen and Guevara didn't know I was friends with Pete. They didn't know about Armando and the fight, didn't know about the muffler. I wasn't trying to volunteer anything. I knew who Jordan was because Jordan's a pretty popular guy. I grew up with him. I knew his brothers, Angel and Derek, his sister. His father's always in jail.\n\nThere was a little Pistol Pee from Fullerton and Kenmore. There was one from North and Hamlin (Montanez). Halvorsen tried to figure out which one was Montanez, and that's when we went through. Halvorsen knew it was the big one.\n\nThere is paperwork signed from John Dillon. The state's attorney wrote up that I went to Officer Halvorsen and Guevara at Grand and Central. This was to try and make it look like Vicente had volunteered the information, Vicente said. When they coached me, Guevara and Halvorsen were both there. Halvorsen was brainstorming the stories along with Guevara. Guevara is the leading man. He tells Halvorsen what to do. The two detectives poked Vicente in the head while they coached him.\n\nDonna Kowalski (mentioned here, but not explained in my notes)\n\nA few times, Michele asked me about all this, but I told her not to ask.
