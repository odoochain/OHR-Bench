This abusive use of government power further erodes our protections guaranteed by the Constitution.\"\n\nThe news release said that ACE is seeking additional plaintiffs and financial contributions to support the action. Support is sought from individuals and organizations, state and local governments and others. Information is available from ACE, c/o Federal Lands Legal Foundation, P.O.
