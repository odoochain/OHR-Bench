        "text": "Acclaim! for Kallir\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1949\n\nThe New York Times\n\nWinner of Brooklyn Institute 1949 Award Proves Ability as Pianist at Town Hall\n\nBY NOEL STRAUS\n\nRemarkable gifts as musician and technician were made known by Lilian Kallir, 17-year-old pianist, who gave her first New York recital yesterday afternoon at Town Hall. Looking even younger than her age, and blessed with a disarmingly large presence, Miss Kallir captivated her large audience with a series of performances so poised and controlled, so replete with insight and imagination, that she already proved well on the way toward an important career.\n\nBorn in Prague, of Austrian parents, Miss Kallir, who arrived in this country two years ago and is now an American citizen, won the 1949 American Artists Award of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. Her playing yesterday was completely self-effacing, sane and wholesome. It was, moreover, unusually sensitive, poetic and comprehending. Miss Kallir knew how to shape a phrase, give her interpretations clear architecture, design, and apply color in masterly fashion.\n\nProbed Deeply Into Style\n\nEven more to her credit was her ability to probe deeply into the meaning and style of her varied offerings and project the message of the music across the footlights with the full measure of temperament and inborn feeling such artistry entails.\n\nNEW YORK Herald Tribune\n\nLilian Kallir\n\nPianist, 17, Makes Her Debut at Town Hall\n\nBy Arthur Berger\n\nLilian Kallir, seventeen-year-old pianist, stirred a large audience to very enthusiastic applause at her New York debut recital yesterday afternoon in Town Hall. Miss Kallir's listeners were prepared in advance for someone of more than ordinary talents, for, as winner of the 1949 American Artists Award, she has the distinction of being included on this season's major series of the Brooklyn Academy of Music with top-flight artists. The confidence, efficiency, fleetness of fingers, and technical facility with which she dispatched her debut program yesterday afternoon were such that one could easily see how Miss Kallir would impress a board of expert judges. This was obviously prize-winning playing—playing unperturbed by the indecisions and inhibitions of older pianists when self-consciousness sets in.\n\nNew York Journal-American\n\nLilian Kallir gave promise of great things in her Town Hall debut on Saturday. At 17 she disclosed an artistry quite exceptional for a teen-age pianist.\n\nHer imaginative insight and her power to communicate feeling gave her performance an air of distinction. She made it evident that she is worth hearing now.\n\n...And the Brooklyn Eagle adds!\n\n``...she plays with the maturity of an artist twice her age. She has technique to spare, with the result that she never has to be conscious of what her fingers are doing and can concentrate on problems of interpretation. Her tone is full and man-sized, and everything she is poised, showing real insight and penetrating musicianship.''\n\nEXCLUSIVE MANAGEMENT IN THE SOUTH\n\nAlkahest Celebrity Bureau\n\nRUSSELL BRIDGES, President\n\n1222 Peachtree St., N.E. \\hfill Atlanta, Georgia\n\nGUE \\hfill D.
