Two New York-based antibias groups are planning protests against him this week, and the Village Voice has published details of what it calls a \"racist\" letter Wahlberg wrote as a result of the 1988 beating of Tranh Lam, a Vietnamese man in Dorchester.\n\nWahlberg, 21, who is the brother of Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block, grew up with nine siblings on Perewell Street in Dorchester. As a rapper, he is known as Marky Mark. \"Good Times,\" Wahlberg said that the April 1988 beating of Tranh Lam, with a 5-foot stick and a baseball bat, was racially motivated beating of a Vietnamese man in Dorchester.\n\nMARKY MARK, Page 16\n\n\n\n### Lawmakers, Flynn vow rescue try of new Garden\n\nBy Peter J. Howe  \nGLOBE STAFF\n\nMayor Raymond Flynn and Beacon Hill leaders pledged yesterday to rescue the $160 million new Boston Garden project, which was canceled last week. In an emergency effort to find another Boston site for a new hockey-basketball arena.\n\nEmerging from an hourlong meeting at Flynn's office in Parkman House, the mayor, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti, and other city and state leaders all said they want to find a way to revive the arena project.\n\nHowever, the city and state representatives declined to address Flynn's meeting with the president of the New Boston Garden Company, the arena's developers would \"look at\" revising the project. The legislators substantially rewrote the title- chapter 93 law that was approved Thursday, which prompted Garden developers to cancel the project.\n\nThe mayor said, \"we are not going to give up. We are still negotiating a new bill.\" We are out of the project.\n\nJEREMY M. JACOBS, chairman and chief executive of Delaware North, which had announced the project last Thursday he was abandoning the project after eight years of planning.\n\nBOSTON GARDEN, Page 1\n\n### In the end, each side saw other as greedy\n\nBy John Powers  \nGLOBE STAFF\n\nDid the Boston Garden deal fall apart because some Delaware North asked the state for \"corporate welfare?\" Or because lawmakers instead focused on killing a bill that would have caused neither side was comfortable with a delicate public-private partnership?\n\n\"That's not down to the ele- ment of mutual confidence,\" Gardens president Lawrence J. Jacobs said yesterday, after Delaware North had refused to \"play poker\" with the Legislature over the same project. \"That's what business is all about. If you don't have that, you don't have a deal.\"\n\nIn the end, each side felt that the other was being greedy.\n\nThe House and Senate be- lieved that Gardens president JEREMY JACOBS was getting a sweetheart deal from the Weld administration at the expense of the public and still wanted more. \"I get the impression that they were trying to take advantage of us,\" said one senator.\n\nANALYSIS, Page 11\n\n### More on Garden\n\n- The Garden project was a test of Massachusetts' business climate, leaders said yesterday.

Individually, Boston University has received $66.6 million and $48.1 million, respectively, in earmarked funds, placing the 10th and 11th among 100 universities surveyed by the Con- gressional Research Service.\n\n\"Money that is divvied up by Con- gress to earmark comes out of the hide of other programs - publicly debated, peer-reviewed, carefully scrutinized programs,\" said Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. \"It's a perversion of the whole federal funding science programs.\"\n\nEarmarking refers to a tactic in which congressmen add a piece of legislation that provides federal money to a specific institution. The practice is a briefing yesterday at the American Association for the Advancement of Sci- ence meeting in Boston. The funds obtained by Tufts University and the University of New Hamp- shire, along with all other universi- ties nationwide that obtained a total of $225 million through earmarking in 1992.\n\nFUNDS, Page 16\n\n### FLOPPY RISKS\n\nSaturday: AM miniseries, 10  \nSunday: Monday, Tuesday, 35  \nHigh tide: 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM  \nFull report: Page 24\n\n### FEATURES CLASSIFIED\n\nAsk The Globe 28  \nClassified 17-22  \nCars 26-27  \nComics 26-27  \nHelp Wanted 28  \nHomes 28-29  \nHoroscopes 20  \nComics/TV 18  \nDeath notices 28-29  \nReal Estate 48  \nEntertainment 21  \nSports 22  \nLottery 22  \nYardsticks 24  \nMarriage/Region 21  \nLearning 28  \nTV/Radio 20",
