        "text": "ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORT \\\\ January to June 2015\n\nThe Games and Amusements Board (GAB), an agency attached to the Office of the President, is vested with supervisory and regulatory authority over professional sports and games in the Philippines. The major final outputs (MFOs) of GAB in the regulation and supervision of professional sports and games are as follows:\n\nI. BOXING AND OTHER CONTACT SPORTS\n\nFor Professional Boxing and Other Contact Sports Division, the actual number of license applications from professional sports practitioners for period January to June 2015 was lower by $3.80 \\%$ at 999 compared to last year's 1,037. Likewise, permit applications was lower by $6.58 \\%$ at 76 compared to 81 of last year, which resulted to lower number of games monitored and supervised, which posted a $22.05 \\%$ decrease at 440 than last year's 537 . The decline was a result of lower number of permits applied by the promoters as well as the number of bouts per event.\n\nLast June 11-13, 2015, the GAB hosted the 2015 Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation (OPBF) General Assembly at L'Fisher Hotel in Bacolod City. The event is yet another milestone in the history of the Philippines and the Games and Amusements Board (GAB) as we once again are placed at the helm of managing the affairs of the OPBF, after 14 years. The 2015 OPBF General Assembly was participated by boxing experts and practitioners from other member countries across Asia and the Pacific, united by a common goal - the continued development of the sport of professional boxing.\n\nII. PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL GAMES\n\nFor Professional Basketball and Other Professional Games Division, actual number of license applications from professional sports practitioners was lower by $4.12 \\%$ at 995 compared to last year's 1,036. There was however, an increase in the actual number of permits issued by $30.53 \\%$ at 262 compared to last year's 182. The increase in permits issued was due to the increase in golf events as well as the reformatting of games by the PBA, which likewise resulted in the increase of the actual number of games supervised and monitored, by $10.50 \\%$ at 2,714 compared to last year's 2,429 .\n\n\nTel.

        "text": "All licenses and permit applications were acted upon within two days upon receipt of applications. Likewise, there were no reported violations in the licensing/registration and in the actual conduct of professional sports and games for periods January to June 2015, due to effective supervision and regulation of the GAB Professional Basketball and Other Professional Games Division.\n\nIII. BETTING ASPECT OF HORSE RACING\n\nFor Horse Racing Betting Supervision Division, actual number of license applications from professional sports practitioners was lower at 701 (by $1 \\%$ ) compared to last year's 710 for periods January to June 2015. However, actual number of permit applications for the holding of events at 787 and the number of betting/events supervised and monitored at 12,477 were higher than last year's 784 (by $0.38 \\%$ ) and 11,658 (by $6.56 \\%$ ), respectively. All licenses and permit applications were acted upon within 2 days upon receipt of applications. There were no reported violations or any untoward incident during monitoring of all off-track betting stations (OTBs).\n\nIV. PELOTA GAMES (JAI-ALAI)\n\nFor the $1^{\\text {st }}$ semester of 2015, the actual number of licenses and permits issued are higher by $5.41 \\%$ (at 37 compared to 35 of last year) and $1.66 \\%$ (at 181 compared to 178 of last year), respectively.\n\nV. ANTI-ILLEGAL GAMBLING UNIT\n\nUp to this date, no PNP personnel are detailed to the GAB Anti-Illegal Gambling Unit (AIGU), despite continuous follow-ups of our request to PNP. Without the PNP detailed personnel, no enforcement actions can be done and hence no performance specifically in the category of number of persons arrested and cases filed and prosecuted.\n\nHowever, the organic personnel of GAB-AIGU still continue to appear and testify before courts where pending criminal cases are being heard. For this reason, our accomplishment focused mainly on the number of court hearings attended. For the $1^{\\text {st }}$ semester of 2015, there was only 17 actual number of court hearings attended compared to last year's 73 for the same period. The activity in this area is based on the scheduling of the court.\n\nFurther, any illegal gambling activity reported to GAB is being endorsed to either NBI or PNP, for proper action.",
