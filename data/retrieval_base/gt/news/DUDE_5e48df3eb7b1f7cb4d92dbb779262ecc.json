        "text": "Concerved by Michigan inventor Ephriam Shay, the Shay Engine was designed for the roughest mountain duty under the worst possible conditions. In the absence of streams to float logs to the mill, loggers had to haul incredibly heavy loads out of the mountains by rail-on steep grades, sharp curves and hastily laid roadbeds where power rather than speed was important. Lumbermen instantly recognized the Shays as the answer to their prob lems and bought them by the hundreds.\n\nUnLIKE standard steam engines, every wheel of the Shay engine and tender is a drive wheel-no wheel can spin unless they all spin-giving the Shays tremendous traction. Vertical cylinders and the crankshaft make multiple power strokes per revolution of the gear driven wheels for a smooth, even flow of power to negotiate steep grades with heavy loads effortlessly.\n\nOf THE 2,761 Shays built by the Lima (Ohio) Locomotive Works beginning in 1880, the four at Cass are among the few remaining anywhere, as priceless and almost unique relics of those old lumbering days.\n\n\nRare Heisler locomotive is now in use\n\n1968 C.

        "text": "Histaric. Atuthentic. At ride into yesterday\n\nA RIDE on the Cass Scenic Railroad is a new and thrilling experience for youngsters who may never have seen a steam locomotive. It appeals even more to older generations who grew up in the bygone Steam Engine Era. Both are filled with a sense of excitement and anticipation as they approach the old Cass Depot to get tickets from the Agent for this once-in-a-lifetime adventure.\n\nEarly comers will be interested to watch and photograph the hundred-year-old ritual as engineer and brakemen oil, \"wipe\" and ready the equipment while the fireman checks the water tender or shovels more coal into the boiler's roaring inferno, orange flames leaping at his feet.\nBillowing clouds of black, sulfurous smelling coal smoke nip the nostrils. The ear ringing hiss of white steam announces the train's imminent departure, to be pushed from behind as in the olden days by authentic, restored antique Shay engines.\nResounding blasts from the melodious old-time steam whistle echo through the valleys warning laggards to hurry and passengers to take their seats. The conductor drawls a traditional \"Aaaaall Aboarrrrd\"! With a clang, Clang, CLANG of the bell and CHUG Chug, chug of pistons, the train lurches forward to begin a memorable, spine tingling ride.\nSTEEL wheels clickety-click in increasing tempo as the train picks up speed on the same standard gauge rails over which more than ONE BILLION board feet of lumber and an equal volume of pulpwood were shipped during the early part of the century, testimony to the vastness and incalculable wealth of this once virgin timber stand.\nFun For The Family\n\nFrom the open observation coaches, passengers may drink in the unfolding panorama of remote and beautiful West Virginia scenery, or catch an occasional glimpse of wildlife scurrying away from the huffing, puffing iron monsters.\nPowerful engines easily push the cars up grades averaging four to five per cent, and at times an astonishing $12 \\%$. Two of the few remaining switchbacks anywhere in the US afford added excitement on the road, one of the highest non-cog railroads east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\nWHITTAKER STATION-The shorter ride of four miles to Whittaker Station takes two hours for the eight-mile round trip. Passing the water tower and machine shop, the railroad begins to climb lower slopes of Cheat Mountain along picturesque Leatherbark Creek. The train then zigzags through two switchbacks, the engines alternately pushing then pulling passenger cars because the grade is so steep.\nAfter passing the entrance to Cass Cave, the railroad levels off for the stop at Whittaker Station, surrounded by green meadows and fine views of the countryside. There is a cool, shady picnic grove with tables where excursionists may rest and enjoy the scenery. The stop has drinking water and rest rooms.\n\n\nBALD KNOB-The long haul of 11 miles to Bald Knob takes about four and a half hours for the 22 -mile round trip. Panoramas of the lofty Appalachians become more beautiful as the train climbs higher and higher. Passengers suddenly realize they are entering a completely different world, mainly because of the change in trees, flowers and atmosphere. By climbing the 2,390 feet from Cass (2452-feet) to Bald Knob (4842-feet) on Back Allegheny Mountain and second highest point in West Virginia, passengers have made the equivalent to an 800 -mile trip to Canada in climate because of the higher altitude. Here are found spruce trees, snowshoe hares and other plants and animals typical in the far north.\nThe rustic overlook affords one of the most awesome, overwhelming spectacles in the east. Dwarfed by distance and almost lost in the vastness of the panorama are the giant 300 -foot radio telescope and airport landing strip of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank in the valley at the foot of the mountain. A remarkable contrast between the wilderness at Bald Knob and today's space-age facilities! A ride on the Cass Scenic Railroad is an unforgettable experience for the whole family.
