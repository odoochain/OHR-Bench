I told thee I had been with Counsellor Sampson, and that he seemed very willing to assist me in my inquiry, but was not then able to do it in such a manner as he would wish. I procured him a copy of a work some time ago published, by one of the inspectors of the prison; which he thinks is very full and satisfactory on the subjects of thy inquiries, and I am of the same opinion, as it contains a particular answer to all or most of all thy queries, by an intelligent man, who has written from his own experience. 1 have therefore procured che of the books, which-I now send; I much regret that I had no opportunity of sending it sooner. There are, I understand, some little alterations in the prison regulations, since this work was printed, which I have not yet been able to learn, but I understand they are trifling, and there are some alterations in the Jaws respecting the prisoners: none are sent to it now for petit larceny, nor I believe for assault and battery, consequently the number of prisoners is not as great as heretofore.\n\"I questioned the writer of this book on the different particulars óf thy queries, and his answers in general correspond with what he had already committed to print on these subjects. He thinks that reformation will never succeed among the prisoners, until there is a plan adopted so that each individual shall have a separate apartment at night, which is the time they have the opportunity of corrupting each other. At his suggestion on this subject, one state, he told me, had lately adopted his plan.\"\n\nOur correspondent likewise transmitted a letter from Counsellor Sampson, from which the following extracts are made:\n\n\"I ask your pardon for not soner answering your last note. I have been absorbed in business, and the responsible care of other men's affairs.\n\n\"I breakfasted at the State Prison, and saw what every body can see—prisoners at work, some weaving, some shoemaking, nailmaking, \\&c. I conversed with the inspectors one by one. As we were agreed before, that reformation of those who go there is hardly to be expected, so that opinion is confirmed, although there are a good many exceptions. There is a variety of opinions about the sufficiency of the establishment to pay its own expences. Colonel Tew, and some others, are of opinion, that if it were not for faults in the internal administration, it would amply suffice. Upon the whole, the institution may, I think, be safely and largely commended, and our friends and benevolent countrymen need not abate any thing of their virtuous zeal for its promotion in Ireland. There is no criminal so likely to commit an offence from momentary impulse, or impetuous feeling, from thoughtlessness or extravagance, as an Irish",

Wherever the crime is the result of accident, temptation, or circumstance, and is not the consequence of rooted baseness, there may be reform. But it is certain, that the laws and their administration in some countries, are calculated to make anv people bad. The result of many opinions seems to be, that though the State Prison does not in many instances reform, yet it cannot be said to injure society, and it saves the morals of the public from the example of cold and deliberate bloodshed, and promotes gentleness of heart, and tenderness of feeling.\n\"In looking to persons for the conduct and support of such an institution, care should be taken that it may not become a jub for electioneering, or other unworthy patronage. Temperance and suavity of manners in the conductors, best conduce to bestow that character of mild authority, that soothes the unruly passions, and insinuates itself into the heart insensibly. But a strict discipline, and hard coercion, would be requisite towards such numbers of desperate and refractory spirits as would become inmates.\"\n\nWith these preliminary hints from our much respected countryman, Counsellor Sampson, the goodness of whose heart, and the enlargement of whose views are not forgotten by many in Ireland, we proceed to give extracts from 'An Account of the State Prison or Penitentiary House in the City of New York; by one of the Inspectors of the Prison.\"\n\n\"A punishment to be just, should have only that degree of severity which is suf-\nficient to deter others - Perpetual labour will have this effect more than the punish-\nment of death.\" BECCARIA.\n\n# INTRODUCTION.\nThat branch of jurisprudence which treats of crimes and their punishment, is of the most interesting and momentous in the whole code of s. The peace, security and happiness of society depend on the wisdom and justice of the means devised for the prevention of crimes. In no nation have legislators bestowed that profound attention on this subject which its importance demands.\n\nWhile civilization and refinement were changing the condition and manners of social life, the criminal codes of the nations of Europe retained a vindictive and sanguinary spirit, the growth of a rude and barbarous age. Benevolent and virtuous men saw and deplored the evils produced and perpetuated by unequal and cruel punishments; but the mild voice of reason and humanity reached not the thrones of princes or the halls of legislators. While the State was aggrandized by conquest, enriched by commerce, or ornamented by the productions of art, they thought not of the unhappy beings who suffered under the numerous oppressions of tyrannical laws. While every object which encompassed them wore the aspect of splendour and felicity, their dazzled eyes were not turned to those gloomy abodes were the victims of injustice languished in misery and despair.\n\nThe art of printing, by which one man, however private and obscure, is enabled to make himself heard by a whole people, prepared the way for reformation. Montesquiteu exposed the errors of legislators, and unfolded sounder principles of jurisprudence. The eloquent Beccaria roused the attention of civilized Europe, and, by his unanswerable appeal to reason and humanity, produced those successive efforts to meliorate the system of penal laws, which constitute the",

Howard, the active and indefatigable friend of man, by exploring the prisons and dungeons of Europe, and, from their dark and unvisited recesses, bringing to light the enormous abuses and dreadful miseries produced by cruel laws and their corrupt administration, more powerfully awakened the feelings of humanity and justice, by which the legislator is enabled to complete the great work of correction.\n\nBut while the names of Montesquieu, Beccaria, and Howard, are repeated with gratitude and admiration, the legislators and philanthropists of our own country deserve not to be forgotten. The history of Pennsylvania presents to our view a man whu claims the praise of being the first to frame and propose a criminal code from which the punishment of death was excluded, except in the single case of premeditated murder, and by which each crime received a punishment equitably proportioned to the degree of its enormity.\n\nIn England, where secret accusations, secret and mock trials, torture, and all the cruel contrivances of superstition and despotism to confound and destroy alike the innocent. and the guilty, were unknown; where the excellent institution of a trial by jury, and humane and wise forms of legal proceedings were established for the protection of the accused; where liberty was defended by law, and cherished by the spirit and manners of the people; even in that enlightened country there existed a scale of punishments as sangumary and unjust as any in Europe. The criminal delivered to imprisonment was often forgotten by the laws, and suffered an aggravation of his chastisement in the loathsome horrors of his prison, and the extortions and oppression of his keepers.\n\nNo adequate distinction was made, in the distribution of punishments, between a poacher and a parricide, between him who filched a loaf to satisfy the cravings of hunger, and him who first robbed and then murdered his benefactor.* The colonies of England adopted in general the civil and criminal laws of the $p$ resent state In some, the spirit of freedom which animated the first adventurers, fugitives from civil and religious tyranny, produced changes, and the gradual formation of a milder and more equitable system of penal laws.\n\nWilliam Penn, $\\dagger$ actuated by the pure principles of a christian and a philosopher, listening to the simple suggestions of humanity and justice, constructed the equitable code just mentioned, which be boldly enacted and transmitted to England to receive the royal assent, although the charter for the establishment of his colony expressly enjoined the introduction of the English laws. Assent to the new system was refused by the king , yet it was continued in force by the colonial legislature for thirty-five years. Disputes took place between the crown and the governor of Pennsylvania, concerning the ordinance requiring the officers of the government to take an oath instead of an affirmation. This contest, which kept the colony in a ferment for many years, was at length terminated by the legislature, who\n\n\n* Blackstone's Commentaries, Vol. IV. passim, and page 18. \" It is a melancholy truth, that among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, no less than one hundred and :ixty have been declared, by act of parliament, to be felony without benefit of clergy; or, in other words, to be worthy of instant death.\" The number of capital punishments has been considerably augmented since the publication of the Commentaries.\n$\\dagger$ See Proud's History of Pennsylvania, Bradford's Enquiry, \\&c.",

In return for this concession, the crown yielded the right of affirmation to such as conscientiously refused to take an oath.\n\nThough restrained for a time, the spirit of reform revived with the revolution; and, strengthened by the discussions of the general principles of freedom, and the writings of Beccaria and others, at length produced that system of punishment for crimes, which reflect so much honour on that State. The new penal laws of Pennsylvania, its prisons and penitentiary house, their progress, internal economy, and management, have been already made known by several publications.\n\nWhen New-York became an English colony, the laws and institutions of England were introduced and continued in their full extent and rigour. This favourite child of the crown reflected more strongly than any other the image of its parent. Even after the revolution, when the spirit of liberty led to inquiries favourable to principles of moderation and justice, the criminal code of this State was distinguished for its severity. It was not to be expected, that a people enamoured of freedom and a republic, should long acquiesce in a system of laws, many of them the product of barbarous $u$ sages, corrupt society, and monarchical principles, and imperfectly adapted to a new country, simile manners, and a popular form of government.\n\nBefore giving an account of the changes that have been made in that system, it will be proper to exhibit, briefly the several punishments as they existed antecedent to the year 1796. By a law, which bears date February 1788, the following crimes are declared punishable with death: 1. Treason; 2. Misprision of treason; 3. Murder; 4. Rape; 5. Sodomy; 6. Burglary; 7. Feloniously taking goods and chattels out of any church or place of public worship; 8. Feloniously breaking any house, by day or by night, any person being in the house, and thereby put in fear; 9. Robbing any person in the dwelling-house or place of such person, the owner, dweller, his wife, children, or servants being in the same, or within the precincts thereof, sleeping or waking; 10. Robbing any person; 11. Feloniously taking away goods or chattels from a dwelling-house, the owner or any other person being therein, and put in fear; 12. Robbing any dwelling-house in the day-time, any person being therein; 13. Robbing any person or persons in or about the highway; 14. Arson, or the wilful burning any house or barn; 15. Malicious maiming and wounding another; 16. Forgery, or counterfeiting any record, charter, deed, writing, sealed will, testament, bond, bill of exchange, promissory note for the payment of money, indorsement or assignment thereof, acquittance or receipt for money or goods, any bill of credit or public securities issued by Congress or any of the United States, or any gold or silver coin current in the State. The conviction of all which felonies was accompanied with a forfeiture of the goods and chattels, lands, tenements, and hereditaments of the felon. All other felonies were for the first offence punishable by fine, imprisonment, or corporal punishment, or all or either of them at the discretion of the court. For the second offence the offender was to suffer death. These felonies consisted of various thefts not of the preceding description, amounting to Grand Larceny, that is, above the sum of five pounds.

He procured a number of copies of a report on the criminal code of Pennsylvania,* with an account of the penitentiary there, and transmitted them to two of the members of the legislature of New-York, then sitting in Albany, with a request that they might be distributed among the members, who, on their return home to their respective counties, might communicate them to the people, whose attention would thus be called to a similar reformation in their own laws. The same citizen, in 1795, made several visits to the prisons in Philadelphia, for the purpose of obtaining complete and satisfactory information of the operation and effects of the new system of punishment established, in which he received ample assistance from his worthy and intelligent friend Caleb Lownes.\n\nThe result of these inquiries was\n\n\n* By William Bradford, esq. one of the Judges of the supreme court of Pennsylvania.\n\ncommunicated by him to General Schuyler, a distinguished member of the senate of this State. This pub-lic-spirited senator, perceiving the great importance of the subject, and the wisdom of an experiment so loudly demanded by humanity, visited, in company with the same person, the Philadelphia penitentiary, and witnessed, with surprise and satisfaction, the spirit of wisdom and benevolence which presided in that institution; the cleanliness, decency, order, and tranquil industry which prevailed in every part. With minds deeply impressed with what they had seen and heard, they returned to the city of New-York, where the legislature were then convened. A few citizens, actuated by the same sentiments were consulted, and a plan of reform, in a bill \"for making alterations in the criminal laws of the State, and the erecting of state prisons,\" was prepared by General Schuyler, and in four days after his return, was presented to the senate. The bill was introduced by an able and animated speech of the mover; and after having being powerfully supported by several members,* was carried, with only one dissenting voice; and in the bouse of assembly with about nine opposing votes. This bill, after passing the usual forms, became a law on the -26th March, 1796. $\\dagger$\n\nBy this law, which has received\n\n\n* Among these Ambrose Spencer, esq. particularly distinguished himself as a most zealous friend to the proposed reform.\n$\\dagger$ By this law, two state-prisons were directed to be built ; one at New-York, and the other at Albany.

All offences above the degree of petit larceny, and not included in the above description, or otherwise punished, and stealing from a church, (before a capital offence) are made punishable for the first offence with imprisonment in the state prison to hard labour or solitude, all or either of them, at the discretion of the court, for a term not exceeding fourteen years. For the second offence the punishment is increased to imprisonment for life, hard labour or solitude, or both. Petit larcenies, buying and receiving stolen goods, \\&c. obtaining money, goods, \\&c. by fraud under false pretences, for the first offence are subjected to imprisonment, hard labour, or solitude, or both, or imprisonment only, as the court may direct, for a term not exceeding one year; persons guilty of a second offence have their punish. ment augmented for a time not exceeding three years.\n\nPersons sentenced to imprisonment for any time less than twelve months, are confined in the county gaols, and cannot be sent to the state-prison.\n\nCorporal punishment is wholly abolished; and no conviction or attainder for any crime, except treason, can work any forfeiture of goods, chattles, lands, tenaments, or hereditaments, or any right therein; and all forfeitures in nature of deodand; and in cases of suicide, or flight from justice, are done away.\n\nTo prevent escapes, by a law in alteration of the first law, persons sentenced for life, who break out and\nescape from the prison, and commit any felony above the degree of petit larceny, are punishable with death. Convicts sentenced to imprisonment for a term of years, who break out of prison, and are afterwards retaken, are to undergo imprisonment for a period double the time specified in the original judgment, to commence from the time of the last conviction, though at the time of being retaken, the original term had been expired; and as often as ally person, not adjudged to imprisonment for life, shall escape from prison, the period for which be was sentenced shall commence anew from the time of his escape.\n\nThe friends of reform were sensible that the new law was imperfect. The substituting of imprisonment for life for the punishment of death in certain cases, did not alter the relative proportion of punishment for crimes of different degrees of malignity;* and if guilty a second time of the same offence, though in degree inferior to the highest crime, the criminal is subjected to the highest penalty. Great changes, however, in matters so deeply interesting to the community, should not be too suddenly made.

It was prudent to listen to the voice\n\n\n*In the criminal code of Joseph II. Emperor of Germany, signed January 1787, the punishment of death is not to be found. High treason is punished by thirty years imprisonment, confiscation of property, and branding. Murder and other offences against human life aud bodily safety, are punished by imprisonment for thirty, twelve, eight, and five years, according to the different degrees of turpitude.\n\"If an equal punishment be ordained for two crimes that injure society in different degree, there is nothing to deter men from committing the greater, as often as it is attended with greater advantage.

A slight acquaintance with the nature of man and the history of society is sufficient to convince the considerate and (i)passionate observer that the full effects of an institution of this kind cannot be felt, nor the trial of its wisdom and efficacy be fairly and satisfactorily made, until after a long and presevering attention to its management and operations.\n\nIt is to be lamented, that many good citizens, feeling a just abhorrence at crimes, consulting the suggestions of virtuous indignation, rather than the principles of justice, become impatient that the alteration of the penal code has not yet produced greater and more decided effects, and diminished the number of the guilty. They, sometimes, even express a regret at the change which has been wrought in our laws, and returning to a system of accumulated severity and terror, wish to see every offence against life and property punished with death; as if crimes would cease with the extermination of the criminal. But let such turn their eyes inward upon their own hearts, and analyze the source from whence such wishes arise. Let them consider the effects produced on society and manners by the rapid increase of wealth and luxury, natural population, and emigration, which consequently augment the number of crimes, whether the laws be mild or sanguinary. Let them consult reason, and the experience of the most enlightened nations, which prove beyond all contradiction, that crimes are most frequent where the laws are most rigorous; that punishments mild and certain more effectually prevent crimes than those which are sanguinary and severe.
