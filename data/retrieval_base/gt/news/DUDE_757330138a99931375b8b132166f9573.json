        "text": "HEATHER DUTTON, CONTINUED FROM PAGE 9-11\n\nI grew up in the San Luis Valley, where my family has lived for 5 generations. After college, I was fortunate to get my job working for the Rio Grande Headwaters Restoration Project (RGHRP), improving the Rio Grande in Colorado. I am married to a great guy, Tanner, who works for the US Forest Service and shares my passion for managing natural resources and exploring the Rocky Mountains.\nGrowing up on a potato and barley farm I, like most people in the San Luis Valley, am rooted in water. In the Valley, our ability to harness and manipulate the natural hydrology and ecosystems is the only reason we can live here. Some of my fondest memories are driving around checking fields with my dad, trying to start siphon tubes with my brothers, skiing with my family, and camping along high mountain creeks during horse and llama pack trips. My parents showed us early on how important water is to both our way of life and weekend recreation. Now, I see the connectivity between the watershed, wildlife, and water users that I didn't understand as a child, but those early experiences were the foundation for my connection for water.\n\nIn the same way that we use our surrounding ecosystems to live in this harsh alpine valley in Southern Colorado, we have to respect the local ecology. It has been a privilege to work with members of the community to improve the Rio Grande for the farmers, wildlife, families, and fun lovers that cherish this beautiful area. Every time I help bring together a diverse group of partners to\ncomplete a project, big or small, I feel the same satisfaction and pride from being able to make a difference. I hope we can find ways to benefit as many water users as possible in every project. I also hope we can grow the State in a way that protects the very reason it is such a great place to live: water. I am committed to being completely engaged in the projects I am fortunate to be a part of, being respectful of other ideas, and being willing to explore new strategies so we can be very deliberate and thoughtful in the way we use water in the future.\n\nI was photographed at the McDonald Ditch Project. This is a partnership between the McDonald Ditch Company, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and RGHRP. The project includes removing the old, poorly functioning and dangerous diversion dam and building a new, more efficient dam with fish and boat passage, and automated headgates. We also restored a nearby wetland and will restore about 2,000 feet of streambanks. The result will be improved riparian and aquatic habitat, water quality, diversion efficiency, and recreation opportunity. We would not have been able to complete the project without all our wonderful local and state partners, and assistance from NRCS, Rio Grande County, and CWCB - the project was partly funded with a CWCB Water Supply Reserve Account grant and loan. The project will be completed in 2015 ! This project was one of the top 12 projects identified in the 2001 Study, our restoration master plan for the Rio Grande from South Fork to Alamosa, and it is very exciting to see it come to fruition.\n\nLURLINE UNDERBRINK CURRAN, CONTINUED FROM PAGE 9-32\nprovides opportunities for all to be heard, and Grand County's efforts provide a success story for how our water resources can be directed for benefit for all.\n\nI was raised in Grand County and have worked for Grand County for 33 years. I have two children, and eight grandchildren, all living in Grand County. I served as the Director for the Planning Department for 17 years and have been County Manager for 15 years. I have a BA from Regis University in Religious Studies and an MA in Psychology. My personal connection to water is being raised where the Colorado, Blue and Muddy rivers come together, recreating on all of them and forming a love for their contributions to my way of life. Professionally, I began my foray into the water world by reviewing the Wolford Mountain Project for Grand County and continuing to work on water matters as they arose over the years. Water is the life blood of Colorado, but especially to Grand County since we are the county in the state most impacted from transmountain diversions. Trying to retain and maintain a way of life that is precious to us has been a struggle and a passion.\n\nMy key accomplishments are tied to water. I had the honor of being selected the lead negotiator on the Colorado River Cooperative Agreement and Windy Gap Firming Project by the Board of County Commissioners. They gave me their trust and support. The components of both agreements are complex\nand extensive. The challenge is implementation. I am currently involved on the Learning by Doing Committee (an adaptive management program established by the Colorado River Cooperative Agreement and the Windy Gap Intergovernmental Agreement), the Windy Gap Bypass effort, Grand Lake Clarity, and the Big Lake Ditch Study. As a founding member of the 1177 Colorado River Basin Roundtable, I have been a part of many efforts, but most importantly Colorado's Water Plan.\n\nI hope that the water future of Grand County will not only be secured, but improved due to our agreements as well as the partnerships and cooperation we have and are continuing to build. These partnerships will grow and strengthen as younger people assume their places and a new way of managing our finite resource will be created that will pay benefits.\nOne of my fondest wishes is that my grandchildren and great grandchildren will be able to enjoy the experiences and beauty that the mighty Colorado River and its tributaries have provided to me and my children. My grandchildren are river rats and love being on the river. I hope that someday when I am older and more gray, and in the assisted living center here in Kremmling, they will be able to say, \"Grandma wasn't as crazy as we thought she was, she was part of a very important process that Grand County championed and defended.\"",

I worked with the United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency for 25 years and currently serve on the Colorado Farm Service Agency State Committee. I am the Executive Director of the Community Agricultural Alliance, an organization whose goals are to promote local agriculture, educate about the critical importance of agriculture and develop partnerships throughout the Valley between agriculture and consumer interests. The organization collaborates with the community's resort, recreation, business, and agricultural entities to assure agriculture's longevity throughout the Yampa Valley for future generations.\nOur family has water rights from the Elk River dating back to the late 1890's and I understand the critical importance of water availability for crops and livestock for our agricultural long-term sustainability. My professional connection with water started to develop in 2003 when Community Agriculture Alliance began to present water education forums and tours for the Steamboat Springs area. In 2010 CAA became the educational arm for the Yampa-WhiteGreen Round Table. We work with regional partners in Routt, Moffat and Rio Blanco Counties to develop and implement forums and workshops on water related issues important to the specific locale, the basin and the State. Water is important to me because it runs through my veins. My parents taught me early\nthe significance of stewarding our natural resources to assure their longevity. Now I feel I have a responsibility to share my personal experiences, knowledge and beliefs to help others understand why we should protect and conserve our water and land. Agriculture, urban and recreation interests have to work together to maintain the quality and quantity of our resources. My involvement with water education started by chance. My commitment to presenting unbiased, fair information evolved through the years and now my passion is to assure everyone has access to factual information. We can make the right decisions when we know the facts.\n\nMy family is an integral part of my life. My husband and I are pleased that both of our adult children returned to our Valley and our ranch after receiving their educations. All of us are active in our community serving on a variety of committees in the Steamboat area because we recognize agriculture must be involved with economic development, recreational opportunities, civic decisions and cultural protection. My activities and accomplishments related to water include that our ranch has been recognized by the Colorado Riparian Association, the Colorado Wildlife Commission, the Colorado Division of Wildlife, the Yampa River Legacy Committee and Environment 2000 for our efforts in soil, water and wildlife management. Professionally I feel good when someone comes to me after we finish a water education event saying they learned something and are glad they attended. Our grandchildren are being raised to appreciate and respect our natural resources through hard work and hard play. Yep, when you live in the Yampa Valley you also get to ski, hike, fish and recreate on a regular basis.",
