        "text": "Reqional News\n\n\nRegion's Leaders Assemble at Big Sky\n\n\n\nby Jack de Golia, Public Affairs Officer, Beaverhead National Forest\n\n\nThe 1990's are upon us. As the Forest Service moves into this final decade of its first century, we face new public attitudes, new demands, new stresses, and a new workforce. How can we adapt to all this newness and make the 90's a 'Decade of Guality'?\n\nThat was the central question the Region's leadership faced at a wecklong session at Big Sky, Montana, April 2 to 6 . Gathered in the shadow of the Gallatin NF's Spanish Peaks were most of the district rangers, forest supervisors, staff officers, and Regional Office directors.\n\nFollowing are some highlights of the conference. A complete summary will be available at each Forest.\n\n\nForest Supervisor Fred Trevey addresses attendees. Photo by Mark Wiggins.\n\nOn the opening day, the conference heard from Representative Pat Williams, the Montana Democrat from the First Congressional District. Williams charged that partisan politics were crippling Forest Service management and planning. He said Montana and Idaho have been energy \"colonies\" and that political interference in the management of the West's natural resources has reached an unprecedented level.\n\nWilliams said that the public will not long be denied in determining how the national forests are managed. He pointed to the agreement the Deerlodge National Forest reached with its Forest Plan appellants as an example of people finding local solutions, which he said are key to the future.\n\nNext, the group heard from Pat Jackson, a nationally acclaimed public relations expert. Jackson described the American public in the 90's as people overcommitted and overcommunicated with, only 8 to $10 \\%$ being concerned continued on page 2\n\nBig Sky resort on the Gallatin National Forest.\nPhoto by Jack de Golia.",

        "text": "The Leading Edge\n\n\n\nby John Mumma \\\\ Regional Forester\n\n\nThe \"Decade of Guality\"\n\nGetting together with the Region's leaders in April was an ideal way to begin the 1990's - the beginning of a decade I term \"The Decade of Quality.\" It is also a \"Decade of Change\" - changes in staff, changes in legislation, and changes in attitudes. These are all changes which will help to bring about quality.\n\nOur challenge in taking care of public lands today is tremendous. Our job is far more complex today than it used to be, and the complexity will continue. It's critical that we don't cling to old ways of doing business. We must be open, creative, and be agents of the changes that are coming, rather than be the effects of change.\n\nThe Forest Service can be the agency at the forefront of conservation in the world. We can and must be the leaders in wilderness management. We must set the mark; others will follow.\n\nMuch depends on you - each of you. As I told the people at the Regional Leadership Conference, consider a cup half filled with water. Is it half-empty or half-full? A half-empty cup may be considered a burden; a half-full cup, a challenge. It is your attitude that will make the difference.\n\nI have confidence in Region One folks. You are a dedicated, loyal group of people, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather work with as we meet the changes and challenges of the 90 's.\n\n1990 Leadership Conference, continued from page 1\nabout national forest issues. He said people want personal messages when they are interested in something. He said the letters \"PR\" stand for \"personalized communications.\"\n\nJackson said people don't care about the facts; they act on perceptions. (The phrase \"perception is reality\" was repeated throughout the week by many others who spoke.)\n\nHe noted that people form their opinions by checking with their \"opinion leaders,\" and said the Forest Service needs to focus its attention on opinion leaders and then work on their expectations. Jackson urged each person at the conference to find out who the real opinion leaders are around their Forest, and then assign an employee to each one. He suggested that we allow for personal communication between that opinion leader and employee throughout the year. Public affairs, he concluded, is each employee's job.\n\nThe next two days of the conference featured short concurrent sessions in such subjects as forest plan implementation, riparian management, public opinion, and biodiversity.\n\nOther guest speakers included Kimberly Woods, a consultant on human behavior, Dr. Jim Brock, Montana State University, and Dr. Caleb Rosario, Elizabethtown College, PA. A panel of Forest Service leaders presented findings of a survey of employces' attitudes and frustrations.\n\nThe last day the conference heard from Linda Rix, the Region's consultant on affirmative action. Ms. Rix said \"numbers give marvelous illusions, and rarely tell the story.\" She said activity should never be confused with accomplishment.\n\nShe praised the Forest Service for making \"workforce diversity\" a real management responsibility and not just a perfunctory process, as it is in many agencies. Rix's main point was that affirmative action programs are for the long term and should try to\n\n\nA group works on Forest Plan implementation during a breakout session.\nimprove work life for all employees. The ultimate goal is for no job to be reserved for one group or another.\n\nThroughout the conference there was an exhibit area in the main Huntley Lodge. Exhibits on several national forests and many\nsubjects, ranging from smokejumping to minerals management, were on display.\n\nSo, what was the value of the conference? The speakers, exhibits, and sessions all helped people learn things. But, perhaps the greatest value for the people attending was the chance to see people they ordinarily didn't see, from a spectrum of specialities and places. The after-hours discussions did as much to bond everyone to the common task as anything that was on the agenda.\n\nIf nothing else, everyone became more aware of the challenges of the new decade, heard others wrestling with similar issues, and perhaps found the seeds of ideas that can sprout and flourish during the Decade of Quality.",

Last year the emphasis was to accommodate the centennial events of Montana, as well as North and South Dakota. Priorities for 1990 are Idaho events, as it is their centennial year.

Along with spectacular scenery, the river valley offers all the essentials that make for perfect bighorn sheep habitat - steep cliffs for protection from\n\nand equipment to develop the site. Landowners Buz and Les Hodges, who generously share their fields with the bighorn sheep herd, donated the land for the vehicle pull-out. A high school shop class built cedar benches for the area; a local nursery donated plants for landscaping; timber companies donated building materials; and two sporting organizations worked with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, volunteering their labor to build a pole fence to kcep visitors out of the field and sheep off the pullout.\n\nAs part of their new wildlife appreciation program, the Lolo NF supplied six interpretive signs that describe bighorn sheep biology, habitat, and management. Craig Phillips, a local wildlife artist, donated his time to beautifully illustrate the signs.\n\nIf you get the chance to travel along Highway 200, pull off the road at the Koo-koo-sint Bighorn Sheep Viewing Area.

However, according to the National\n Audubon Society, American Birding Association, Western Bird Banding Association and other interest groups, no consolidated checklist exists.\n\nIn an effort to develop such a list, along with locations and other data useful in forest planning and management, the Custer National Forest proposes the following challenge to all Montana Forests. Annually, in May and June of 1990, each Forest sponsor a 2-4 person team of birders who try to locate as many species of birds as possible in a 24 -hour period. The search area must be inside or within 15 air miles of the competing Forest.\n\nA state-wide coordinator will compile the lists and share information with all Forests and interest groups. A suitable, travelling placque will be awarded annually to the winning Forest. In 1990 the coordinator will be Carl Wolf, Custer National Forest.
