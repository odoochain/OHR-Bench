The Health Unit was formerly referred to as the \"First-Aid\" or ${ }^{\\text {semergency Rooma }}$ E Now we prefer to think of it as the \"Health Unit\" and more emphasis is placed on Health Care of course, first-aid treatment of even minor wounds is still important and accidents should be reported promptly.\n\nThe actual treatment of illnesses is limited since we do not have a physician directily in charge. However, authorization is given for the administration of simple medication for the alleviation of some minor symptoms and disorders. You are advised to come to the Health Unit when symptoms of a cold or sore throat begin. Early treatment might prevent serious developments.\n\nSimple medications are available for mild stomach upsets or indigestion ${ }_{3}$ but remember: Such symptoms can, also, indicate more sexious involvements. If you have fever or other symptoms of importance, you may be advised to consult your physician.\n\nHypodermic injections of medications, such as vitamins, may be given upon written authorization from your physicion. A special form may be obtained from the Health Unit for this purpose.\n\nIf your doctor advises temporary rest during the day following major surgery or an extended illness, you may, with the approval of your supervisor, rest in the Health Unit for a period not in excess of one hour.\n\nWe suggest that you report to the Health Unit if you have had a serious illness or have some existing ailment. It would be helpful to have a record of your condition and the name of your physician in case you should become ill at work and need immediate assistance.\n\nTo ALL USDA EMPLOYEES: The USDA Club is still offering Polio Vaccine injections through the Health Unit.
