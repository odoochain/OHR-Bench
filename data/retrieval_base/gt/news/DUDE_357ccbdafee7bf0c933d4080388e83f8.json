Has Madison La Follet\n\"Hey! Has Madison La Follette been out here yet? We want to see this super guy - Rick Olson,\" said Ashley. \"Awh! They've already practiced. Ol son's supposed to set a scoring record\nwith his first state tournament basket. Well, we'll cut him down tomorrow. Coach is going to stay undefeated at state.\"\n$\\qquad$ Duckett and Ashley reflect the strong confidence of the Milwauke Area Conference Blue Devils as they Area Conference Blue Devils, as they look for their second Wisconsin Inter Class A boys' basketball championship in three years and hope championship in three years, and hope to keep alive their popular coach Garmer Currie. The Blue Devils and other players may be sure of their respective player may be sure of their respective teams che choice is up in the air\nthe choice Steven the air\nUndek North? Or maybe leght ning-quick North? Or, maybe deadly\n\nshooting La Follette? How about rangy South Milwaukee? Perhaps the winner of the Sheboygan South Shawano game, or maybe dark horse like Brown Deer or Lake Geneva Badger?\never there was a state toma ment without a Class A favorite, it's the 67th annual classic opening toda at the Field House. Answer time won' come until Saturday night. Now it's question time, and every coach is hedging abour a fave ine Coach Mar Madne\nCoaches dont like being \"experts,\" because so-called experts are ofte wrong. So, there's a reason for reluc\n\nThey all look with envy at Class C Kohler and its prized player, 6 -foot$101 / 2$ Joe Wolf with his 32 -point average.\n\nStevens Point holds the only Class A perfect record at $22-0$. Brown Deer lost just once and Shawano, with a lost just once and shawano, with a\nmarvelous basketball tradition, has just two losses - by one-point margins. It's a tournament with a \"nofavorite\" look\n\nThe top-ranked Stevens Point Panthers drew most nominations - but only because of their record. Panther Coach John schell, veteran state tournament basketban player win\n\"You 190s, had a quick answer. You can't pick favorites down here. The fact phat were the only undefeated team doesnt mean a thing We made it as a team, wh no Pres pres lose.\n\nPredictions of a wide-open tourna ment are refreshingly new. This one, it seems, has top-drawer talent. That's why it's very attractive\nSome of those top-drawer Class A stars are Olson, Lake Geneva's Gary Ruch, Brown Deer's Derrick Rogers, Points 6-7 Jay Laszewski and Toda Barnes, South Mirwaukee's Joe Finn Shawano's Greg Polzin, Sheboygan South's Keith Leonard and the hustling Ashley.\nested at 1:05 p.m. today when Lake Geneva (19-3) opens against Brown Deer (21-1), and Madison La Follette (17-5) faces Milwaukee North (15-7) at 2:45. Tonight's session has Shawano (20-2) playing Sheboygan South (15-7) at 7:05 and South Milwaukee (19-3) against Stevens Point (22-0)\n\nBrown Deer's Keith Peters, once a state Class C championship coach in Alaska, has led the Falcons to their first winning season in almost two decades. He offered two answers to the prediction question:\n\"Are you asking me who's the favorite or who I think will win? The favorite, by record, should be Stevens Point. But, you know I think the winner might come from the Sheboygan South-Shawano game. Shawano's good, with a great tradition, and South's record is deceiving. They're coming out of a league that probably was at its toughest in years.\"\n\nShawano's Norm Davis looks toward Milwaukee and Madison, and warns not to overlook South Milwaukee. \"I always lean toward the two big cities with teams like North and La Follette,\" Davis said. \"They're usually talented and scrappy. But, Stevens Point still has to be impressive.\n\nLa Follette's Pete Olson, whose Big\n\nEight Conference player of the year, Rick Olson, is averaging 28 points a game, agrees, in part, with Davis.\n\"In recent years, Milwaukee-area teams have been very good,\" Olson said. \"Stevens Point's numbers are im pressive, but all we're thinking about is North If we shoot well, we could win it all.\"\n\"Stevens Point!\" says South Mil waukee's Don Karnowski, with em phasis. The Rocket coach, however admitted his choice is easy because his Milwaukee Suburban Conference eam plays the Panthers first. \"They have the record and the top ranking We have a tough team and its success didn't surprise me, but we're concerned with Point.\"\nCurrie, however, is looking to the winner of the La Follette-North game.\n\"We're ready after beating ourselves in several games this year. If we can get by La Follette . . Well, that's the game for us,\" he said\n\nTradition has proven that few favored teams emerge as champions. Manitowoc fell two years ago, and La Crosse Central's once-beaten Raiders didn't live up to expectations in 1979. Last year, Milwaukee Madison, with five losses and a dark horse role, won it all before relinquishing the title later because of a player-eligibility\nrule.\nDespite that upset tradition, sheboygan South's Bob Ryskoski, whose two sons, Keith and Scott, play Point\n\"We had a slow start, and our seven osses are deceiving,\" Ryskoski said We're playing best right now, but \"ess you still have to go with Point.\nLake Geneva's Jerry Stelse was as undecided as any of his colleagues Yet, he figures his Badgers have a chance, and if it should come down to free-throw shooting, 6-4 Gary Ruch and 6-3 Tim Schneider may give Stelse's team the edge. They hit 41 points between them in the sectional\n\nLa Follette wouldn't trade its deadly shooting Olson for anyone at the line. The $6-1$ senior guard is an 86 percent free-throw shooter. He and he Lancers will be the sentimental avorites in Madison after pulling out pair of stunning last-second regional and sectional victories over Stoughton and Madison West.\n\"There are some dandies down here,\" said Lancer Coach Olson. That's what makes it a state tournament.\"\nSo it all begins today - without a favorite, but with a lot of king-sized hopes.",
