Though the presses were down, the record of the visit as it would have appeared in The Times is intact-in \"The Pope's Journey to the United States,\" a 160-page paperback published by Bantam Press 48 hours after the Pope returned to Rome.\n\nSeveral days before the Pope's arrival, Metropolitan Editor A. M. Rosenthal and Assistant Metropolitan Editor Arthur Gelb worked out the assignment schedule they would follow Oct. 4 if the paper was printing. When it became apparent that it would not be, the reporters, editors and photographers on the schedule were asked if they would cover the same assignments for Bantam. Their response, Abe Rosenthal said, was \"immediate, warm, professional.\"\n\nReporters and editors, Guild members and non-Guild members alike (the former with Guild approval) went to work in a make-shift city room on the second floor of the Bantam offices at Madison Avenue and 40th Street. The space, which ordi-\nnarily houses Bantam's production department, had been stripped of its regular furnishings. Long rectangular tables and chairs rented from a banquet supply service, served as desks. Typewriters, assembled from Bantam's bookkeeping department, were lined up on the tables and on\nany other flat space. The copy desk was set up in what is ordinarily the stock room; the editors' desk was in the handsomely carpeted office of Bantam's vice president in charge of production. Four rented TV sets were placed at strategic\n(Continued on Page 3)\n\nBack to Work In a Big Way\n\nThe Times roared back into action in late afternoon Oct. 10, after its giant machine had been silent for 24 days.\n\nMinutes after the pickets tore up their signs at 3:20 P.M. Sunday, the push was on for Monday's paper. Reporters were back at their typewriters; copy desks filled almost immediately; printers moved directly to their tasks. Advertising, circulation, production and news executives were ready with alternate plans for Monday's paper. They had layouts for a 96 page issue and for an 80-pager. They decided, for mechanical and distribution reasons, to go with the 80 -page layout. This meant that with a later-than-normal press start they could still get a bigger-than-normal press run. Had they chosen the 96 -page paper to accommodate more\nadvertising, the number of printed copies would have been proportionately reduced and would have come off the presses too late for delivery.\n\nThe original schedule had called for an 11 P.M. close in the composing room. But when so many printers showed up, in response to telegrams sent out by General Foreman George Lapolla, the target was advanced an hour.\n\nBy 6 P.M. the composing room was operating with almost double its normal Sunday night crew. To ease its burden, type for the four \"Catch-up\" pages bridging the strike period, and for 10 pages of classified ads had been set in advance in union job shops. Display advertisers had furnished their material in complete plate form, ready for publication except for being mounted on metal in the photoengraving and stereo job shop. This made it possible for Mr. Lapolla to\n(Continued on Page 7)",

        "text": "Screen: Times Staff Stars in Documentary\n\nWide Window of Mr. Malone' Held Worthy of Oscar\n\nBy bosley crowther\nThe agreeably poetic concept of the\nTimes as a window through which the Times as a window through which the reader may scan the daily happenings of\nconsequence throughout the world neatly developed in the context of a dandy film about the making of The Times that George Pitt has put together under the It is essentially andiow of Mr. Malone.\" and in its 27 minutes running time it gives the viewer a, capsule comprehension of how this great newspaper is producedhow its far-flung correspondents diligently\npatrol their beats, patrol their beats, gathering news and\ndispatching their stories and their interpretive observations to New York; and how the local staffs, editors and mechanical craftsmen assemble, arrange, compose and print the comprehensive publication\nthat daily provides Mr. Malone with his window upon the world.\nBut it is this image of the paper as a window-as one of the several devices through which a person may look and obtain ever-widening information about\neverything of importance that goes oneverything of importance that goes on-\nthat gives the picture its filip, the nice metaphorical thrust that makes the business of producing a newspaper seem mor\nimportant and dramatic and bold.\n\nThe trick is accomplished simply. Mr. Pitt has begun the film by introducing typical Times reader, the titular George\nMalone. He is a young New York business executive who commutes from the suburbs and looks out upon his immediate world from several ordinary windows be\nfore he opens the morning's Times. the magnitude of this expansion is dramatically visualized by bringing a copy of The Times into the framing of a high picture window looking out upon the sweep\nof New York harbor. Thus the image is forcefully imposed.\nFrom here on the substance of the picure is the story of The Times-a quick Henry J. Raymond through Adolph S Henry J. Raymond through Adolph S.\nOchs to the present; a series of tours with correspondents in London, Paris, Rome, Hong Kong, Tokyo; a fast look-in on metropolitan coverage and administrative activities in the city room; an indication\nof the range of special writers who make The Times go.\nThe emphasis in the continuity and in the explanatory narration is upon the intricate organization and teamwork required and involved in getting out a bal-\nanced, clear newspaper every day against the tyranny of time. There is emphasis, too, upon the knowledge, judgment and the paper. No one wears a hat edit the paper.\ncity room.\nIt is notable that time is not wasted and the patience of the viewer is not taxed with perfunctory introductions and pay\nment of respects ment of respects to the top brass. No\none is even mentioned in the picture is an editor or writer named-except few who are passingly identified in conversation, such as Ed O'Toole, who is spotted filing a story from Brussels on\nthe European Common Market, whic story becomes the example of, whic story passes from the writer to the printed page.\nThis process may be less clearly detailed than the literal-minded viewer might wish. And there are also some glaring The Times, such as thajor operations of of the Sunday sections putting together Book Review; the assembling of the finan cial section, the gathering and handling of photographs. But omissions must be of time. And of course the limitation will be most sensitive about them ar those whose functions are not mentioned on the screen.\nBut again the empathy of the picture is with the totally committed team that for the service of Mr. Malone, who is re-\nverted to several times through the picture. Thus the lasting impression of the whole is one of awe and admiration for everybody who helps to make The Times. As for Mr. Pits production, it is an making - skillfully photographed, with camera-shy people directed to look and behave quite naturally; edited for good, harp pace and movement, and packed musical score of Gino Marinuzzi, Jr, is subtly productive of proper moods, and Alexander Scourby delivers the narration as though he were a working newspaper-\nman.\nNo single person in the \"cast\" is likely win an Oscar (outside of Sophia Loren, who pops up briefly in one clip as an\nexample of what a Times reviewer enjoys). Claude Sitton is given a lot of foot ge and makes a good road-company termy stewart; Tony Lewis indicates very clearly that a correspondent listens a wicked typewriter; Abe Rosenthal chews a pipe judiciously and Dick Witkin gives a stirring indication of how Scoop the is likely to be snater off. But no on paperman in a Hollywood film. We're Working Press, not actors. That's a point to remember, Mr. Malone.\nThe intention is to make this picture nontheatrical release on 16 mm .\n\n\n\n\nBronze Medal for Film\n\"The Wide Window of Mr. Malone\" it won for George Pitt, its producer, bronze medal in the category of docu-\nmentaries in the Fifth Annual New York Film and Television Festival.\n\nThey Wrote a Book\nspots so the staff could follow the pro-\nceedings. ceedings.

By early evening more than 25 report ers and editors were crowded into the cramped quarters, and there was an air of gaiety and camaraderie not possible in\nthe block-long city room on 43 d Street. the beck-1ong city room on 43d Street.\nIt seemed more like the Hollywood, or \"Front Page,\" version of a newspaper shop-the air heavy with smoke, report-\ners sitting down at any typewriter not ers sitting down at any typewriter not\noccupied at the moment, the floor littered occupied athe moment, the floor littered with discarded paper and empty coffee\ncontainers. Rosenthal and Gelb, accus tomed to summoning their staff by loud-\nspeaker, found themselves tripping over speaker, found themselves tripping over\nthem instead and within easy whispering range of them all.\nBantam had set a copy deadline of 5\no'clock Tuesday morning and this o'clock Tuesday morning, and this, too,\nwas un-Timesy. The staff, accustomed to was un-Timesy. The staff, accustomed to\nthe pressure of far earlier ones, founa it hard to adjust to the extra time. Report ers standing in line to get at one of the 10 available typewriters, fidgeted at the\ndelay. Drew Middleton, who wrote the\nstory of the Pope's U.N. speech, indulge himself as morning newspapermen rarel copy about 8 o'clock. After it cleared the desk, he left. A few hours later he was\nback.

When it becam obvious there would be no work let-up,\nmounds of delicatessen sandwiches were ordered in. The staff wolfed them. The sequence of the book had been worked out in advance by Mr. Rosenthal and charge of the project. As copy cam Jff the typewriters, it went first to Rosenthal and Gelb for a general go-over, then to the copy desk in the stock room to be in the same office, took it then and converted it into \"bookese\"-readied it, that is, for the printer.\nBy midnight, reporters assigned to late events of the Pope's day reached the\nBantam office and began to write thei stories. At 4 A. M. Bill Farrell, who had covered the evening mass at Yankee Sta dium, was still pounding away.

It was $4: 15$ in the morn ing when he walked into the vice pres dent's office and dropped his last \"take\" on Rosenthal's desk. Abe gave it a swift\nreading and turned it over to Sheldon Binn, who was in charge of the copy desk. \"That's it,\" he told Binn. \"Finished.\" Bigart and Rosenthal poured the remains of a whisky \"Wottle\" Rosenthal asked, \"what did you think of the Pope?\"\n\"I didn't see him,\" said Bigart, who had been chained all day and night to his typewriter\nAt 7:30 A.M.
