In the wee hours of Friday morning, not long after President Biden had walked off the stage from a disastrous debate, his campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, acknowledged in a series of private calls with prominent supporters that the night had gone poorly but urged them not to overreact. Later on Friday, top White House aides worked the phones with Mr. Biden's chief of staff, Jef Zients, calling the Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, to check in, according to a person familiar with the call. And by the afternoon, the Biden campaign had transformed its weekly all-staff call into a virtual pep talk to dispel any doubts creeping into the campaign offices in Wilming ton, Del., and beyond. \"Nothing fundamentally changed about this election las night,\" said Quentin Fulks, Mr. Bi den's deputy campaign manager according to a recording of the allstaff meeting. \"We're going to get punched.
