The Firm reported ROE of $23 \\%$ and ROTCE of $29 \\%$. The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $\\$ 5.2$ billion compared to an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $\\$ 6.8$ billion in the prior year, as well as a $\\$ 550$ million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.\n- Net income was $\\$ 14.3$ billion, up $\\$ 11.4$ billion.\n- Total net revenue was up $14 \\%$. Noninterest revenue was $\\$ 19.4$ billion, up 40\\%, predominantly driven by higher CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in the prior year. Net interest income was $\\$ 12.9$ billion, down $11 \\%$, predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.\n- Noninterest expense was $\\$ 18.7$ billion, up $12 \\%$, predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenuerelated expense and continued investments in the businesses. The increase in expense also included a \\$550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.\n- The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $\\$ 4.2$ billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses of $\\$ 5.2$ billion, compared to an expense of $\\$ 8.3$ billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net additions to the allowance for credit losses of $\\$ 6.8$ billion.\n- The total allowance for credit losses was $\\$ 25.6$ billion at March 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of $2.42 \\%$, compared with $2.95 \\%$ in the fourth quarter of 2020 , and $2.32 \\%$ in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the allowance for loan losses.\n- The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $\\$ 10.3$ billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $\\$ 3.2$ billion from the prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, nonperforming assets decreased $\\$ 649$ million from December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil \\& Gas and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.\n- Firmwide average loans of $\\$ 1.0$ trillion were up $1 \\%$, driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") in CCB and CB.\n- Firmwide average deposits of \\$2.2 trillion were up 36\\%, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (\"HQLA\") of approximately \\$697 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $\\$ 841$ billion, resulting in approximately $\\$ 1.5$ trillion of liquidity sources.

The Firm continues to participate in the Small Business Association's (\"SBA\") PPP and since inception of the Program has funded approximately $\\$ 40$ billion as of April 30, 2021. While the Firm's temporary assistance measures for those impacted by the pandemic have steadily declined since early 2020, the Firm continues to assist those impacted, primarily in the form of payment deferrals.\n\nRefer to Credit Portfolio on page 47 for further information on PPP; Consumer Credit portfolio on pages 48-52 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 for further information on retained loans under payment deferral. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on PPP; Consumer Credit Portfolio on page 116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on retained loans under payment deferral.\nThe Firm remains focused on the well-being of its employees. While the vast majority of its global workforce continue to work from home, the Firm is actively monitoring the health and safety situations at local and regional levels, and will adapt its plans as these situations evolve.\n\nRegulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nTo address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government as well as central banks and banking authorities around the world have taken and continue to take actions to help individuals, households and businesses that have been adversely affected by the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. In the U.S., several stimulus packages were enacted including the CARES Act in March of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in March of 2021, which provided funding to support loan facilities to assist consumers and businesses and stimulus payments to individuals.\nRefer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 52-53 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form $10-\\mathrm{K}$ for further discussion on U.S. government actions impacting the Firm and U.S. government facilities and programs in which the Firm has participated.\n\nPost Brexit\n\nPrior to December 31, 2020 the Firm substantially completed its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program which was intended to ensure the continuity of its business and operations with respect to EU clients. On March 26, 2021, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding that sets out a framework for regulatory cooperation in relation to cross-border financial services. The Firm will monitor developments and take any necessary actions to ensure business continuity with respect to the Firm's EU clients. Refer to Business Developments on page 50 of the 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nInterbank Offered Rate (\"IBOR\") transition On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12 -month LIBOR) will cease immediately following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and twomonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31, 2021, and the Firm is prioritizing those currencies and tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation in 2021.\nThe Firm continues to make progress on its initiatives to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR discontinuation, including contract remediation. The Firm also continues to monitor the transition relief being considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the tax implications of reference rate reform. Refer to Business Developments on page 51 of the 2020 Form 10 - K for a discussion of the Firm's initiatives to address the expected discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other IBORs.",

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for information on investment securities gains.\nMortgage fees and related income increased predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production margins and volumes.

Refer to OffBalance Sheet Arrangements on page 15 and Notes 13 and 22 for further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.\nLong-term debt was relatively flat as maturities and fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to higher rates were offset by net issuances. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for additional information. Stockholders' equity was relatively flat as net income was offset by the impact of capital actions and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). The decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow hedges.

        "text": "BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\n\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer \\& Community Banking, Corporate \\& Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset \\& Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm's Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm's use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a definition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm's LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm's clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenuesharing agreements.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.\nRefer to Business Segment Results - Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 65-66 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.",

        "text": "FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase's business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm's overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:\n- Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;\n- Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n- Firmwide structures for risk governance.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm's performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.\n\nRisk governance and oversight framework\nThe Firm's risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.\n\nThe Firm's risk governance and oversight functions align to:\n\nDrivers of Risks\nFactors that cause a risk to exist\n\nRisk governance and oversight functions\nThe following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2020 Form $10-\\mathrm{K}$ discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm's business activities.\n\\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n  & Form 10-Q page reference & Form 10-K page reference \\\\\n  Strategic risk & & 90 \\\\\nCapital risk & $36-41$ & $91-101$ \\\\\nLiquidity risk & $42-46$ & $102-108$ \\\\\nReputation risk & $48-52$ & $114-120$ \\\\\nConsumer credit risk & $53-62$ & $121-131$ \\\\\nWholesale credit risk & 65 & 134 \\\\\nInvestment portfolio risk & $66-70$ & $135-142$ \\\\\nMarket risk & 71 & $143-144$ \\\\\nCountry risk & 72 & $145-151$ \\\\\nOperational risk & & 148 \\\\\nCompliance risk & & 149 \\\\\nConduct risk & 73 & 150 \\\\\nLegal risk & & 151 \\\\\n  Estimations and Model risk & & \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nRefer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.\n35",

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm's business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.\n\nThe Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized.\n\nRefer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm's Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for a further discussion of the Firm's Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and stress testing.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (\"BHCs\") and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (\"IDI\") subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (\"Basel III Standardized\"), and an advanced approach (\"Basel III Advanced\"). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective minimum capital ratios.\n\nThe Firm's Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-riskbased ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\nCECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided the option beginning January 1,2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 (\"CECL capital transition provisions\").\nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $\\$ 4.5$ billion, which is the $\\$ 2.7$ billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and $25 \\%$ of the $\\$ 7.0$ billion increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD loans).\n\nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance.\n\nSLR temporary revision. The Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect through March 31, 2021.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and FDIC issued an interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this exclusion.\nPPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had approximately $\\$ 32$ billion of loans under the program.\n\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Lending (\"PPPL\") Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude them under the final rule.\nTLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total LossAbsorbing Capacity (\"TLAC\") debt instruments by certain large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC debt instruments issued by systemically important banking organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm's risk-based capital metrics.",

Deposits continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm's reported LCR under the LCR rule.\n\nThe Firm's average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.\n\nOther liquidity sources\n\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $\\$ 841$ billion and $\\$ 740$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $\\$ 301$ billion and $\\$ 307$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n\nNSFR\n\nThe net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of \"available\" and \"required\" amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least $100 \\%$ on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.\nThe Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100\\% minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based on its current understanding of the final rule.",

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, reflecting higher secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading assets in CIB, and the impact of client activities in CIB.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm's demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm's liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and marketmaking portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm's sources of short-term unsecured funding consist of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The increase in commercial paper at March 31, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.\n44",

Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to sales in CIB.\nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $\\$ 22.2$ billion at March 31, 2021. This amount included $\\$ 8.6$ billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $\\$ 7.3$ billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.\n\nAt March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $\\$ 25.9$ billion and $\\$ 25.6$ billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higherbalance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were consistent with the broader residential mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is generally in line with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm's residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  (in millions) & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{March 31, 2021} & \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{$$\\text { December 31, } 2020$$} \\\\\n  Current & \\$ & 775 & \\$ & 669 \\\\\n  30-89 days past due & & 146 & & 235 \\\\\n  90 or more days past due & & 798 & & 874 \\\\\n  Total government guaranteed loans & \\$ & 1,719 & \\$ & 1,778 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-tovalue ratio of residential real estate loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm's residential real estate loans.\n\nModified residential real estate loans\n\nThe following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs.

Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm's expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments.\n\nReceivables from customers\n\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDerivative contracts\n\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (\"ETD\"), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (\"OTC-cleared\") derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm's over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements - excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily - was approximately $88 \\%$ at both March 31,2021 , and December 31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$ 73.1$ billion and $\\$ 79.6$ billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables for the counterparty. The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.\n\nDerivative receivables\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  (in millions) & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{March 31, 2021} & \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{December 31,\n$$2020$$} \\\\\n  Total, net of cash collateral & \\$ & 73,119 & \\$ & 79,630 \\\\\n  Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables & & $(13,958)$ & & $(14,806)$ \\\\\n  Total, net of liquid securities and other cash collateral & \\$ & 59,161 & \\$ & 64,824 \\\\\n  Other collateral held against derivative receivables & & $(5,716)$ & & $(6,022)$ \\\\\n  Total, net of collateral & \\$ & 53,445 & \\$ & 58,802 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",

        "text": "ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:\n- the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n- the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and\n- the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm's HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of:\n- a $\\$ 4.5$ billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and\n- a $\\$ 716$ million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios\n\nWhile the economy is showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm's models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances.\n\nFurther, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross\ndomestic product (\"GDP\") returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.\n\nThe Firm's central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Assumptions at March 31, 2021} \\\\\n  & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\n  U.S. unemployment rate ${ }^{(a)}$ & $5.7 \\%$ & $4.8 \\%$ & $4.3 \\%$ \\\\\n  Cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 & $0.2 \\%$ & $2.7 \\%$ & $4.3 \\%$ \\\\\n  \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Assumptions at December 31, 2020} \\\\\n  & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\n  U.S. unemployment rate ${ }^{(a)}$ & $6.8 \\%$ & $5.7 \\%$ & $5.1 \\%$ \\\\\n  Cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 & $(1.9) \\%$ & $0.6 \\%$ & $2.0 \\%$ \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.\n\nRefer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm's allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 74-76 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.\n\nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 48-52, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 and Note 11 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.",

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held non-traded financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.\n\nInvestment securities risk\n\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $\\$ 595.4$ billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 66-70 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for further information on related liquidity risk.\n\nPrincipal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are typically privately held nontraded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm's business strategies. The Firm's investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm's commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. The Firm's principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results.

This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur, such as those observed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 73.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm's existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time.\n\nValue-at-risk\nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (\"VaR\"), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\nThe Firm's Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95\\% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (\"Regulatory VaR\"), which is used to derive the Firm's regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm's VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.

        "text": "Earnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm's reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm's interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (\"non-U.S. dollar\" currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:\n- The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n- Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience.\n- The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.\n\nThe Firm's earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm's interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm's net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information).\nThe Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  (in billions) & & $$\\text { March 31, } 2021$$ & & December 31,\n$$2020$$ \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Parallel shift:} \\\\\n  +100 bps shift in rates & \\$ & 6.0 & \\$ & 6.9 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Steeper yield curve:} \\\\\n  +100 bps shift in long-term rates & & 1.6 & & 2.4 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Flatter yield curve:} \\\\\n  +100 bps shift in short-term rates & & 4.4 & & 4.5 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe change in the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflected updates to the Firm's baseline for higher long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's balance sheet.\nThe Firm's sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits.\nBased upon current and implied market rates as of March 31, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings-at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income. In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require additional management judgment and therefore, the actual outcomes may differ from these assumptions.\nThe Firm's non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n  & March 31, 2021 & December 31, 2020 \\\\\n  (in billions) & & & \\\\\nParallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates & $\\mathbf{0 . 9}$ & $\\$$ & 0.9 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm's earnings-at-risk at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.",

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.\n\nAllowance for credit losses\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:\n- The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n- The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n- The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm's HTM and AFS securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm's policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm's allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63-64 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm's allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm's methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest\neffect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n- Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\n- Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm's assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that affected borrowers across the Firm's consumer and wholesale lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm's central scenario described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm's relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 2.4\\% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $4.4 \\%$ in the third quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining $2.6 \\%$ lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of nearly $6.6 \\%$ in the third quarter of 2021 ; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of $17.4 \\%$ and a trough in the second quarter of 2022.",

        "text": "This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:\n- the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario\n- the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables\n- the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not seen in recent history, which continues to add higher degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss estimations\n- significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, effects of government support and customer assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the Firm's estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described below.\n\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2021, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm's allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison between these two scenarios reflects the following differences:\n- An increase of approximately $\\$ 700$ million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments\n- An increase of approximately $\\$ 3.6$ billion for credit card loans\n- An increase of approximately $\\$ 2.1$ billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments\nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\n\nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2021.\nFair value\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\n\nAssets measured at fair value\n\nThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  March 31, 2021 (in billions, except ratios) & \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Total assets at fair value} & \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Total level 3 assets} \\\\\n  Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements & \\$ & 267.6 & \\$ & $-$ \\\\\n  Securities borrowed & & 66.3 & & - \\\\\n  Trading assets: & & & & \\\\\n  Trading-debt and equity instruments & \\$ & 470.9 & \\$ & 2.7 \\\\\n  Derivative receivables ${ }^{(a)}$ & & 73.1 & & 7.9 \\\\\n  Total trading assets & & 544.0 & & 10.6 \\\\\n  AFS securities & & 379.9 & & - \\\\\n  Loans & & 50.8 & & 1.8 \\\\\n  MSRs & & 4.5 & & 4.5 \\\\\n  Other & & 383.7 & & 0.5 \\\\\n  Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis & & $1,362.9$ & & 17.4 \\\\\n  Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis & & 2.5 & & 0.7 \\\\\n  Total assets measured at fair value & \\$ & $1,365.4$ & \\$ & 18.1 \\\\\n  Total Firm assets & \\$ & $3,689.3$ & & \\\\\n  Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets ${ }^{(a)}$ & & & & $0.5 \\%$ \\\\\n  Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value ${ }^{(a)}$ & & & & $1.3 \\%$ \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $\\$ 7.9$ billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset.

        "text": "Valuation\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm's creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm's valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\n\nGoodwill impairment\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment.\n\nRefer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2021.\n\nCredit card rewards liability\nThe credit card rewards liability was $\\$ 8.0$ billion and $\\$ 7.7$\nbillion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 154 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm's credit card rewards liability.\n\nIncome taxes\nRefer to Income taxes on page 154-155 of JPMorgan\nChase's 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes.\n\nLitigation reserves\n\nRefer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.",

        "text": "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\n\n\nNote 1 - Basis of presentation\n\nJPMorgan Chase \\& Co. (\"JPMorgan Chase\" or the \"Firm\"), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968 , is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm's business segments.\n\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated.\n\nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm's effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm's results of operations on a managed basis.\n\nConsolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\n\nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.",

Transaction costs for the Firm's physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm's physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value.

To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $\\$ 678$ million and $\\$ 670$ million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31,2021 , and December 31,2020 , were trading assets of $\\$ 55$ million and $\\$ 52$ million, respectively, and other assets of $\\$ 623$ million and $\\$ 618$ million, respectively.\n(e) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included within loans were $\\$ 20.1$ billion and $\\$ 15.1$ billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $\\$ 6.0$ billion and $\\$ 6.3$ billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $\\$ 11.9$ billion and $\\$ 8.4$ billion, respectively.\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n(g) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm's valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\nThe following table presents the Firm's primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.\nIn the Firm's view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm's estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.",

However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.",

Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan's allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan's expected credit losses over its remaining expected life.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm's U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.",

The majority of the Firm's COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because:\n- they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm's regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or\n- the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses.\nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.",

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (\"Chapter 7 loans\") as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2021, approximately $7 \\%$ of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance.

Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower's most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n(h) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n(i) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2021.\n(j) At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $\\$ 76$ million.

        "text": "Loan modifications\n\nModifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was $\\$ 251$ million and $\\$ 142$ million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.\n\nNature and extent of modifications\n\nThe Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.\n\nThe following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm's loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Three months ended March 31,} \\\\\n  & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\n  Number of loans approved for a trial modification & 1,401 & 1,996 \\\\\n  Number of loans permanently modified & 1,714 & 1,481 \\\\\n  Concession granted: ${ }^{(a)}$ & & \\\\\n  Interest rate reduction & $72 \\%$ & $79 \\%$ \\\\\n  Term or payment extension & 40 & 81 \\\\\n  Principal and/or interest deferred & 31 & 11 \\\\\n  Principal forgiveness & 4 & 4 \\\\\n  Other ${ }^{(b)}$ & 51 & 55 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds $100 \\%$ because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.\n(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[b]{2}{*}{(in millions, except weighted-average data)} & \\multicolumn{4}{|r|}{Three months ended March 31,} \\\\\n  & \\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{2021} & 2020 \\\\\n  Weighted-average interest rate of loans with interest rate reductions - before TDR & & $4.57 \\%$ & & $5.20 \\%$ \\\\\n  Weighted-average interest rate of loans with interest rate reductions - after TDR & & 2.91 & & 3.48 \\\\\n  Weighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) of loans with term or payment extensions - before TDR & & 24 & & 22 \\\\\n  Weighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) of loans with term or payment extensions - after TDR & & 39 & & 39 \\\\\n  Charge-offs recognized upon permanent modification & \\$ & $-$ & \\$ & - \\\\\n  Principal deferred & & 12 & & 5 \\\\\n  Principal forgiven & & 1 & & 2 \\\\\n  Balance of loans that redefaulted within one year of permanent modification ${ }^{(a)}$ & \\$ & 24 & \\$ & 70 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.\n\nAt March 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).",

This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nLoan modifications\nCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of TDRs was $\\$ 1.2$ billion and $\\$ 954$ million as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The new TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets\nin partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\n133",

These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm's models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances.\n\nFurther, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.\n\nThe Firm's central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Assumptions at March 31, 2021} \\\\\n  & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\n  U.S. unemployment rate ${ }^{(a)}$ & $5.7 \\%$ & $4.8 \\%$ & $4.3 \\%$ \\\\\n  Cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 & $0.2 \\%$ & $2.7 \\%$ & $4.3 \\%$ \\\\\n  & \\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Assumptions at December 31, 2020} \\\\\n  & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\n  U.S. unemployment rate ${ }^{(a)}$ & $6.8 \\%$ & $5.7 \\%$ & $5.1 \\%$ \\\\\n  Cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 & $(1.9) \\%$ & $0.6 \\%$ & $2.0 \\%$ \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.",

These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm'slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.\nTax credit vehicles\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing\nmember and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\\$ 23.1$ billion and $\\$ 23.6$ billion, of which $\\$ 8.5$ billion and $\\$ 8.7$ billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021 and December 31 , 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.

The Firm has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of March 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020.",

        "text": "Mortgage servicing rights\n\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[b]{2}{*}{(in millions, except where otherwise noted)} & \\multicolumn{4}{|r|}{As of or for the three months ended March 31,} \\\\\n  & \\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{2021} & 2020 \\\\\n  Fair value at beginning of period & \\$ & 3,276 & \\$ & 4,699 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{MSR activity:} \\\\\n  Originations of MSRs & & 404 & & 271 \\\\\n  Purchase of MSRs & & 179 & & 2 \\\\\n  Disposition of MSRs ${ }^{(a)}$ & & 1 & & $(75)$ \\\\\n  Net additions/(dispositions) & & 584 & & 198 \\\\\n  Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows & & (187) & & (248) \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions:} \\\\\n  Changes due to market interest rates and other ${ }^{(b)}$ & & 836 & & $(1,370)$ \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions:} \\\\\n  Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) & & (24) & & (1) \\\\\n  Discount rates & & - & & - \\\\\n  Prepayment model changes and other ${ }^{(c)}$ & & (15) & & $(11)$ \\\\\n  Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions & & (39) & & $(12)$ \\\\\n  Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions & & 797 & & $(1,382)$ \\\\\n  Fair value at March 31, & \\$ & 4,470 & \\$ & 3,267 \\\\\n  Changes in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at March 31, & $\\$$ & 797 & \\$ & $(1,382)$ \\\\\n  Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income & & 291 & & 364 \\\\\n  Third-party mortgage loans serviced at March 31, (in billions) & & 444 & & 506 \\\\\n  Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at March 31, (in billions) ${ }^{(\\mathrm{d})}$ & & 1.8 & & 1.7 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (\"SMBS\").

The Firm's credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.",

        "text": "Note 22 - Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments\n\nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm's related accounting policies.\nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.\n\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.",

Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives.\n\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n  (in millions) & $$\\text { March 31, } 2021$$ & $$\\text { December 31, } 2020$$ \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Notional amounts} \\\\\n  Derivative guarantees \\$ & $\\$ 53,580$ & \\$ 54,415 \\\\\n  Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure & 27,782 & 27,752 \\\\\n  Maximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure & 2,805 & 2,803 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Fair value} \\\\\n  Derivative payables & 318 & 322 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs\n\nUnder the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder's favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder's issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to chargebacks.",

The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients' respective obligations under the FICC's rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote.

        "text": "Note 24 - Litigation\n\nContingencies\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\n\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $\\$ 0$ to approximately $\\$ 1.5$ billion at March 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n- the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n- the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\n- the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\n- the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\n\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\n\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.\n\nAmrapali. India's Enforcement Directorate (\"ED\") is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\"Amrapali\"). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers' petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\"PMLA\") and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\"FEMA\"). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $\\$ 25$ million held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation.\nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (\"FGN\") and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $\\$ 1.1$ billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (\"FRN\") commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $\\$ 875$ million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022.\n\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\"FX\") sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded",

        "text": "guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the tenyear disqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\n\nIn August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm's settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $\\$ 10$ million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.\n\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.\n\nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized\nan agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional \\$900 million to the approximately $\\$ 5.3$ billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court's approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\\$ 700$ million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately.\n\nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending.\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association's (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") for various currencies and the European Banking Federation's Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\"EURIBOR\"). The Swiss Competition Commission's investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. Defendants opposed that motion, which remains pending. The Firm's settlements of putative",

The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), which, collectively, resolved those agencies' respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.\n\nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\"DPA\") with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase \\& Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase \\& Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations.\n\nAcross the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase \\& Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $\\$ 920$ million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments.\n\nSeveral putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021.\n\nTwo putative class action complaints have also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the abovereferenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.\nWendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (\"Wendel\") during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France's highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation's ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan Chase's appeal of the January 2021 decision of the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.\n\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings.

Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\n\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management's best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm's legal expense was $\\$ 28$ million and \\$197 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\n\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.",

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.",

In connection with its client-driven marketmaking activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified riskmanagement activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\nPSU(s): Performance share units\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules.\nREO: Real estate owned\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.\nRetained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M\\&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nRefer to the Market Risk Management section of Management's discussion and analysis and pages 135-142 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm's management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.\n\nThe Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to \"Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\" on page 158 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nRefer to the discussion of the Firm's material legal proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase's financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase's businesses.\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global economic conditions, including:\n- significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets\n- $\\quad$ significant disruption of global supply chains, and\n- closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.\n\nA prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global economy.\n\nThe adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase's businesses and results of operations, including:\n- reduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase's clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and\n- increases in the allowance for credit losses.\n\nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments.",

Those negative effects, including the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed\nbecause of the impact of prior and potential future government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's participation directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:\n- increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny\n- negative publicity, and\n- increased exposure to litigation,\nany or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase's operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation.
