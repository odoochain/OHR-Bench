        "text": "CHAIRMAN'S REPORT\n\nIn the last report of the unincorporated Federation we commented on the significance for Victorian Co-operatives of the enactment into law of new Co-operative legislation. We also reported that action was then in hand to proceed to formal incorporation as a Federation under that Co-operation Act. The action proceeded to its logical conclusion.\nThe formation meeting was held in August 1982 attended by representatives of 32 Co -operatives. On 8th February 1983 the Registrar issued a Certificate of Incorporation bringing into being the Co-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd. On 18th April 1983 the Special Meeting, required under Rule 49, was held and the first Directors were elected.\n\nAt the 30th June 1983 the affairs of the unincorporated Federation were wound up and transferred to Co-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd, in accordance with its objects.\nIn addition to providing direct services to Members, both societies and companies, your Federation has maintained close relationship with the Minister administering the Co-operation Act the Co-operative Societies Advisory Council, the Registrar, the current Acting Registrar and Registry staff.\nWe have also worked closely with the Ministry of Employment and Training in its administration of the Employment Co-operative Development Programme by maintaining the Business Advisory Unit of the Programme within our staff in addition to overall involvement in the Programme in line with the Federation's objectives of encouraging and assisting in the formation of Co-operatives.\nWe have had discussions with the Minister of Agriculture and our Executive Officer was invited to address a meeting of senior officers of that Department.\n\nThe Council and the Board\n\nThe Council of the unincorporated Federation met on 11 occasions and the Board of the incorporated Federation met on two occasions during the year. Mr. Rigby was elected to the Council at the 1982 Annual General Meeting and to the Board in April 1983.\n\nMr . Gill resigned from the Board in June 1983 on relinquishing his qualifying Co-operative responsibility. A casual vacancy existed at 30th June 1983.\n\nFinance\n\nTo meet rising costs and developmental services the annual subscription rate was increased by $20 \\%$ for the current financial year. Increased income has been derived from services provided for the Employment Co-operative Development Programme, from the Cooperative Federation of Australia and from various other sources.\n\nDuring the year the agreement with the Co-operative Federation of Australia, whereby joint use is made of secretariat facilities and the services of the Executive Officer on a contributing cost basis, was continued. This arrangement was terminated on 30th\n\nJune 1983. The effect of this change, coupled with changed staff commitments, has requried the Board to budget for use of reserve funds in next year's developmental programme.\n\nFederation Staff\n\nAt the end of the financial year your Board was able to negotiate with Mr. Rawlinson to join the staff of the Federation on the termination of the agreement with the Co-operative Federation of Australia.\nMr. Brian Greer continued throughout the year as a member of the staff serving in the capacity as Business Adviser. Employment Co-operative Development Programme, funded by the Ministry of Employment and Training. Up to 4th June 1983 Mrs. Joanne Sarlin was employed as Administration Assistant to the Business Adviser under the Programme.\nMrs. Anne Loban also continued throughout the year as Secretary/Office Manager in the Federation's office.\n\nMembership\n\nAt the close of the year 43 Co-operatives had applied for and been issued with qualifying shares in membership of the Co-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd Of the remaining 20 members of the unincorporated Federation, 10 were unfinancial at the year end.\nDuring the year the whole Council made several courtesy exchange of information visits to Co-operatives in the Melbourne metropolitan area.\n\nCommunications\n\nDuring the year eight reports have been issued to Members following monthly meetings of the Council.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe Federation has been involved in assisting two research studies. One for a Ph.D thesis at the Australian National University as part of the Australian Bi-centennial Programme related to development of Co-operative activity in Australia. The other one is for a Master's Thesis at Melbourne University related to Co-operation in Victoria since the introduction of the first Co-operative Societies Act 1953 up to date.\nIn addition, the Federation has taken the initiative in developing a research programme related to pre-Cooperative education and curriculum development in T.A.F.E. Colleges, The research programme is being undertaken with funds provided by the Transition Programme. The research project provides for a pilot project to be undertaken in one T.A.F.E. college before the end of 1983 to enable a programme of practical co-operatives to be formed in those colleges and to be operated in conjunction with theoretical studies on the subject of co-operation in the curriculum of those colleges.\n\nMinister, Registrar, Co-operative Societies Advisory Council\n\nThe Federation's proposal for funds to be made available for production of visual education program-",

The Federation has recommended a principle of loan funds rather than grant funds should be followed.\nThe Federation's proposal for a formal evaluation of the Programme to date was accepted by the Minister. Professional consultants were engaged and the evaluation study undertaken. At the time of preparation of this report the recommendations from this study were under consideration by the Minister.\nIn addition to submitting its report on the programme as seen by the Federation a proposal has been submitted to the Minister for a re-structuring of the administration and servicing of the programme by the formation of an Employment Co-operative Development Agency.\n\nCo-operative Federation of Australia\n\nYour Federation's representatives on this national body are -\n\nMr. J. N. Black (with alternate Mr. O. J. Slattery)\nMr. B. H. Macintosh (with alternate Mr. E. I. Long)\nDuring the year discussions continued on the possibility of developing a national Federation which allowed direct membership of individual Cooperatives. Ultimately it was agreed the present structure should not be changed. The Co-operative Federation of Australia therefore continues with State Co-operative Federations as its members.\nInvestigations into the development of a Co-operative Banking institution involving agricultural and trading co-operatives, Australian Federation of Credit Unions Ltd., Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies continued into the early part of the year. However, progress along the proposed tri-partite structure was deferred latterly. Alternative structures and strategies to meet this policy of the Co-operative Federation of Australia are under study at the close of the current financial year.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Co-operative Federation is now looking to the future, to the development of effective services for members, for continued development of our relationships with Government and initiating increasing public awareness of the real value of Co-operatives in our community.\n\nWe now have our own professional staff able to assist and provide advice on matters relating to Cooperative legal, accounting, administration, financial, staff and business related matters. The further development of these services to protect and increase our locally owned Co-operative sectors is a responsibility we all share.\nWe thank all who have given loyal support over these formative years. We look forward to greatly increased involvement by Co-operatives throughout Victoria in this the only overall Co-operative representative body in the State.\n\n\nJ. NIEL BLACK \\\\ Chairman",
