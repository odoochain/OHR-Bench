        "text": "2018 Client Security Fund Annual Report An Increase In Claims\n\n\n\nClaims to the Client Security Fund are on the rise. Over the past year, the fund has received 82 claims against 22 lawyers totaling $\\$ 2,459,998$ in claimed loss. By comparison, the fund only received 48 claims in 2017 and 48 claims in 2016. This stark increase for 2018 has been driven primarily by claims against a handful of attorneys who are alleged to have converted clients' settlement funds.\n\nThe OSB Client Security Fund was established in 1967 \"to relieve or mitigate pecuniary losses to the clients of active members caused by dishonest conduct of those members in their practice of law.\" Over its lifetime, the fund has made awards in excess of $\\$ 4.5$ million to partially or fully compensate clients of lawyers. The Board of Governors has set a target of keeping a $\\$ 1$ million reserve to avoid a repeat of what occurred in 2012-2013, when the fund was completely exhausted by a spate of claims against a few defalcating lawyers.\n\nBecause the Client Security Fund is a statutorily dedicated fund, it is funded entirely by the annual CSF member assessment, interest on invested funds and money collected by subrogation from the defalcating lawyers. The fund does not receive monies from general member fees. While recoveries typically average less than $\\$ 5,000$ per year, in 2018 the fund was able to recover $\\$ 46,000$ after learning of an attorney's interest in a high value settlement. Recovery is often challenging because most lawyers responsible for claims are disbarred, deceased or otherwise without assets. Money in the fund is used only for the payment of awards and for the expenses of operating the program. In order to keep pace with the uptick in claims, effective Jan. 1, 2019, the Board of Governors approved a $\\$ 5$ increase in the fund's assessment to a total of $\\$ 15$ per member.\n\nG. Jefferson Campbell Jr.: \\$18,842\n\nThe Client Security Fund approved two claims filed by clients of G. Jefferson Campbell Jr., who resigned Form B effective July 14, 2016. In one matter, Campbell received a settlement payment and filed an interpleader action to determine whether his client's third-party creditor was entitled to the funds. The court eventually held that $\\$ 17,607$ of the settlement belonged to the client, but Campbell never reported the court's findings to his client and instead converted the funds. In the second matter, Campbell accepted a $\\$ 1,235$ retainer in a bankruptcy matter but withdrew without performing any substantial work for the client.\n\nRoger Gray: \\$2,000\n\nRoger Gray received $\\$ 2,000$ from an elderly woman who was serving as a personal representative for a deceased friend\nto assist her with administering a probate. Gray asked his client, a former paralegal, to draft forms on his behalf for use in the probate, but he never took any substantial action to represent her. He also never refunded the money. Gray resigned Form B effective July 26, 2018.\n\nE. Andrew Long: \\$3,240\n\nThe fund approved three claims from clients of E. Andrew Long. All three claims involved circumstances in which Long accepted retainers to represent clients but did not provide meaningful legal services. In one real property dispute, Long repeatedly told the client he was \"working on it\" but never took any action on the client's behalf. Long is currently suspended from the practice of law; a disciplinary board order for his disbarment is on appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court.\n\nJeffrey Milstein: \\$13,598\n\nThe committee approved four claims from clients of Jeffrey Milstein. In all four cases, Milstein accepted funds from clients for work that he did not perform. For example, in one dispute, Milstein's client was a parent who sought to challenge a Department of Human Services child abuse administrative decision. When Milstein did not provide services, the client was forced to retain new counsel despite having paid Milstein $\\$ 7,500$ for the work. Milstein ultimately resigned Form B effective Nov. 3, 2016.\n\nKenneth S. Mitchell-Phillips Sr.: \\$17,825\n\nFive clients of Kenneth S. MitchellPhillips received partial or full reimbursements from the fund. For unknown reasons, in mid-2017 Mitchell-Phillips abandoned his practice and failed to return funds belonging to clients.

Smith: \\$48,611\n\nThe fund reimbursed three clients of former Eugene attorney Robert J. Smith, who passed away on June 28, 2017. When Smith died, there were no funds in his trust account and his personal representative was unable to locate any trust account records. In the case resulting in the most significant claim, Smith had agreed to represent a client pro bono to resolve a motor vehicle accident claim.

Wilson: \\$30,608\n\nAt Matthew Wilson's request, his client lent $\\$ 30,000$ to a company in which Wilson was principal; the loan was to be secured by a deed of trust on Wilson's home. Wilson provided a defective deed that could not be recorded, which he failed to correct. He later offered to provide his client with free legal services to pay off the loan. Ultimately, Wilson did not provide any free legal services. A later disciplinary board decision found that Wilson engaged in a misrepresentation when he claimed he had sufficient equity in his home to secure the loan. The committee found that the client's loan was premised upon Wilson's attorney-client relationship with the client and reimbursed the client $\\$ 30,000$ plus $\\$ 608$ in court costs the client expended trying to recover the $\\$ 30,000$. In April 2018, Wilson was disbarred for misconduct related to the same loan.\n\nThe members of the 2018 Client Security Fund Committee are Nancy Cooper (chair), Douglas Stamm (secretary), Richard Braun, Jennifer Hisey, Carrie Hooten (public member), Rod Jones, Ann Ledgerwood, David Roy, Lucille Sage, Daniel Steinberg, Stephanie Thompson, Richard Whitlock and Raymond Young.\n\nAnyone who is interested in supporting the work of the OSB Client Security Fund should consider volunteering through the member volunteer survey, available at www.osbar.org/volunteer/ volunteeropportunities.html.\n\nEthics opinions are published and updated on the bar's website at www.osbar.org/ethics/ toc.html.\n\nAn archive of Bar Counsel columns is available online at www.osbar.org/ethics/ bulletinbarcounsel.html.",
