        "text": "Report on Corporate Governance\n\nThe Directors present the Company's Report on Corporate Governance.\n\nITC Limited has been one of the frontrunners in India to have put in place a formalised system of Corporate Governance. Its governance framework enjoins the highest standards of ethical and responsible conduct of business to create value for all stakeholders.\n\nTHE COMPANY'S GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY\n\nITC defines Corporate Governance as a systemic process by which companies are directed and controlled to enhance their wealth-generating capacity. Since large corporations employ a vast quantum of societal resources, ITC believes that the governance process should ensure that these resources are utilised in a manner that meets stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. This belief is reflected in the Company's deep commitment to contribute to the \"triple bottom line\", namely the development, nurture and regeneration of the nation's economic, social and environmental capital.\n\nITC's Corporate Governance structure, systems and processes are based on two core principles:\n(i) Management must have the executive freedom to drive the enterprise forward without undue restraints, and\n(ii) This freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of effective accountability.\n\nITC believes that any meaningful policy on Corporate Governance must empower the executive management of the Company. At the same time, Governance must create a mechanism of checks and balances to ensure that the decision-making powers vested in the executive management are used with care and responsibility to meet stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations.\n\nFrom this definition and core principles of Corporate Governance emerge the cornerstones of ITC's governance philosophy, namely trusteeship, transparency, empowerment \\& accountability, control and ethical corporate citizenship. ITC believes that the practice of\neach of these creates the right corporate culture that fulfils the true purpose of Corporate Governance.\n\nTrusteeship recognises that large corporations, which represent a coalition of interests, namely those of the shareholders, other providers of capital, business associates and employees, have both an economic and a social purpose, thereby casting the responsibility on the Board of Directors to protect and enhance shareholder value, as well as fulfil obligations to other stakeholders. Inherent in the concept of trusteeship is the responsibility to ensure equity, namely, that the rights of all shareholders, large or small, are protected.\n\nTransparency means explaining the Company's policies and actions to those to whom it has responsibilities.\nExternally, this means maximum appropriate disclosures without jeopardising the Company's strategic interests and internally, this means openness in the Company's relationship with its employees and in the conduct of its business. ITC believes transparency enhances accountability.\n\nEmpowerment is a process of unleashing creativity and innovation throughout the organisation by truly vesting decision-making powers at the most appropriate levels and as close to the scene of action as feasible, thereby helping actualise the potential of its employees.\nEmpowerment is an essential concomitant of ITC's first core principle of governance that management must have the freedom to drive the enterprise forward. ITC believes that empowerment combined with accountability provides an impetus to performance and improves effectiveness, thereby enhancing shareholder value.\n\nControl ensures that freedom of management is exercised within a framework of checks and balances and is designed to prevent misuse of power, facilitate timely management of change and ensure effective management of risks. ITC believes that control is a necessary concomitant of its second core principle of governance that the freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of appropriate checks and balances.\n\nEthical Corporate Citizenship means setting exemplary standards of ethical behaviour, both internally within the\n\n** The  cornerstones  of  ITCâ€™s  governance  philosophy  are trusteeship,  transparency,  empowerment  and  accountability, control  and  ethical  corporate  citizenship **",

ITC believes that unethical behaviour corrupts organisational culture and undermines stakeholder value. Governance processes in ITC continuously reinforce and help realise the Company's belief in ethical corporate citizenship.\n\nTHE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\nThe practice of Corporate Governance in ITC is at three interlinked levels:\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\n  Strategic supervision & by the Board of Directors \\\\\n  Strategic management & by the Corporate Management Committee \\\\\n  Executive management & by the Divisional / Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Chief Executive assisted by the respective Divisional / SBU Management Committee \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe three-tier governance structure ensures that:\n(a) Strategic supervision (on behalf of the shareholders), being free from involvement in the task of strategic management of the Company, can be conducted by the Board with objectivity, thereby sharpening accountability of management;\n(b) Strategic management of the Company, uncluttered by the day-to-day tasks of executive management, remains focused and energised; and\n(c) Executive management of a Division or Business, free from collective strategic responsibilities for ITC as a whole, focuses on enhancing the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the business.\nThe core roles of the key entities flow from this structure. The core roles, in turn, determine the core responsibilities of each entity. In order to discharge such responsibilities, each entity is empowered formally with requisite powers.\nThe structure, processes and practices of governance enable focus on the Corporate purpose while simultaneously facilitating effective management of the wider portfolio of businesses.\nThe Governance Document that sets out the structure, policies and practices of governance within the organisation is available on the Company's corporate website www.itcportal.com for general information.\n\nROLES OF VARIOUS ENTITIES\n\nBoard of Directors (Board): The primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship to protect and enhance shareholder value through strategic supervision of ITC,\nits wholly owned subsidiaries and their wholly owned subsidiaries. As trustees, the Board ensures that the Company has clear goals relating to shareholder value and its growth. The Board sets strategic goals and seeks accountability for their fulfilment. The Board also provides direction and exercises appropriate control to ensure that the Company is managed in a manner that fulfils stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. The Board, as part and parcel of its functioning, also periodically reviews its role.\n\nCorporate Management Committee (CMC): The primary role of the CMC is strategic management of the Company's businesses within Board approved direction / framework. The CMC operates under the strategic supervision and control of the Board.\n\nChairman: The Chairman of ITC is the Chief Executive of the Company. He is the Chairman of the Board and the CMC. His primary role is to provide leadership to the Board and the CMC for realising Company goals in accordance with the charter approved by the Board. He is responsible, inter alia, for the working of the Board and the CMC, for ensuring that all relevant issues are on the agenda and for ensuring that all Directors and CMC members are enabled and encouraged to play a full part in the activities of the Board and the CMC, respectively. He keeps the Board informed on all matters of importance. He is also responsible for the balance of membership of the Board, subject to Board and Shareholder approvals. He presides over General Meetings of Shareholders.\n\nDivisional Management Committee (DMC) / SBU Management Committee (SBU MC): The primary role of the DMC / SBU MC is executive management of the Divisional / SBU business to realise tactical and strategic objectives in accordance with Board approved plan.\nExecutive Director: The Executive Directors, as members of the CMC, contribute to the strategic management of the Company's businesses within Board approved direction / framework. As Directors accountable to the Board for a business / corporate function, they assume overall responsibility for its strategic management, including its governance processes and top management effectiveness.
