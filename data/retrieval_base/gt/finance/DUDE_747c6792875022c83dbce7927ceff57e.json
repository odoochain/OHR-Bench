Statement of Accounting Policies\n\na) Basis of Accounting\n\nThe Co-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd is not a reporting entity because in the Directors' opinion there are unlikely to exist users who are unable to command the preparation of reports tailored so as to satisfy specifically all their information needs, and these accounts are therefore a \"Special Purpose Financial Report\" that has been prepared solely to meet the Co-operatives Act 1996 requirements to prepare accounts.\n\nThe accounts have been prepared in accordance with the applicable Accounting Standards and other mandatory professional reporting requirements and the requirements of the Co-operatives Act 1996 with the exception that Accounting Standards AASB 1026 (Statement of Cash Flows) has not been adopted.\n\nThe accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and, therefore, do not take into account changing money values or, except where stated, the current value of monetary assets\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the previous year.\nb) Plant and Equipment\n\nPlant and equipment are included at cost. All assets are depreciated over their useful lives by the straight line method.\nc) Income Tax\n\nThe Co-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd adopts the liability method of tax-effect accounting whereby the income tax expense shown in the profit and loss account is based on the operating profit before income tax adjusted for any permanent differences.\n\nTiming differences which arise due to the different accounting periods in which items of revenue and expenses are included in the determination of operating profit before income tax and taxable income, are brought to account as either a provision for deferred income tax or an asset described as future income tax benefit at the rate of income tax applicable to the period in which the benefit will be received or the liability will become payable. Future income tax benefits relating to timing differences are not brought to account unless realisation of the asset is assured beyond reasonable doubt\nd) Stock Valuations\n\nThe Co-operative Federation of Victoria Ltd decided to revalue their stock at a more realisable value in 2004.",
