        "text": "Chairman's Message\n\nA STRONG REPUBLIC, A STRONG POWER SECTOR\n\nAstrong republic needs a strong power sector to anchor the growth and development of the nation. The passage of Republic Act No. 9136, which served as the economic blueprint for the restructuring of the electric power industry, was envisioned to provide a solid base for the introduction of the much needed reforms in the power sector.\n\nWhile the implementation of this law requires the concerted efforts of all industry stakeholders, ERC plays the most pivotal role in realizing its success.\n\nDuring the transition phase of the reform process, the Regulatory Body laid the groundworks for the electric industry restructuring. For one, in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions, the Regulator has promulgated certain rules and regulations, guidelines and procedures which are vital to the restructuring of the power\n sector.\n\nWhile performing its rule-making function, the Commission is also mandated to hear cases involving unbundling of rates or otherwise, in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function. In this respect, the Commission conducted an average of 3 to 4 hearings a day for year 2002.\n\nOn top of these functions, ERC is likewise tasked to enforce its orders and decisions, monitor their compliance, and accordingly impose the corresponding punitive sanctions in the exercise of its administrative enforcement function.\n\nConsidering the enormity of the work of the Regulator and the statutorily prescribed timelines that it has to meet, the greatest challenge it has continuously grappled with is balancing the interests of the consumers and the utility investors.\n\nIn issuing its Decisions on the rates unbundling of NPC Main, NPC-Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG) and four (4) electric cooperatives for the year 2002, ERC modified some of the previous rulings of its predecessor agencies by setting new key regulatory policies to further the promotion of public interest.\n\nCalendar Year 2002 was indeed a year of moulding and re-shaping the regulatory environment that is responsive to the needs of the electric power industry. This task of the Regulatory Commission is not yet done though. In the next two years, the foundations of the industry restructuring will continuously be built, until such time that the electricity market is ready, and retail competition and open access shall have already taken place.\n\nThe years ahead will definitely be full of challenges, and we are counting on the electricity stakeholders to do their share in meeting these challenges head-on.\n\n\n27 December 2002",

        "text": "HIGHLIGHTS OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR CALENDAR YEAR (CY) 2002\n\n\nThe major accomplishments of the ERC for the year 2002 focused primarily on the unbundling of rates, hearing of cases and rendering of decisions, promotion of consumer interests, and the promulgation of rules, regulations, guidelines, and procedures that are vital to the restructuring of the Philippine electric power industry pursuant to R.A. No. 9136.\n\n1. UNBUNDLING OF RATES\n\nFor National Power Corporation (NPC) and each distribution utility, the ERC prescribed a format for the Uniform Filing Requirements (UFR) to separate the costs related to the functions of Generation, Transmission, Distribution, and Supply and to present the relevant issues that affect their rates. Year 2000 data were used in accordance with the law being the most current audited full year available at filing time.\n\nDecisions:\n- National Power Corporation (Main) - With updated fuel and purchased power costs using the June 2002 billing month, NPC's rate in Luzon was increased by PhP 0.0956/kWh and reduced in Visayas and Mindanao by PhP 0.5170/kWh and PhP $0.4769 / \\mathrm{kWh}$, respectively.\n- National Power Corporation-Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG) was granted a Provisional Authority (PA) to implement the unbundling of rates in the SmallIsland Grids. With updated FCA and FOREX based on the October 2002 level, NPC's effective rate was reduced by PhP 0.1084/kWh for Luzon, PhP 0.2719/kWh for Visayas and PhP 0.1922/kWh for Mindanao which accounts for the deferred FCA.\n- Applications of the following distribution utilities resulted in an overall rate reduction primarily due to the decrease in power cost purchased from NPC:\n- Pampanga I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (PELCO I)\n- Pangasinan I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (PANELCO I)\n\nFormer Senator Juan Ponce Enrile attended the public hearing in ERC as witness of the oppositor on the hearing of MERALCO's unbundling petition.",

Other rate base amounts disallowed include the accumulated amortization of electric plant under capital lease and a portion of the cash working capital.\n- Items included as additions to the rate base by the Commission are: (a) Materials and Supplies and (b) Construction Work in Progress. Materials and supplies are necessary to the provision of reliable electricity service even if not physically in service. This is so because without immediate access to equipment held in inventory, an electric utility may have to wait for an unacceptable period of time for delivery of the assets necessary to correct an outage. Construction Work in Progress is a continuous process for NPC and was included so as not to discourage reasonable and necessary investment.\n\n- Expenses disallowed by the Commission amounted to more than P8 billion primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization, and purchased power. Depreciation expense based on revalued assets was disallowed because it allowed said utility to recoup or amortize more than its original price investment. This effectively forced the customers to finance the increment between original and replacement cost. Such being the case, investors should only be allowed depreciation expense based on original cost.\n\n\nThe Commission adopted the \"used and useful\" standard in allowing or disallowing plants and assets in NPC's rate base.",

Electric coops are allowed to recover only up to $14 \\%$ system loss and up to 1\\% for company use. The Commission emphasized, however, that company use should not include the personal consumption of its Board of Directors, officers and staff.\n\n\nThe restructuring of the electric power industry would call for the setting of new regulatory policies that are responsive to the needs of said industry.\n\n- Payroll\n\nAdoption of the policy of adjusting the payroll account to current salary levels of permanent employees if justifiable, even if the basis for other costs was year 2000.\n\nRemoval of the Wage Adjustment Clause (WAC) Formula authorized by the then Energy Regulatory Board through ERB Case Nos. 94-25 and 94-96.

Both unbundling and consumer complaint cases translate to $80 \\%$ of the cases heard. The rest accounts for the remaining 20\\% (refer to table 2).\n\nOut of the twenty-eight (28) cases decided, five (5) were on the application of unbundling of electricity rates by electric utilities (NPC- Main, PELCO I, PANELCO I, SORECO I, and ZAMSURECO II) filed in compliance with Section 36 of R.A. 9136. In the case of the application for rate unbundling of NPC-SPUG, the Commission issued a Provisional Authority (PA); hence an Order, not a Decision was issued.\n\nFive (5) cases involved a petition for a rate increase. The Provisional Authority previously issued to Lanao del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (LANECO) and Negros Occidental Electric Cooperative, Inc. (NOCECO) were made permanent. The rate of the Don Orestes Romualdez Electric Cooperative, Inc. was, however, maintained to its existing level. In addition, a Provisional Authority was issued to Sorsogon II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SORECO II) and Tarlac I Electric Cooperative, Inc.

Moreover, separate CPCNs were issued to the said utility for its operation of electric service in Obando and Sta.

A fine was imposed on two violations to Section 8 \\& 16 of ERB Resolution No. 95-21. The third case, a violation of Section 16 of ERB Resolution No. 95-21, was dismissed after noting that the utility firm only failed to report the corrective action to make its distribution equipment and facilities in Maragondon and Magallanes, Cavite complying to standards set forth in the above cited resolution.
