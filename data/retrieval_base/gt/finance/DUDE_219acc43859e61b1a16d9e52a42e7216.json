Since the last Report 157 new Members have been elected, namely, 151 Ordinary (of whom 19 have paid their life compositions), 1 Honorary, and 5 Honorary Corresponding. But during the year the Society has lost 81 Fellows, five of whom were Honorary Corresponding: 57 have been lost by death, 22 by resignation, and 2 have been removed by order of the Council. The total number on the list at the end of April was 2089 Ordinary, 5 Honorary, and 63 Honorary Corresponding Members. At the same date last year the number of Ordinary Members was 1997, and in the previous year (1864) 1907.\n\nFinances.-The Balance-sheet (Appendix A) shows that the receipts (exclusive of balance in hand) exceeded the estimate by the sum of $302 l .18 s .3 d$. , and that the expenditure has fallen short of the estimated amount by 305 l .15 s .7 d . In consequence of these favourable results, the Council have been enabled to add 10001. India 5 per Cents. to the funded property, notwithstanding the large sum of $800 l$. spent in expeditions; but the anticipated balance",

The expenditure in 1865 was 4307l. 4s. 5d., and in 1864 3647 l .7 s .10 d . The increase in the expenditure last year is accounted for by the large sum spent in the promotion of expeditions.\n\nThe funded property of the Society now amounts to 13,500 ., 11,500l. of which are invested in New 3 per Cents. and 2000l. in India 5 per Cents. ; 1000l. have been added since December 31, 1865 , the end of the financial year. This sum exceeds by 5001 . the total amount of life compositions of living compounders, the number of whom on the 30th of April last was 520. In 1864, as may be seen in the Council Report of that year, the reserved Fund fell short of the life compositions by nearly 2000l., notwithstanding the great improvement effected during the same year. The sound condition which the monetary affairs of the Society have now attained is due chiefly to the vigilance of the Finance Committee throughout the last three years.\n\nA legacy of 4000 . has been bequeathed to the Society by one of its members, the late Benjamin Oliveira, Esq. The bequest formed one of several left to various institutions, and the personal estate of the testator not sufficing to pay the whole in full, the executors filed a bill in Chancery with a view to the equitable apportionment of the assets. The solicitors to the executors having selected, from the number of legatees, the Royal Geographical Society to defend the suit, the Council were recommended by their legal advisers to appear in it, and they are now informed that there is good prospect of an early and favourable adjudication.\n\nThe system of monthly examination of the accounts by the Finance Committee, established in 1864, has been continued throughout the year, and all bills due by the Society are paid at the next monthly meeting following their presentation. As will be seen in the Balance-sheet (Appendix A), the accounts have been audited to the end of the year 1865 ; they have also been examined to the end of April in the present year.",

IV., of the Regulations, which requires the removal from the list of Fellows of all those who are defaulters for three years be put in force against those who shall not have paid their arrears by the 1st of August next.",

They have, therefore, to submit to the Meeting a new Clause, proposed to be added to Chap. II. of the Regulations, which, if approved of, will empower them to remit the usual payments in these cases.\n\nPublications.-The Council have great satisfaction in announcing that the volume of the Journal has this year been issued at a much earlier date than has been the case for many years past, having been published on the 9th of April. It comprises an average number of important memoirs, and the attention of Fellows is especially directed to the valuable series of original Maps that it contains, some of which have been compiled after much research and at considerable cost.\n\nThe 9th volume of Proceedings has also been completed and delivered to the Members since the last anniversary, and three parts of the 10 th volume, containing the Reports of the Meetings of the present Session down to the 12th of March, have been issued.\n\nThe Council have again the pleasure of reporting an increase in the sale of publications during the past year, the amount being 124l. $4 s .4 d$. In the year 1864 the total sales were 105l. 12 s . $7 d$., and in 1863 65l. 8s. $8 d$.\n\nLibrary.-406 volumes of Geographical and other works have been added to the Library since the last Report, 39 of which were purchased.\n\nThe re-arrangement of the Library undertaken on the completion of the Catalogue last year is nearly finished, and greater facilities are now afforded to those Members who wish to make use",

Chandless, Esq., m.a.\n\nLarge Diagrams.-A Special Committee of Council, consisting of Vice-Admiral Sir George Back, Rear-Admiral R. Collinson, and Major-General G. Balfour, has been engaged during the present Session in directing the construction of large Diagrams for the illustration of Papers at the evening Meetings, and to complete the series of which the Society's large Maps of Africa and Australia form part. Four of these Diagrams have been determined upon; -namely, Asia, the Malay Archipelago, South America, and the World on Mercator's projection; and great pains are being taken to ensure correctness by consulting personally some of the best living authorities on the various countries. It is hoped that the Diagram of Asia will be ready at the commencement of the next Session.\n\nThe Committee has also taken steps to ensure the completion of a Catalogue of the Maps in the Society's collection, and has obtained the sanction of Council to the appointment of an extra Assistant to aid in its compilation. At the next anniversary the Council hope to be able to report the termination of this work, which will give additional facilities to the consultation of the great stores of Maps now in the Society's possession.\n\nGrants to Travellers.-The sum of 800l. 8s. 3d. was expended, during the year 1865, in grants made to promote new explorations.
