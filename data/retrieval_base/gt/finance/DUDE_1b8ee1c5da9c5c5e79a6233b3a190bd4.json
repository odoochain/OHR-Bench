Before we delve into the analysis of a robust Indian economy. the daunting task of delivering performance in an industry not just restricted by compulsory licensing and discriminatory taxation but also regulations in conducting day-to-day business activities, we would like to bring to your notice the purposefu meaning of success to your company\nIt is not uncommon for successful companies to realize the need to claim to be responsible companies. However, whilst being in a restricted category, socia responsibility is as integral to success as growth and profits.\nGodfrey Phillips India Limited and its entire team is committed to conduct its business in a responsible manner: for example we provide information to our trade partners\nthat they should not sell to people who are below 18 years of age. trade informatio and boards are provided and is ensured that these are kept at prominent places to name a few.\nOther than seeing profits as a reward to shareholders and employees we also see how we can be instrumental in benefiting the society and environment we operate in Uncommon and uniquue initiatives like Godfrey Phillips WHITE a responsible smokers programme and Godrrey Philips Bravery- an initiative that promotes selfless courage\nand bravery are some of the major opportunities for us to put our belief int o pratice.\n\nGENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nIndia is pacing towards realizing its role as the third largest economy in the world by 2016. By 2025 India will be about $60 \\%$ of the US economy. The transformation of the Word economy into a tri-polar economy will be complete by 2035 . These projections\nalong with a consitent delivery on GDP growth rate are fuelling imagination of the along with a consistent delivery on GD\nsecond largest population group on earth.\nIndian economy has attained robustness. National income statistics released by the year of good performance $G D$ grew by $8.4 \\%$, backed by strong growth in agsicultur of $3.9 \\%$, industrial growth of $9 \\%$ and a $10 \\%$ growth in the services sector. For the last three years, annual growth in GDP averaged around $8 \\%$\nThe economic growth, though well distributed, can be largely attributed to the growth in the services sector. The share of services sector to GDP has grown from $49 \\%$ in 2000 to $54 \\%$ in 2006 . The share of agriculture has receded from $28 \\%$ in 2000 to 22 in 2006. The manufacturing sector has maintained its share with justa 0.8 percentage\n\nTOBACCO/CIGARETE INDUSTRY IN INDIA\nCigarette industry in India and its potential\nTaxation\nThe Indian Cigarette industry is heavily taxed and operates under draconia regulatory condititons. Cigareteses whicin account for onl $14 \\%$ of the total tobacco consumption, contribute over $90 \\%$ lapprox. S. 8.8000 crore) of the total excise revenue\nfrom tobacco. This is a result of inequitable taxation on Cigaretes which is 34 times higher than other tobacco products. The current regulatory and taxation framework on cigarettes, does not take into account the uniqueness of Indian tobacco industry\nwhich is extremely fragmented In India, $86 \\%$ tobacco consumption comprises of bidi Which is extremely fragmented. In India, $86 \\%$ tobacco consumption compprises of bid\nand chewing tobacco, with over $60 \\%$ consumers having dual usage patterns i.e, the consume cigarettes and other forms of tobacco as well. Even a slight increase in price of cigarettes shifts the demand to cheaper, and revenue ineficient forms of tobacco like bidi, cheaper cigarette (that evade excise duty) and chewing tobacco.\nThe Cigarette industry has once again been singled out and levied with an excise increase of $5 \\%$. This increase comes on the back of a $10 \\%$ increase in the cigarette\nexcise in the last Budget. II addition, some states leyy entry tax, octroi and other local excise in the last Budget. In addition, some states levy entry tax, octroi and other loca leves. Alf tese put an adaditional burden to arready heavily taxed cigarette industry,\nwhich has been struggling in highly challenging regulatory environment. Also, exclusion of beedis and chewing tobacco from this leyy is inequitous and discriminatory: this not only defeeats the social objective of tobacco control but als\nieopardise revenue collection, farmers' earnings and export collection.\n\n\\section*{Marketing Regulation}\n\nThe Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act 2003\n(COTPA), read with the notifictions issued thereunder imposed advertising ban on all Tobacco products, prohibition on sale to minors and in the vicinity of educational institutions, prohibits smoking in public places.\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, your company ensures that its business is\nconducted in compliance with the provisions of coTPA.\n\n\\section*{Creating earning opportunities for farmers}\n\nAlign Tobacco production pattern to meet International demand\n\nIndia is the world's third largest mere 30, share of the US5 52 billion global tobacco leaz export trade.

A growth in FCV tobacco expoots would incentivise fermers to grow better quality/varieties of tobacco. However, India's exports are being impeded by the lack of a strong domestic base, as two thirds of tobacco production continues to comprise of varieteses that have virtually no export potential. In this In the early yous, Brazil's lear exexports were at par with India However. over the next three decades, their exports have leapfrogged and are now six times that of India.\n\n\\section*{Wdening the tax base}\n\n<chart>\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nCountry & Cigarette Consumption (\\%) \\\\\n\\hline\nChina & 96 \\\\\n\\hline\nUSA & 84 \\\\\n\\hline\nPakistan & 58 \\\\\n\\hline\nNepal & 49 \\\\\n\\hline\nIndia & 14 \\\\\n\\hline\nWorld & 90 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n</chart>\n\n\nCigarettes contribute over Rs. 8000 crore in excise, which accounts for more than $85 \\%$ of the total excise revenue generated by tobacco products. $A$ comparison in the global per capita consumption scenario puts India as second lowest. These figures create a\nmisleading picture because even as cigarette consumption has declined from $23 \\%$ in 1971- 72 to 14\\%, total tobacco consumption has gone up from 406 million kgs in $1981-82$ to 500 million kgs in $2004-05$. This decline has undoubtedly resulted in a potential revenue loss to the exchequer.\nThis can be attributed to the inequity in the Government's tobacco tax policies.
