Hopefully, you will find the information contained herein to be useful in helping you decide which, if any, of the costs of the association you should approve for inclusion in utility rates. Often, such costs directly incurred by the state's utilities are reviewed by state commissioners in accordance with their policies for treatment of such costs.\n\nSeveral expense categories in the report may be viewed by some state commissions as potential vehicles for charging ratepayers with such costs as lobbying, advocacy or promotional activities, which may not be considered by some commissioners to be to the benefit of state ratepayers. In the opinion of some state commissions, the possible exceptions to that view may be expenses directly related to research and development relevant to utility operations, and a proportional amount of associated administrative overhead expense.\n\nEEI requested, and the NARUC Committee approved, modification of its Schedule of Contributions \\& Club Dues (see pages III 7-10 of the EEI report) by combining all contributions, both political and other, into one column, which is consistent with how the AGA and the USTA report these expenditures.\n\nThe Committee and its staff have reviewed the EEI Annual Audit Report for 1997. In addition, staff members met with EEI financial officials, tested the association's expenses on a random basis to determine if they were charged to the proper categories, and discussed with EEI officials any items which appeared to require further explanation. Staff is satisfied that the EEI Annual Audit Report for 1997 fairly presents the expenditures of EEI in the manner prescribed by NARUC.\n\nIf you have further questions about the above responses, or questions about other expenses in the EEI annual audit report, please let me know and the",
