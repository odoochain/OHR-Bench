While an enterprise can be classified as a small business based upon its number of employees, its annual income or both, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and this report primarily define a small business as one with fewer than 500 employees. ${ }^{1}$\n\nOver the last five years for which data are available, employment at New York's small businesses rose by 9.2 percent, slightly faster than the national pace, as shown in Figure 1. Total payroll showed strong growth, rising to $\\$ 212.6$ billion in New York, and the number of firms rose both in the State and nationally. ${ }^{2}$\n\n\\section*{Firms and Employment}\n\nAmong the more than 465,000 businesses in New York in 2016, 99 percent were small businesses. In addition, the State was home to over 1.7 million non-employer businesses, which largely comprise selfemployed individuals. ${ }^{3}$\n\nOf the small businesses with paid employees in 2016, almost two-thirds had fewer than five employees, with over 81 percent having fewer than 10 employees, as shown in Figure 2. These 374,000 microbusinesses provided over 957,000 jobs with total payroll close to $\\$ 43$ billion. ${ }^{4}$\n\nFIGURE 1\nSmall Business Growth, U.S. and New York, 2011-2016\n\n<chart>\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c}\n & New York & United States \\\\ \\hline\nFirms & 4 & 5 \\\\\nEmployment & 9 & 9 \\\\\nPayroll & 17 & 21 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n</chart>\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nFIGURE 2\nBusinesses by Firm Size, New York, 2016\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n\n\\footnotetext{\n1 The SBA uses various standards for determining small business status based on numbers of employees, ranging from 50 to 1,500 depending on industry sector. In New York, Section 131 of the Economic Development Law defines a small business as one that has fewer than 100 employees and is independently owned and operated.\n2 Data for this report is drawn primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Businesses (latest annual data 2016).\n3 As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, a non-employer business is one that has no paid employees, has annual business receipts in excess of $\\$ 1,000$, and is subject to federal income taxes. The information and data in this report do not encompass non-employer businesses.\n4 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines microbusinesses as those with fewer than 10 employees.\n}",

        "text": "New York State and Small Businesses\n\nThe Office of the State Comptroller invests in New York's small businesses through the New York State Common Retirement Fund (CRF). Through its In-State Private Equity Program, the CRF has committed $\\$ 1.8$ billion to private equity investment in New York as of February 28, 2019. Some $\\$ 1.2$ billion has been invested in 406 companies, putting public pension fund dollars to work in startup, emerging and established businesses in every region of the State, with a concentration of investments in New York's burgeoning high-tech sector. ${ }^{6}$\n\nThe CRF's lending partnership with the New York Business Development Corporation (NYBDC) provides capital for small business loans throughout the State. As of March 31, 2018, 1,139 loans totaling $\\$ 393$ million had been made through NYBDC to companies providing a total of more than 23,000 jobs. Historically, about 40 percent of NYBDC loans funded with CRF investments have been for Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs). In 2017, 46 percent were for MWBEs.\n\nThrough its In-State Private Equity Program, the New York State Common Retirement Fund has committed $\\$ 1.8$ billion to private equity investment in New York.\n\nConclusion\n\nSmall businesses are an important part of every industry sector in the State, from construction and manufacturing to educational services and high technology. Smaller companies face a variety of challenges in a continually changing marketplace, including access to capital, hiring and retaining skilled employees, rising expenses, and the competitive demands of an increasingly global economy. Providing many good paying jobs and nearly half of all private employment, small businesses drive economic growth and contribute to the quality of life in communities across New York and the nation.\n\n6 Information on the Office of the State Comptroller's In-State Private Equity Program is available at http://www.osc.state.ny.us/ pension/instate/index.htm.\n\nLike us on Facebook at facebook.com/nyscomptroller Follow us on Twitter @nyscomptroller",
