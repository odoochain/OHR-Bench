MPSERS Normal Cost Offset. Governor moved the $\\$ 669,000$ one-time FY19 item for this purpose to an ongoing appropriation and increased the amount by an additional $\\$ 565,000$ for a total normal cost offset of $\\$ 1.2$ million for the seven universities that are part of MPSERS. This amount will support the additional costs associated with brining the assumed rate of return for MPSERS funds from $8 \\%$ to $7.05 \\%$. House and Senate concurred with the Governor's changes.\n3. MPSERS Unfunded Accrued Liability Stabilization Adjustment. Governor reduced this item to reflect a reduction in the amount of the State's share of costs above the statutory cap. This reduction would bring total MPSERS UAAL payments to $\\$ 5.0$ million. House and Senate concurred with the Governor.\n4. Children of Veterans Tuition Grant - Supplant Income Tax Checkoff. Governor replaced \\$100,000 in income tax checkoff revenue with GF/GP as this item no longer appears on tax forms. Total appropriations for this program would remain unchanged at $\\$ 1.4$ million.

        "text": "Boilerplate Changes from FY 2018-19 Year-to-Date:\n\nItems Included by the Senate and House\n1. Receipt of Federal and Private Funds. Specifies that Federal and private funds received by the State for use of a college or university are appropriated for the purposes for which they are received. Governor removed a sentence that specifies that the acceptance of funds does not obligate the Legislature to continue the purposes for which the funds are made available. House, Senate, and Conference retained existing language. (Sec. 242)\n2. Tuition Incentive Program - Limit Payment Size. Governor included new language that would limit payments made to universities under this program to a per-credit payment that does not exceed three times the average community college in-district tuition rate. House, Senate, and Conference did not include this new language. (Sec. 256)\n3. U of M Douglas Lake Biological Station. Governor removed a section that designates Douglas Lake a special reserve and states the intent of the Legislature that no State programs or policies be developed that would have a deleterious impact on the research value of Douglas Lake. House, Senate, and Conference retained this section. (Sec. 261)\n4. Discouraged Instruction Activity. Governor removed a section stating the intent of the Legislature that public universities not use State funds to offer instructional activities that target companies or groups of companies for unionization or decertification of a union. House, Senate, and Conference retained this section. (Sec. 271a)\n5. Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. Governor removed a section stating the intent of the Legislature that public and private organizations stem cell research provide certain information to the director of the Department of Health and Human Services. House, Senate, and Conference retained this section. (Sec. 274)\n6. Use and Finance Noncompliance Penalty.

Governor reduced the allowable tuition increase under this section from $3.8 \\%$ or $\\$ 490$ to $3.2 \\%$ or $\\$ 427$. This change reflects a new policy of setting the tuition restraint cap at the rate of inflation plus $1.0 \\%$, whereas the policy in previous years had been twice the rate of inflation. House concurred with the Governor. Senate and Conference maintained the current policy, which resulted in a tuition cap of 4.4\\% or \\$587. (Sec. 265)\n12. Tuition Restraint - Exceeding Limit.

The fourth column is the most recent data on the cost for each university to provide waivers to students who qualify for the ITW. In FY 1996-97, the Legislature rolled separately-identified ITW amounts for each university into that university's operations line item. Each year, this amount has been tracked and adjusted for across-the-board increases or decreases in university operating appropriations; this amount is shown in the second column. The third column is the amount that must be added to the amount already built in to each university's operations appropriation to produce the number in the fourth column.",
