HCFA is responsible for the Medicare program, Federal participation in the Medicaid program, the Professional Standards Review Organization program, and a variety of other health care quality assurance programs.\n\nThe mission of the Health Care Financing Administration is to promote the timely delivery of appropriate, quality health care to its beneficiaries - approximately 47 million of the nation's aged, disabled, and poor. The Agency must also ensure that program beneficiaries are aware of the services for which they are eligible, that those services are accessible and of high quality, and that Agency policies and actions promote efficiency and quality within the total health care delivery system.\n\nHCFA's Office of Research, Demonstrations, and Statistics (ORDS) conducts studies and projects that demonstrate and evaluate optional reimbursement, coverage, eligibility, and management alternatives to the present Federal programs. ORDS also assesses the impact of HCFA programs on health care costs, program expenditures, beneficiary access to services, hea!th care providers, and the health care industry. In addition, ORDS monitors national health care expenditures and prices and provides actuarial analyses on the costs of current HCFA programs as well as the impact of possible legislative or administrative changes in the programs.\n\nThe purpose of the Health Care Financing Notes is to provide the public with descriptive program data or information as soon as it becomes available. Data are presented here in a brief, concise format. Frequently a more comprehensive analysis of the data may be available at a later time in one of the Health Care Financing Administration's other publications.",

Figures are shown separately for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, independent laboratories, outpatient physical therapy and portable x-ray services. The accompanying tables show: (1) the five year trends in the number of providers and suppliers of services participating in the Medicare program between July 1975 and July 1979 (Table 1); and (2) State data on the number of participating providers and suppliers of services as of July 1979 (Tables 2 and 3).\n\nComputer software services were provided by Charles Helbing, Vikki Latta, Betty Gunn and Cheryl Black. Significant contributions to the report were made by Herbert A. Silverman, Chief, Program Statistics Branch; and Allen Dobson, Director, Division of Beneficiary Studies. This report is one of a series prepared in The Office of Research, Judith Lave, Director, to provide a description and analysis of the use and cost of the health care benefits furnished to the beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the Health Care Financing Administration.\n' For the statutory definition of providers and suppliers of services and the detailed conditions for participation under Medicare, see Medicare Program Regulatlons, 42 CFR, Part 405, Subpart S, Health Care Financing Administration.\n\nTrends in Participation, July 1975-July 1979\n- Between July 1975 and July 1979, the number of participating short-stay hospitals increased from 6,107 to 6,128 , a net increase of 21 .

The average number of beds per psychiatric hospital decreased from 516 to 321.\n- Relatively large increases occurred in the number of skllled nursing facilities (SNF's) and the total number of SNF beds. The number of SNF's increased 26 percent, from 3,932 to 4,963 . The number of SNF beds increased 46 percent, from about 287,500 to about 420,000. The average number of beds per SNF increased from 73 to 85.\n- The ratio of short-stay hospital beds to SNF beds dropped from 3.1 to 1 in 1975 to 2.3 to 1 in 1979.\n- The number of home health agencies increased by 24 percent between 1975 and 1979, from 2,242 to 2,788.",
