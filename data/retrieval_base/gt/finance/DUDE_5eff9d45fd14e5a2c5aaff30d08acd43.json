DIRECTORS\n\n(i) The Board\n\nThe businesses of the Company and the Group are managed by the Board of Directors, which meets regularly to ensure that the Group is properly managed to achieve improvement in the expected long-term shareholders value.\n\nThe Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for making broad policy decisions, including the approval of annual and interim results, annual business plans and budgets, significant acquisitions and disposals, material agreements, major capital expenditures and senior executive appointments.

Hence, a nomination committee is currently not required.\n\n(v) Re-election\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association provide that at every annual general meeting of the Company, one-third of the Directors shall retire from office and that all Directors shall retire from office once at least in each three years, but shall be eligible for re-election. The Directors to retire in each year are the Directors who have been longest in office since their last election.\n\nNon-Executive Directors are not appointed for a specific term and are subject to re-election by shareholders at the next annual general meeting following their appointment, or to re-election in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nDirectors who are due for re-election at the forthcoming Thirty-Seventh Annual General Meeting are Encik Azman bin Badrillah and Mr Seow Thiam Fatt.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION\n\nThe Board is of the view that remuneration guidelines for Directors, formulated by drawing upon the wealth of experience of all the Directors on the Board, would be more effective, and therefore, a remuneration committee is currently not required.

The remuneration policy of the Group seeks to attract and retain as well as to motivate employees of all levels to contribute positively to the Group's performance.\n\nThe guidelines on bonuses in respect of 2008 and annual increment for 2009 in respect of executive employees of the Group were recommended for Board's approval by committees whose members included senior heads of operations below the Board level. The quantum of the annual performance bonus was dependent on the operating results of the Group after taking into account the prevailing business conditions. The same guidelines were also applied to the Executive Directors.\n\nThe remuneration of each of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole within the limits fixed by the shareholders of the Company at an amount not exceeding, in aggregate, RM300,000.
