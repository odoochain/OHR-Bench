Two issues namely imposition of Value Added Tax (VAT) and Graphic Health Warnings (GHW) on cigarette packets dominated the year and made the markets remain in a turbulent state.\n\nIndustry Issues\n\nOn 1 st April, 2007, VAT on cigarettes was imposed for the first time in most markets where your Company operates. VAT being ad valorem in nature, is imposed on the invoice price and had an impact of $12.5 \\%$ in the price to the consumer. This coupled with an\nincrease of $6 \\%$ (inclusive of cess) in Excise Duties in the Union Budget 2007 resulted in increase of cigarette prices by more than $22 \\%$. It was expected that the industry would shrink in the current year as this rise was unprecedented in the cigarette industry. GHW has been the other issue which remained in news throughout the year. Originally scheduled for implementation during February, 2007, it was postponed a number of times during the year and the current revised date is June 2008. This uncertainty of the GHW being implemented resulted in creating uncertain market conditions through the year.\n\nSEGMENT WISE PERFORMANCE\n\nYour Company considers tobacco and related products as the primary segment\nfor reporting. Geographical segments considered for disclosure mainly consist of sales within India and sales outside India. The entire activity pertaining to sales outside India is carried out from India.\n\nMarket Scenario\n\nIn spite of the twin challenges mentioned above, your Company was able to grow volumes by $1 \\%$ during the current financial year. More heartening, was the change in mix with filters share improving substantially. The value for money filter brand \"Moments\" was launched during the last quarter of the year 2006-07 and continues to show promise. It is also pertinent to add that brands launched during the last five years, namely Special Extra Smooth, Moments, Shaan, etc. have continued to show great promise and currently their share in the total volume is around $\\mathbf{2 0 \\%}$.\n\nThe improved economic conditions as well as your Company's strategic thrust in concentrating on the tobacco business, have helped your Company to continue on the growth path despite great adversities.\nThe current Union Budget 2008-09 has dealt yet another unprecedented blow to the cigarette industry as a whole and has much more significant adverse effect on your Company in particular. The excise duty for non-filter cigarettes has been increased by two and a half times to five times, a selective increase not seen in the history of the cigarette industry. Upto length of 60 mm brands the duty has been increased from Rs. 168 per 1000 cigarettes to Rs. 819 per 1000 cigarettes, nearly 5 times. For cigarettes between 60 mm to 70 mm , the excise duty has been increased from",

        "text": "Rs. 546 per 1000 cigarettes to Rs. 1323 per 1000 cigarettes, an increase of nearly two and a half\ntimes. On the other hand, Excise Duty rates for the entire filter segment, accounting for 70\\% of industry volume remain unchanged.\n\nYou are aware these two plain segments constitute around $55 \\%$ of your Company's market and such record increases can only create significant competitive disadvantages for us in the market place. As this move by the Government is selectively punitive, representations have been made to the Finance Ministry in New Delhi and also been taken up by the industry to moderate duty increases. Nevertheless, your Company has responded to such challenges in the past and is confident that it will overcome the current crises. For the industry however, this translates to impact of $30 \\%$ on volumes and it would be fair to estimate that there would be substantial reduction in volumes in these two segments, as to render them virtually insignificant.\n\nDuring the year under review the cigarette volumes grew from 8653 mns in 2006-07 to 8823 mns in 2007-08. The value realizations were also higher at Rs. 709.94 crore up from Rs. 674.98 crore in the previous year.\n\nLeaf Tobacco\n\nWe are happy to report that your Company has recorded Rs.59.55 crore leaf export turnover, which is $32 \\%$ higher than the year 2006-07, despite severe competition and rupee appreciation.\n\nYour Company has established special tobaccos for niche markets, which are being produced by the large farmer base of your Company. This has helped in optimising the turnover and\nprofit and also helped in economic uplift of the backward regions. Your Company had entered into long term $(10$ years) tie-ups with potential customers for Oriental Tobacco development and marketing. We are now in the second year of commercial operations, and we look forward to $13 \\%$ export growth for next three years. We have established markets with premium customers for Air cured Burley exports and Fire cured tobaccos and this will also ensure steady export growth in the years to come. Your Company continues to retain the premier status in Sun/Air/Fire cured tobaccos. There is however increased incidence of freelancers getting into development areas due to spurt in demand for Sun/Air/Fire cured tobaccos.\n\nYou will be pleased to learn that your Company's farmers continue to grow tobacco with lowest pesticide residue levels and well within international standards.\n\nAs a social responsibility to conserve greenery, your Company is continuing social forestry through afforestation and Trees for Life and also actively discouraging child labour involvement in tobacco growing/processing. Leaf function has been recommended for SA 8000 Certification by Registro Italiano Navale India (RINA).\n\nPRODUCTION AND PLANT MODERNISATION\n\nPrimary Manufacturing Department (PMD)\n\nCut lamina conditioning tunnel has been installed in Lamina Cutting Line to ensure improved expansion and filling power.\n\nStem flattener has been installed in Stem Cutting Line to ensure better and consistent quality stem cutting.\n\nOn line moisture meter at drier entry and new design weigh feeders have been installed in Lamina Drying Line to achieve accurate moisture control.\n\nTobacco rejection in the processing lines has reduced by $0.86 \\%$ over the last year.\n\nSecondary Manufacturing Department (SMD)\n\nThe following technology has been put in place in accordance with ongoing modernisation plan of Secondary Manufacturing Department, to improve productivity and quality -\n- One Molins MK9 MTF 5500 cpm Making machine has been installed\n- Direct transportation of CFCs from SMD Packing lines to the warehouse on the Plains line\n- One GD HRC (Half Round Corner) packer with S90 Cig Reservoir \\& GD wrapper along with the Parceller has been installed. HRC Capacity increased by $100 \\mathrm{Mnc} /$ month\n- One GD 121-12000 Filter making Machine along with Filter Shooter installed\n\nHUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT\n\nYour Company's Human Resource Management focus continues to be in making available a talent pool, for meeting challenges in the competitive market place.\n\nDevelopment plans have been drawn up for key managers for job enrichment, as well as to increase effectiveness.\n\nAs on 31 st March, 2008, your Company had a strength of 1,079 employees, with 275 management staff and 804 workmen.",

Your Company has preferred an appeal against the above order and the matter is now before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.\n\nConsequent to the above orders, Income Tax Department had issued consequential orders under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act demanding Rs. 28.86 crore (revised) which was paid by your Company.\n\nii. Luxury Tax\n\nA Contempt Petition has been filed in the Supreme Court by the Commercial Tax Officer, on behalf of the Government of Andhra Pradesh against the Managing Director of your Company alleging contempt of the Supreme Court's judgement dated 20th January, 2005 setting aside levy of Luxury Tax, due to failure to pay an amount of Rs. 34.86 crore being the Luxury Tax allegedly collected from the customers by the Company after passing of the interim order dated 1 st June, 1999, but not paid to the State Government of Andhra Pradesh which is in violation of the judgement dated 20th January, 2005 of the Supreme Court.

Your Company and the Managing Director have both filed separate counter affidavits strenuously denying that there has been any contempt on their part, of the said Supreme Court judgement.\n\niii. Entry Tax\n\nEntry Tax has been struck down by virtually every High Court in the country including those in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam broadly on the ground that it is violative of Article 301 and not saved under Article 304(b) of the Constitution as it is not compensatory in nature as required in terms of the Supreme Court judgement in case of $\\mathrm{M} / \\mathrm{s}$.

Gay Wrappers\n\nThe Excise Department had demanded an amount of Rs.3.62 crore (including penalty and interest @24\\%) from your Company on the ground that Gay Wrappers (printed paper used for wrapping cigarette packets) had been manufactured and consumed by your Company without payment of duty during the period April 1996 to March 2002. Your Company had preferred an Appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bangalore which had initially granted a complete stay against pre-deposit of the amounts demanded. Subsequently, the Tribunal by its Order dated 8th October, 2004 had set aside the demands and allowed your Company's Appeal. The Excise Department has filed an Appeal against the said Order in the Supreme Court which is still pending. Notices have been received by your Company for subsequent periods, which are also pending.\n\nii. North-East\n\nYour Company had assisted its four contract manufacturers to clear the liability of the entire principal amount of Rs.31.20 crore demanded by the Excise Department consequent upon the Supreme Court upholding Section\n\n154 of the Finance Act, 2003 in terms of its Order dated 19th September, 2005. The Excise Department has now demanded a sum of Rs. 6.90 crore from two contract manufacturers by way of interest. Your Company is given to understand that the contract manufacturers have been advised that the levy of interest in the manner contemplated is contrary to law and therefore two of them have taken steps to seek appropriate legal remedies in the Guwahati High Court.\n\nOut of the total interest demand of Rs. 12.69 crore an amount of Rs. 10.67 crore is outstanding on date.\n\niii. Misclassification of Plain cigarettes\n\nThe Excise Department has issued a show cause notice dated 5th February, 2008 on your Company demanding differential duties of about Rs.41.12 crore covering the period from July 2003 to December 2007 on account of alleged misclassification of filter cigarettes as non-filter cigarettes. This is with regard to manufacture of certain brands of non-filter cigarette where the mouth-end of the cigarette rod comprising of Cut Rag Stem (CRS) has been considered by the Department to be a filter and differential duty demanded as payable for a filter cigarette. The Department's contention is baseless and contrary to facts. Accordingly, your Company is taking necessary steps to resist the demand by following the departmental remedies.\n\niv.Post Manufacturing Expenses\n\nYour Company has been involved in a long running dispute with the\n\nExcise Department spread over three decades on deduction of allowable post manufacturing expenses for the period 1 st March, 1975 to 28th February, 1983 and finalization of provisional assessments for that period. Although your Company had already won the case on merits up to the level of the Supreme Court, the Department had refused to grant refund of Rs.7. 15 crore on ground of unjust enrichment. This has now been settled in favour of your Company by the Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh in terms of their recent judgement dated 24th September, 2007. Consequently, your Company has received a refund of the above amount along with interest of Rs. 5.46 crore. As a matter of prudence, the said amount of refund received has not been accounted in the Profit \\& Loss Account for the year ended 31st March, 2008.\n\nPUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION\n\nSmoking \\& Health\ni. A Public Interest Petition has been filed in the Delhi High Court by the Tobacco Control Foundation of India (TCFI) against the Government and the cigarette manufacturers seeking a complete ban on the manufacture and sale of tobacco.

The matter came up for admission on 25th January 2008 and notice was ordered. Your Company has already received the notice and will be taking steps along with other members of the industry and the Tobacco Institute of India to defend itself in these proceedings.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS\n\nYour Company had entered into the Financial Services Business in 1993 through its subsidiary company, VST\n\nInvestments Limited (VSTI). Since your Company wanted to exit from the financial services business, VSTI was amalgamated with ITC Agro Tech Finance and Investments Limited (ITCATF) with effect from 1 st April, 1996 and the said amalgamation was approved by the Hon'ble A.P. High Court by its Order dated 30th December, 1996. However, certain amounts due to your Company remained with ITCATF.\n\nYour Company had also nominated two of its employees as directors on the Board of ITCATF to look after the investments and seek their recovery. Subsequently, ITCATF went into losses and eventually a winding up petition was instituted. The Andhra Pradesh High Court, by an Order dated 28th June, 2001 directed winding up of ITCATF and appointed the Official Liquidator (OL) as its Liquidator to take necessary steps. A Company petition was filed by the OL in the Hon'ble A.P. High Court seeking directions to some of the exDirectors of ITCATF to file a Statement of Affairs which had not been done.

The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging \\& Labelling) Rules, 2006 had originally prescribed pictorial warnings along with health messages and sign of skull and cross bones. However, due to vociferous objections from various sections of the industry and public, a Committee of a Group of Ministers was constituted to relook at the warnings. Based on their recommendations, a new set of labelling requirements have been prescribed under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2008 which were published on 16th March, 2008. These revised labelling requirements have to be implemented within three months from the date of notification, which is yet to be published. Your Company is once again taking various steps to comply with the revised labelling requirements which will involve considerable amount of investment in addition to the amount already spent, to develop the required\nprinting technology and also to redesign all the packaging in accordance with the labelling rules.\n\nCOMPANY EMPLOYEES\n\nUnder the provisions of Section 217 (2A) of the Companies Act, 1956, read with the Companies (Particulars of Employees) Rules, 1975 as amended, the particulars of employees are set out in annexure to this Report.\n\nYour Directors take this opportunity to record their deep appreciation of the continuous support and contribution from all employees in your Company.\n\nAUDITORS\n\nThe Auditors, Messrs.
