There is a system in which auditors can be apprised of the details of such requests.\nFurthermore, reports regarding the results of internal audits are provided to auditors on a regular basis. The Rules for Audits by Auditors also stipulate that auditors can request directors o provide business reports and request related departments subsidiaries, and other parties to provide reports if necessary. ix) Other systems to ensure that audit operations of auditors are carried out effectively\nThe Rules for Audits by Auditors ensure that auditors effectively exercise the authority to \"attend board of directors meetings and other important meetings,\" \"ask for explanations in cases of failure to attend meetings and read minutes and documents,\" \"read documents necessary to investigate business conditions and request related departments to provide reports,\" and \"request subsidiaries and affiliates to provide reports and investigate business and asset conditions.\"\nIn addition, they can hear opinions from lawyers, certified public accountants, consultants, and other outside experts if necessary\nthe health and happiness of people around the world through pursuit of excellence in life science in general and our research and experience in microorganisms in particular.\" To achieve this, the Company believes that it is important to implement management that places emphasis on strengthening and enhancing internal control functions as a company that is widely trusted by society\n\nBased on this perspective, the Company has made the following resolutions on basic policies regarding building internal control systems after reconfirming the current situation at the Company in relation to the development of interna control systems.\n\nMeanwhile, the contents of the resolutions will be revised on a timely basis in line with revisions to laws and environmental changes inside and outside the Company, aiming to further strengthen and enhance internal control systems.\n\n5. Other Corporate Governance Systems (1) Basic approach regarding timely disclosure\n\nWith respect to information disclosure, especially in a timely manner, in the Yakult Code of Ethics and Code of Practice, the Company makes the following commitment: \"The Company will actively disclose all relevant information to our customers, shareholders, employees and business partners and increase the transparency of management, to gain the full trust of society through our corporate activities.\" Based on this approach, the Company is disclosing information in a timely manner.\n\n(2) Internal structure related to timely disclosure\n- Facts and data appropriate for public disclosure from each department within the Company (including subsidiaries) are compiled by the Public Relations Department. In parallel each department within the Company, pursuant to the Rules for Decision-Making, decides items for disclosure based on prescribed decision-making procedures. Facts and data not vetted in this manner are not publicly disclosed. When making final decisions, the disclosing department liaises with the General Affairs Department, the body responsible for",

The General Affairs Department refers to two standards in making this determination: the Rules for Timely Disclosure and the status of other finalized disclosure decisions within the Company. The decision is then made to officially conduct the timely disclosure of facts and data meeting these criteria.\n- The Company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). Any information from the Company marked for timely disclosure is registered on TDnet, a system for timely disclosure provided by TSE. The registration of information for timely disclosure and responses to inquiries from TSE personnel are conducted by the General Affairs Department, the body responsible for coordinating timely disclosure. Following registration, information targeted for timely disclosure is quickly transmitted simultaneously to all relevant media outlets, with related materials disclosed at the same time on the Company's website.\n(3) Check functions to mitigate risks associated with the improper execution of timely disclosure\n- The Company has considered a variety of risk scenarios including those in which information marked for timely disclosure is inadvertently overlooked; information is prematurely disclosed; and data pertaining to sudden crises are not promptly disclosed. A single department, the General Affairs Department, which is responsible for coordinating timely disclosure, acquires and shares information about the criteria for determining the necessity of timely disclosure, and checks information pertaining to final decisions made internally, as well as primary information when sudden crises and incidents arise.

This occurred despite downside risks caused by the consequences of the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, the global economic slowdown, and the eroding employment situation in Japan.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Yakult Group (the \"Group\") worked to build awareness and understanding of the Probiotics-living microorganisms that provide health benefits by improving the balance of intestinal flora-that constitute the bedrock of our operations, while striving to communicate the superiority of our products. In addition, the Group endeavored to improve its performance by taking steps to shore up its sales organization, develop new products, upgrade its production facilities, and vigorously enhance its overseas operations and pharmaceuticals business.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, the Group recorded consolidated net sales of $¥ 312.6$ billion. Operating income climbed $2.0 \\%$, to $¥ 20.8$ billion, while the operating margin was $6.7 \\%$, unchanged from a year earlier. Consequently, net income increased $0.9 \\%$, to $¥ 13.3$ billion, and the return on sales was $4.3 \\%$, unchanged from the previous fiscal year.\n\n<chart>\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Fiscal Year} & \\textbf{Net Sales (Billions of yen)} \\\\\n\\hline\nFY 08 & 320 \\\\\n\\hline\nFY 09 & 310 \\\\\n\\hline\nFY 10 & 300 \\\\\n\\hline\nFY 11 & 310 \\\\\n\\hline\nFY 12 & 320 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n</chart>\n\n\n\\section*{SALES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND EARNINGS}\n\n\\section*{SALES}\n\nNet sales increased $2.2 \\%$, to $¥ 312.6$ billion, despite the impact of negative $¥ 4.2$ billion from foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nLooking at net sales by reporting segment (before reconciliation), Food and Beverages (Japan) accounted for $57.9 \\%$ of sales, or 1.9 percentage point lower than in the previous fiscal year. Food and Beverages (Overseas) accounted for $24.3 \\%$ of sales, or 1.7 percentage point higher than in the previous fiscal year. Pharmaceuticals generated $12.1 \\%$, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous fiscal year, and Others contributed $5.7 \\%$, up 0.3 percentage point from the previous fiscal year.\n\nIn the Americas, sales increased $3.9 \\%$, to $¥ 39.0$ billion, due to sales growth in the United States as Yakult expanded its sales area and the number of stores that sell its products. Growth in sales volume was also noted in Brazil and Mexico despite adverse economic conditions in these markets. In Asia and Oceania, sales climbed $25.4 \\%$, to $¥ 32.0$ billion, supported by steady sales growth in China and other key countries and regions. In contrast, sales in Europe declined $7.0 \\%$ to $¥ 8.0$ billion mainly due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, while robust sales were recorded in the Netherlands and Italy.\n\n- Overseas net sales (left scale)\n- Ratio to total net sales (right scale)\n\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\n\n- Operating income (left scale)\n- Operating margin (right scale)",

        "text": "COSTS, EXPENSES AND EARNINGS\n\nConsolidated cost of sales increased $3.0 \\%$, to $¥ 142.5$ billion. As a result, the cost of sales ratio rose 0.4 of a percentage point, to $45.6 \\%$. Gross profit increased $1.5 \\%$, to $¥ 170.0$ billion, and the gross profit margin decreased 0.4 of a percentage point, to $54.4 \\%$.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG\\&A) expenses increased $1.4 \\%$, to $¥ 149.2$ billion. This increase resulted mainly from increased R\\&D expenses for new drug development. The SG\\&A expense ratio decreased 0.4 of a percentage point, to $47.7 \\%$. R\\&D expenses edged up $¥ 0.9$ billion year on year, to $¥ 12.4$ billion. As a percentage of net sales, R\\&D expenses increased 0.2 of a percentage point, to $4.0 \\%$.\n\nAs a result, operating income rose $2.0 \\%$, to $¥ 20.8$ billion, with the operating margin unchanged from the previous fiscal year at 6.7\\%.\n\nOther income - net amounted to $¥ 5.1$ billion, up $¥ 4.1$ billion from a year earlier, mainly due to refund of social insurance premium and a foreign exchange gain.\n\nIncome taxes came to $¥ 8.6$ billion.\nConsequently, net income increased $0.9 \\%$, to $¥ 13.3$ billion, and the return on sales was $4.3 \\%$, unchanged from the previous fiscal year.\n\n\nOVERVIEW BY SEGMENT\n\nFOOD AND BEVERAGES (JAPAN): In Probiotic products, Yakult began activities aimed at vigorously promoting the value and appeal of our proprietary living Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota and Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult.\n\nIn our home delivery channel, we worked to develop more long-term customers using sales activities that get people to try our products through samples or trial use. The focus of these activities was Yakult 400 series products, including both our mainstay Yakult 400 fermented milk drink and Yakult 400LT.\n\nIn our retail store channel, Yakult sales promotion staff took steps to highlight the value and appeal of products, centered on fermented milk drink Yakult and Mil-Mil, a drinkable yogurt containing Bifidobacteria. We focused aggressively on the marketing of fermented milk drink Yakult Calorie Half, which contains fewer calories and tastes less sweet than the regular Yakult, after the product was revamped in September 2011.\n\nAnother product that underwent renewal was Pretio, which has been designated by the government as a food for specified health uses and designed for people with relatively high blood pressure. We staged a synchronized ad campaign titled \"Try Four Weeks and See for Yourself\" across TV, newspapers, the Internet and other media, as well as in-store promotions throughout Japan, beginning in January 2012, to boost sales.\n\nIn the first half of the fiscal year, our sales were affected by disruptions in product distribution caused by production suspensions at some of the facilities hit by the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, and sales disruptions at the damaged sales offices primarily along the Pacific Coast in northeastern Japan. The difficulty was aggravated by power shortages.\n\nWe redoubled sales efforts in the second half of the fiscal year as the product distribution structure was restored, and managed to post a year-on-year increase for the second half. Nevertheless, our full-year sales fell slightly short of the level achieved in the previous fiscal year.\n\nIn juices and other beverages, we completed the revamping of Toughman, our mainstay brand, on the occasion of the product's 30th anniversary in May 2011. Activities to boost the Toughman brand continued throughout the fiscal year and included the launch of Toughman Super, a more potent version fortified with royal jelly and higher Korean Ginseng content than the regular Toughman. Efforts to capture a greater share in the general fermented milk market included the product renewal for Milouge Ca Plus in April 2011, followed by the package renewal for Milouge Soda in June. To drive sales growth in the functional beverage and food sphere, we renewed Plum Drink with Galactooligosaccharide, a food for specified health uses, and the Gyutto Kenko Citrulline functional",

The enhanced product lines in the functional beverage and food category resulted in a year-on-year increase in sales for juices and other beverages as a whole. As a result, net sales decreased to $¥ 188.0$ billion, or $0.9 \\%$, from the prior fiscal year, and operating income fell $10.4 \\%$, to $¥ 9.9$ billion.\n\nFOOD AND BEVERAGES (OVERSEAS): Yakult's overseas operations commenced in March 1964 with the establishment of Yakult Co., Ltd. (Taiwan). They now extend to 31 countries and regions outside Japan, and are centered on 28 business bases and 1 research center. These operations focus primarily on the production and sale of the fermented milk drink Yakult. Average daily sales of all Yakult products overseas were approximately 21.17 million bottles in March 2012.\n\nIn the Americas, Yakult manufactures and sells the fermented milk drink Yakult and other products in Brazil and Mexico, and imports products for sale in Argentina, the United States, and other countries.\n\nIn the United States, preparation is underway for the construction of the first Yakult production facility in that country. It will be situated in Fountain Valley, California, and is scheduled to commence production in the fall of 2013. Net sales in the Americas increased to $¥ 39.0$ billion, or $3.9 \\%$, from the prior fiscal year, and operating income climbed $6.0 \\%$, to $¥ 8.8$ billion.\n\nIn Asia and Oceania, Yakult manufactures and sells the fermented milk drink Yakult and other products in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, China, and other countries.\n\nIn China, in an effort to boost sales in the interior, we opened branch offices in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province in February 2011 and Changsha, Hunan Province in March, following the branch opening in Wuhan, Hubei Province. In August 2011, our third production facility in China located at Tianjin Yakult Dairy Co., Ltd. began production of Yakult. The second production plant is planned for Guangzhou Yakult Co., Ltd. in anticipation of consistent sales growth in the provinces of Guangzhou and Hainan.\n\nIn India, sales of Yakult began in the city of Hyderabad in February 2012 via the retail store channel. To disseminate the Probiotics concept to a broad spectrum of people, we established Yakult India Microbiota and Probiotic Science Foundation, which hosted a probiotics symposium in December 2011.\n\nIn Thailand, two production facilities under Yakult (Thailand) Co., Ltd., an associated company accounted for by the equity method, suffered damages caused by flooding in October 2011, and their operation was suspended. They resumed shipments in December 2011. Net sales in Asia and Oceania increased to $¥ 32.0$ billion, or $25.4 \\%$, from the prior\nfiscal year, and operating income jumped $34.7 \\%$, to $¥ 5.5$ billion.\nIn Europe, Yakult manufactures the fermented milk drink Yakult and other products in the Netherlands, and sells them in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Italy, and other countries.\n\nOverall European sales in yen amounts were affected by the yen's strength, but sales in the Netherlands and Italy showed solid growth. Net sales in Europe decreased to $¥ 8.0$ billion, or $7.0 \\%$, from the prior fiscal year, and operating income fell $73.6 \\%$, to $¥ 0.2$ billion.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS: In Japan, we focused on promoting the proper use of the cancer chemotherapeutic agent Elplat, actively sponsoring lectures and presentations targeting healthcare professionals in this area. Similarly, in November 2011, we obtained approval for a change in Elplat's dosage and administration in connection with the postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer patients. Since then, we have redoubled efforts to recommend the parallel administration of Elplat with Capecitabine, an orally administered antineoplastic agent used in the XELOX regimen of chemotherapy known for its dosing convenience offered to patients and medical practitioners. In addition, we sought higher sales and higher market shares by specializing in oncology treatments and through active marketing and sales channel expansion for cancer chemotherapeutic agent Campto, activated folic acid drug Levofolinate Yakult, antineoplastic antimetabolite Gemcitabine Yakult, and recombinant DNA G-CSF chemotherapy treatment Neu-up.\n\nIn the area of R\\&D, an exclusive license was granted by 4SC AG in April 2011 for the development and commercialization in Japan of oral HDAC inhibitor Resminostat, which is owned and under development by 4SC as a cancer treatment drug. This was followed by an option agreement in November 2011 with LivTech Inc. concerning an exclusive, worldwide license for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of LIV-2008, humanized monoclonal anticancer antibodies program created by LivTech Inc. We are expanding the development pipeline for these drugs as well as for multi-kinase inhibitors PR509 and PR610 by Proacta Inc. and Akt inhibitor Perifosine by Æterna Zentaris Inc., for which Yakult signed agreements, in an effort to strengthen their position in the cancer treatment area.\n\nOutside Japan, we worked hard to boost sales of Campto, whose market share has declined since the emergence of generic drugs.\n\nAs a result, brisk growth in domestic sales overcame a year-on-year drop in overseas sales, resulting in an increase in consolidated sales in the Pharmaceuticals segment of $1.3 \\%$, to $¥ 39.4$ billion. Operating income decreased $1.0 \\%$, to $¥ 10.1$ billion.",

We followed this with the release in January 2012 of Lactdew S.E. Hyalurongel featuring proprietary moisturizing ingredients.\n\nAs a result of the above, the overall Cosmetics operations achieved results surpassing the previous fiscal year, despite the impact of the earthquake and tsunami, which affected sales operations.\n\nIn our professional baseball team operations, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows competed for the championship until the final stage of the regular season and advanced to the Climax Series.

This primarily resulted from an increase in inventories and an increase in receivables despite an increase in income before income taxes and minority interests.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $¥ 6.7$ billion, to $¥ 28.3$ billion. Cash was mainly used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, specifically for the new establishment and expansion of production facilities.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $¥ 9.3$ billion, an decrease of $¥ 3.1$ billion from the previous fiscal year. This payment was mainly attributed to the repayment of lease obligations and the payment of dividends.\n\nAs a result, cash and cash equivalents at year-end amounted to $¥ 75.6$ billion, a net decrease of $¥ 11.0$ billion from the previous fiscal year-end.\n\nDIVIDENDS\n\nWe give top priority to the payment of a higher and stable dividend to shareholders by setting the annual dividend at a base of $¥ 20.0$ per share.
