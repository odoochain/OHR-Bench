The account is really interesting, and it is worth careful study. As presented in a balance sheet covering two years it affords a graphic illustration of what ambition can do in the short space of twenty-four months. Here it is:\n\nWILLIAM MCKINLEY IN ACCOUNT WITH THE UNITED STATES.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l r}\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{Dr.} \\\\\nTo one archipelago & \\$20,000,000 \\\\\nTo benevolently assimilating the same, & \\\\\n730 days at \\$750,000 a day. & 547,000,000 \\\\\nTo expenses able negotiators Paris treaty & 220,000 \\\\\nTo two islands which able negotiators & \\\\\nthought they had bought & 100,000 \\\\\n \n& \\$567,322,000 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l r}\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{Cr.} \\\\\nBy two years' exports to Philippines, say \\$3,200,000, & \\\\\nprofit on which at 12 per cent. is. & \\$384,000 \\\\\n \n& 384,000 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nHowever, this adverse balance is perhaps set off by that \" favorable\" balance of which the Major boasts as a proof of our unexampled prosperity. But let that be as it may, the money side of the question seems to be rather against us. Nor is this all. There is the loss of life in battle and as the result of disease incident even to a \"Christian\" war. According to the official report of the War Department the casualty account stood thus at the chose of business, January 30 , 1901 :",

Perhaps another item may also be worked in as an offset to. our casualties, namely, the destruction of Filipino homes, churches, hospitals, schools and other heathen evidences of the need of benevolent assimilation. But no one can tell what this destruction has footed up, yet the total must be something glorious, if not in pesos, at least in the anguish of women and the terror and suffering of little children driven by our Christian warriors into the swamp and the jungle and mountain fastnesses from their burning homes.\n\nThe Christian world has been horrified at the wholesale murder of the Boers of South Africa for the accomplishment of one of the most gigantic robberies in the history of the world, but the acts of the McKinley administration have heen worse. To murder and robbery the most infamous treachery has been added. We accepted the Filipinos as friends and allies; we used them in the conquest of Manila from the Spaniards; we made them promises of self-government through our official representatives, and then when we thought that we could dispense with their continued services we made upon them a war of extermination, destroying not only men in arms, whose right to resistance was unquestionable, but also noncombatants, women and children, hundreds of whom have been benevolently assimilated on the points of United States bayonets.",
