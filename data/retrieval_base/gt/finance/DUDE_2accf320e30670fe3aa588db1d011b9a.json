The average premium shall be computed on the effective date of this policy and at the beginning of each policy year thereafter, by applying the premium rates then in effect to the amount of life insurance then in force at the respective ages (nearest birthday) of the persons then insured, and dividing the sum of the individual premiums so obtained by the number of thousands of dollars of insurance then in force.\nSuch average premium rates shall also be used in calculating adjustments of premiums due the Company for insurance hereunder becoming effective at any time subsequent to the date hereof, and in calculating any unearned premiums due the Policyholder on account of insurance hereunder terminated.\nPremium adjustments for insurance becoming effective or insurance terminating on the first day of a policy month shall be computed from that day.

A. COMPUTATION AND PAYMENT. The policyholder shall pay the standard premium to the company in accordance with the provisions of the policy other than this rider or other Retrospective Premium Riders. Upon the computation of the retrospective premium (which shall be made within one month after the termination of the first policy period and each succeeding period of one year), if the retrospective premium is less than the premium previously paid, the difference shall be applied by the company towards payment of the subsequent year's premium.\nB. USE OF RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUM RETURNS. If the aggregate of any return premium hereunder shall be in excess of the employer's share of the aggregate cost, such excess shall be applied by the employer for the sole benefit of the employees, but payment of any such return premium by the company to the employer shall discharge the company's liability with respect thereto.\n5. CANCELLATION. In the event of cancellation by the employer or by the company for nonpayment of premium:\n\nThe standard premium shall be the premium for that part of the applicable period during which the policy was in force.\n\nThe standard premium, so computed shall be used to determine the basic premium for such period, and is the minimum retrospective premium for such period.\n\nIf, however, the policy is not renewed at the end of any policy period, then any accrued retrospective premium adjustment will be paid to the policyholder.",
