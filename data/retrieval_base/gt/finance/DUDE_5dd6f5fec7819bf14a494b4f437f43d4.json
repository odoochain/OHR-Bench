The mid-session consensus revenue review raised FY19 general fund revenue by $\\$ 93$ million to $\\$ 6.37$ billion. HB2 sub and HB1 have FY19 general fund appropriations of $\\$ 6.32$ billion, up $\\$ 249$ million or 4.1 percent from FY18. This amount virtually matches the Executive recommendation. Excluding compensation, the general fund increase is 2.7 percent.\n\nThe bill replaces $\\$ 77$ million of the nonrecurring revenues used to balance the FY18 and prior year budgets when revenues were tight, including $\\$ 19$ million of supplemental severance tax funding in public school transportation and instructional materials, $\\$ 18$ million of tobacco settlement revenue used to support Medicaid, and $\\$ 6$ million of state road fund revenue for Motor Vehicle Department operations.\n\nPublic Education. The bill appropriates $\\$ 2.76$ billion of general fund, an increase of $\\$ 62$ million, or 2.3 percent for public school support and related expenditures from the FY18 operating level. The appropriations include $\\$ 17$ million to boost minimum teacher salary levels, $\\$ 23$ million to increase the at-risk student funding formula factor, $\\$ 15$ million to increase pre-kindergarten and K-3 Plus programming, and $\\$ 19$ million to increase appropriations and replace use of supplemental severance tax bonds for school transportation and instructional materials. Additionally, the HB2 sub addresses funding formula loopholes, establishes new provisions for school spending efficiency and accountability, and improves transparency for some departmental initiatives.\n\nHigher Education. HB2 has $\\$ 785$ million for higher education, an increase of $\\$ 6$ million, mostly for the instruction. The bill adds $\\$ 500$ thousand for the office of the medical investigator, $\\$ 120$ thousand for minority student services, $\\$ 400$ thousand for workforce and business development programs, and $\\$ 250$ thousand for agricultural research to help farmers deal with crop-killing pests.\n\nHealth and Human Services. The state benefited from a new Medicaid forecast showing rate reductions for new managed care contracts, lower enrollment, federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, and a one year waiver of a federal tax on MCOs. The Medicaid total is $\\$ 933$ million, up $\\$ 17$ million from FY18. The HB2 sub includes $\\$ 3.5$ million more for Medicaid provider rate increases for nursing homes, behavioral health and primary care, and $\\$ 5.4$ million more for the Health Department to address rising costs and the waiting list for the developmentally disabled Medicaid waiver program. The HB2 sub has an additional $\\$ 29.4$ million, an 11.8 percent increase for the Children, Youth, and Families Department including $\\$ 23$ million for childcare assistance, $\\$ 1.5$ million for home visiting, and $\\$ 2.5$ million for early prekindergarten. The bill increased Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding for childcare assistance by $\\$ 2$ million. The CYFD Protective Services program received an additional $\\$ 2.6$ million to reduce vacancies, $\\$ 2.6$ million for the care and support of children in care of the agency, and $\\$ 500$ thousand to increase domestic violence services and training statewide.\n\nEconomic Development and Tourism. HB2 sub increases the FY19 appropriation for the JTIP training program by $\\$ 2$ million and tourism marketing by $\\$ 750$ thousand. HB2 also has $\\$ 10$ million nonrecurring appropriations for JTIP and LEDA.\n\nJudiciary. The HB2 sub increases the FY19 general fund appropriation for the judiciary, including 2.5 percent more for the courts, 3.8 percent more for the public defender, and 4.7 percent more for the district attorneys. In the courts, the HB2 sub replaces exhausted fund balances in the operating budget, reduces vacancy rates, and provides funding for special projects to improve court efficiencies. For the public",

Further, public safety staff, state police, prison guards and parole officers and district attorney staff would receive an additional 4.5 percent; court personnel, social workers, and nurses would receive an additional 2.5 percent; and classroom teachers would receive an additional 0.5 percent.
