Date of Submission:\n2. Agency:\n3. Bureau:\n4. Name of this Capital Asset:\n5. Unique Project (Investment) Identifier: (For IT investment only, see section 53. For all other, use agency ID system.)\n6. What kind of investment will this be in FY2009? (Please Mixed Life Cycle\n\nNOTE: Investments moving to O\\&M in FY2009, with\nPlanning/Acquisition activities prior to FY2009 should not select O\\&M. These investments should indicate their current status.)\n8. Provide a brief summary and justification for this investment, including a brief description of how this closes in part or in whole an identified agency performance gap:\nThe Global Network Program operates \\& modernizes the State Department's global network. This network forms the backbone of the Department's IT infrastructure, providing essential communication to 260 diplomatic posts around the world, including embassies, consulates, and multi-agency missions. It also connects 240 additional sites, such as post annexes. Employees increasingly rely on the network's communications to further the United States' foreign policy goals. Global Network supports the strategic goal: strengthening consular \\& management capabilities.\n\nThe Department envisions an IT environment that allows access to IT resources \"via an integrated continually refreshed infrastructure that extends to mobile end-user devices..\"(State \\& USAID J oint Strategic Plan FY07-12). To support this vision, the Global Network is taking bold steps to provide a network that is secure, always available, and has sufficient bandwidth to support a multitude of services. This effort also helps prepare the Department for the IT Infrastructure Line of Business Initiative.\n\nThe Global Network is a consolidated business case, integrating subprograms:\n1. Enterprise Network Management modernizes \\& maintains communications over the global network, providing essential connectivity to Foreign Affairs personnel around the world.\n2. Bandwidth Management analyzes network capacity requirements, helps posts procure network connectivity, \\& provides funding for global bandwidth. Use of innovative technologies has helped the program increase bandwidth capacity while reducing the cost per bit of bandwidth.\n3. Enterprise Software Licensing establishes \\& maintains enterprise software licensing agreements, lowering the prices the Department pays per license based on volume purchases.\n4. The Alternate Communications Site (ACS), housed at a FEMA location, is an alternate site for routing essential communications in the event the primary locations are not operational.\n5. The InfoCenter is a 24 -hour IT help desk providing first-tier customer support for embassies, consulates, \\& offices throughout the world.\n9. Did the Agency's Executive/Investment Committee\n\nYes approve this request?\na. If \"yes,\" what was the date of this approval?\n\n8/28/2007\n10. Did the Project Manager review this Exhibit?\n\nYes\n12. Has the agency developed and/or promoted cost Yes effective, energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable techniques or practices for this project?\na. Will this investment include electronic assets\n\nYes\n(including computers)?\nb. Is this investment for new construction or major\n\nNo retrofit of a Federal building or facility?

Briefly describe how investment risks are reflected in the life cycle cost estimate and investment schedule:\n\nAs part of the project management process, all Global Network projects identify and analyze risks during project planning. Risk analysis includes classifying the risks and assessing the risk probability, impact, immediacy, and controllability. These attributes help the Global Network program manager identify the greatest risks to the program and ensure they are appropriately mitigated.\n\nTo facilitate risk analysis, all Global Network project managers (PMs) attended a risk assessment workshop. Using a risk assessment tool developed in concert with the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), the PMs answered a series of questions to more objectively quantify risk probability and impact, particularly related the project cost and schedule performance.\n\nAll projects within the Global Network follow the Managing State Projects (MSP) lifecycle and report on their risks at each control gate, in addition to semiannual project status reviews. Cost and schedule performance is tracked within the Earned Value Management System (EVMS), which has helped PMs understand how realized risks have affected the project - leading to better future estimates.",
