Extended leave without pay is defined as absence on such leave throughout the entire period covered by the estimate.\n(c) Casual workers - the spot\" without appointment, for short intervals of time to cope with fire, flood, and other emergencies.\n(d) Workers or trainees whose compensation is in the nature of an allowance, e. g., prisoners of war and inmates of prisons and penitentiaries.\n(e) Any personal services the expense of which is properly chargeable to \" 07 other contractual services\" under the instructions in Budget-Treasury Regulation No. 1, Revised (unless, in the case of certain war agencies, the Bureau of the Budget specifies otherwise).\n\nLINE ENTRIES\n1. Departmental and field services represent employees occupying \"departmental\" and \"field\" positions as determined by the work performed, regardless of geographical location.\n2. Full-time employees means those, regardless of class or nature of appointment, who work the hours and days required by the official workweek for the group or class of employees in which they are employed. (For example, the official workweek of clerical employees may be 5 days of 8 hours each; thus, employees required to perform clerical duties for 5 days of 8 hours each per week are full-time employees. Similarly, if the official workweek for a teacher is 5 days of 6 hours each, all teachers who are required to work the 5 days of 6 hours each per week are full-time employees.) Such employees may be compensated on a salary or wage basis at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly rates.\n3. Part-time employees are those, regardless of class or nature of appointment, who work hours or days less than the hours and days of work for full-time employees in the same group or class. Such employees may be compensated on a fee basis, or on a salary or wage basis, at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or per unit rates.\n4. Month, for the purpose of computing man-months, means the calendar month. With respect to piece-rate and fee-basis employees' services, these may be translated into man-months on whatever formula the employing agency finds most practical. The formula used should be explained in a memorandum accompanying the estimate. Man-months will represent the total work performed during the period. Ceiling allowances stated in terms of man-months are not cumulative from one period to another.\n5. Personal services obligations represents the total obligations during the estimate period for services to be rendered under each of the types of positions. Under \"Justification\" explain the need for any funds shown under headings not provided for in the Budget, and whether permanent, temporary, or \"WAE\" funds are expected to be used.\n6. Employees temporarily detailed will, in accordance with Civil Service Commission rules and regulations, be considered as serving in their regularly assigned position.\n\nCOLUMN DESIGNATIONS\n7. Column ( A ) is the sum of columns ( B ) and ( C ).\n8.

Such employees may be compensated on a salary or wage basis, at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly rates. WAE, \\$1-per-year or \\$1-per-month, and WOC employees should not be reported under this head.\n(b) Temporary. Employees requested under this heading should include all personnel reflected in the personnel schedules in the Budget or supplemental estimates as \"temporary employment,\" regardless of the nature of their individual appointments or absence of formal appointment. Such employees may be paid on a salary or wage basis at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or per unit rates. WAE, \\$1-per-year or \\$1-per-month, and WOC employees should not be reported under this heading.\n(c) WAE employees are those serving on an irregular or occasional basis. Such employees may be compensated on a fee basis or on a salary or wage basis at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or per unit rates.\n(d) $\\$ 1$-per-year or $\\$ 1$-per-month employees are those serving on the compensation basis indicated by the\ntitle hereof.\n9.

Saunders, Acting Chief, Budget and Procedures Branch, advised me that the agency budget for the period of l July 1945 to 1 February 1946 had been established in the amount of \\$10,500,000. This budget covers a calendar period of seven months.\n(2) He stated that his office is responsible for maintaining the fiscal control records incident to this budget and that expenditures during the months of July and August have amounted to approximately $\\$ 2,500,000$ per month, or a total of $\\$ 5,000,000$. This leaves a balance for the remaining five months of the budgetary period of \\$5,500,000. On a pro-rata basis it would make available slightly more than \\$1,000,000 per month.\n(3) It will be readily observed that if the current rate of expenditure in the amount of $\\$ 2.500,000$ per month is continued that funds will be available only until approximately the middle of November 1945. Under these circumstances it is obvious that drastic curtailments will have to be made in personnel and other activities in the immediate future.",
