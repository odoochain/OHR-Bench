Resolutions.\n\nVice-Chairperson Jones read the resolution honoring former Police Commissioner John H. Sheard (Posthumously).\n\nRESOLUTION HONORING FORMER POLICE COMMISSIONER JOHN H. SHEARD (POSTHUMOUSLY)\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l}\nWHEREAS & The City of Detroit is blessed to have civic leaders who keep the soul and spirit of the City, community, and residents \\\\\n& strong and uplifted decade after decade. Bishop John H. Sheard is counted among these remarkable men and women \\\\\n& whose noble works and accomplishments are done with quiet humility for the greater good of all; and \\\\\nWHEREAS & John Henry Sheard was born in 1937 in Mississippi to Kizziah and O.S. Sheard. Mindful of his family's teachings, he \\\\\n& joined the Great Migration when he was only 17 years old, carrying very little money but tons of faith; and \\\\\nWHEREAS & Young John came to Detroit determined to work hard and make a difference in his new hometown. He influenced many as \\\\\n& he taught social science and operated a driving school. However, his true calling showed as he followed his father's \\\\\n& footsteps into the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and became a minister in 1973. Named to lead Mitchell Street COGIC \\\\\n& in 1982, Pastor Sheard built a ministry that outgrew several buildings from the eastside to the west side to become \\\\\n& Greater Mitchell Temple. Pastor Sheard also rose in national prominence, rising to Bishop in the COGIC organization and \\\\\n& holding leadership roles - including two decades as Chair of the COGIC Board of Bishops - that helped COGIC become \\\\\n& the largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States of America; and \\\\\nWHEREAS & In 1994, Mayor Dennis Archer named Bishop Sheard to the Board of Police Commissioners as the Police Department and \\\\\n& community once again worked to address police brutality. During his 1994-98 term, Police Commissioner Sheard \\\\\n& provided much needed wisdom and guidance to help Detroit navigate the aftermath of the fatal Malice Green beating \\\\\n& and police court trial and to address complaints about police shootings and abuses of force; and \\\\\nWHEREAS & Bishop Sheard, despite the countless demands on his time as a family man and a renowned leader, always kept Detroit a \\\\\n& priority. At times of transition or challenge, City leaders knew they could count on Bishop Sheard to provide wise counsel \\\\\n& - and to roll up his sleeves and get to work on issues spanning civil rights, anti-arson patrols, park beautification, and \\\\\n& civilian oversight of law enforcement; and \\\\\nWHEREAS & Bishop Sheard always made everyone feel like a longtime friend, and he always cultivated Detroit's well-being and \\\\\n& progress. On November 11, 2021, this beloved and faithful servant passed away, leaving all of Detroit to grieve with his \\\\\n& family, the Greater Mitchell Temple congregation, the entire COGIC organization, and the many, many others who knew \\\\\n& him.\n\\end{tabular}\n\nNOW THEREFORE BE IT\n\nRESOLVED That the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners, speaking on behalf of the citizens of the great City of Detroit, awards this resolution posthumously to Bishop John H. Sheard for his civic leadership and community service in Detroit, including his",
