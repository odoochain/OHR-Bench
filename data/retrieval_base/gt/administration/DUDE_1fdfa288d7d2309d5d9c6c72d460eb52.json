Roll Call | Introductions | Icebreaker\n\nIcebreaker: What is your New Years Resolution\nKelly called roll. There was a quorum of the Northside Green Zone Task Force. There was not a quorum of the Southside Green Zone Council.\n2. Adoption of the agenda\n\nSamara moved to adopt the agenda, Vanessa seconded. Kelly called roll for Northside Green Zone. The agenda was unanimously adopted.\n3. Land Acknowledgment was offered by LesLee.\n\"As we begin, let's pause for a moment to contemplate an Indigenous Land and Enslaved Peoples. We have to start with honesty. Land acknowledgement is a traditional custom dating back centuries for many Native communities and nations. For non-Indigenous communities, land acknowledgement is a powerful way of showing respect and honoring the Indigenous Peoples of the land on which we work and live.\"\n\nSource: Native-Land.ca | Our home on native land",

        "text": "The Indigenous Land and Enslaved Peoples Acknowledgement: \"We invite you to recognize the written histories of United States specifically Midwestern States as fractured. Let us acknowledge then that we are currently on the land of the Indigenous who continue to be systematically erased by policies and practices that remove their histories from this place. Let us honor the enslaved people who built the wealth and foundation of the United States. Let us recognize the histories of the United States as complicit with the racism of white supremacy.\n\"We recognize that these difficult histories persist in present-day racial realities and privileges within our movement of Building Decarbonization movement. We commit to dismantling racism in spaces of our work. We invite you to work beside us to create change.\"\n\nAdapted from: James Madison University - Indigenous Land and Enslaved Peoples Acknowledgement (jmu.edu)\n4. Community Air monitoring - project update. Samara opened the topic. Kelly gave update and answered questions.\n\nAir sensor requests and distribution: The city has received more than 100 location requests from over 50 different individuals (see map of locations requested, below). The city and MPCA are reviewing to requests to determine which type of air sensor is best based on air pollution concerns named by the requestor. The city and MPCA have about 30 AQMesh air sensors (tracks multiple pollutants) and a similar number of Purple Air sensors (lower cost, only tracks particulate matter). Not all locations will receive an air sensor. Priority will be given to requests in the Green Zones and areas adjacent to the Green Zones. Sensors within a block or two of each other will be limited to only one sensor, with priority given to requests from an individual household rather than someone who has requested multiple air sensors. Schools will also be prioritized, but they may receive air sensors later using other funding sources.\n\nUpcoming project meetings: the City and MPCA will be scheduling a meeting with educators from schools who have already submitted requests for sensors, a community meeting for all folks interested in the community air monitoring project, and informational sessions for folks who are receiving air sensors. These meetings will occur in late January into February. Stay tuned for emails from Kelly Muellman or Jenni Lansing.\n\nFunding: Air sensors are being purchased with City funds. MPCA and the City are applying for EPA funding to increase funding for the project. The application is due February 25, 2022. We want community input in the application and will discuss at the next community air monitoring meeting.\n\nQ\\&A:\n- Green Zones air sensors should be prioritized.\n- Schools in the Green Zones should be prioritized. Reach out to more schools. [Kelly responded that Jenni Lansing from the City's Health Department has been in touch with Minneapolis Public Schools and an email just went out to all of the STEM educators on Monday]",

Andrew opened the topic. Julia presented competition proposal / timeline.\nThe Northside Green Zone brainstormed ideas for the billboards at their December meeting. One idea that came up was doing a competition for the design (art and words). The Green Zone Summit planning committee discussed coinciding billboard competition with GZ Summit (tentatively: Saturday, May 21). The competition would launch the second week of February. The competition would focus on youth - connect with Northside Safety N.E.T., schools, JXTA, parks, etc. Designs would be due the first week of April, before the next joint Green Zone meeting. Green Zone members would vote at April joint meeting on the winner. We would announce the winner at the GZ Summit.\n\nDiscussion questions:\n\nDoes this timeline sound good?\nAny specifics that we want to include in the call for submissions?\nMake the competition specifically for youth or open to all with targeted outreach to youth?",

        "text": "- Winners / Prizes: The prize is both getting this name on the billboard and a cash prize of $\\$ 100$ (?). We could put all the submissions in a coloring book, even if they are not a winner. Second or third place designs could be used for other materials. We could have more winners ( 4 winners if we're having 4 billboards).\n- Youth competition: General agreement that we should have the competition exclusively for youth. What ages are considered to be youth? 24 and under? Minimum age?\n- Question: Open to youth outside the Green Zones? Answer: open to outside the Green Zones.\n- Minneapolis Public Schools has 23 years old or younger as youth (because of transition plus for developmental or physically disabled students). Students are also eligible to 23 for English language services.\n- This is also an opportunity to work with youth and bring them into this board.\n- Call for Designs: Include some \"minimum\" items or criteria in the competition announcement to have a focus that reflects and helps promote the GZ work and goals. Colors? Words? Do we provide the words or will the artist? How are we going to teach the candidates some basic things about the Green Zones?\n- Partnerships:\n- Karen Clark shared that Womens Environmental Institute received funds for signage in Southside Green Zone. The purpose is to notify people when they are entering or leaving SSGZ and why the GZ is there or what it means. They haven't started anything yet.\n- Discuss with Mary Altman (city of Minneapolis public art) in arts (how to create proposals and review proposals)\n- Promotion with KMOJ.\n- Ms. Keyes nephew is good artist.\n- Samara is a youth member (20 years old) of SSGZ. One of her majors is studio art. Would be open to discussing this more.\n- Timeline: If we are launching in second week of February, that gives us about 5 weeks to put together guidelines and a summary of what we are looking for. Clearly state the intention of the billboards.\n- Judging: Start building a judging committee (Ms. Adams, Markeeta’s nephew, Samara, etc.). Ask Northside Safety N.E.T. to be part of review committee?\n\nNext Steps: Julia and Kelly will share a write-up of the proposal and ask for feedback from Green Zone members.\n\n6. 2022 Green Zone funding\n\nCouncil members Cano and Gordon proposed the following budget amendment, which was approved by the City Council in December: \"Amending the 2022 Mayor's Recommended Budget for the City Coordinator's Department, Sustainability Division (00100-8400200) in the amount of $\\$ 100,000$ for one-time funds to hire consultant(s) who will work with the Mayor, the City Council, City Staff, and members of the Northside and Southside Green Zones Councils to assess the success and challenges of the City's Green Zones efforts and present recommendations for improvement.

To kick off the conversation, LesLee proposed going with the plan for $\\$ 100$ / meeting for GZ members, $\\$ 25,000$ for consultant. The work of the GZ members is worth compensation, GZ members put in a lot of time and the work is important. There are similar boards at the City and in other cities where \"volunteer\" board members are paid a stipend.\n\nDiscussion:\n- We've been doing this work unpaid. Will this change expectations? Would it change motivations?\n- People are on the committees to volunteer. It's not about the money, but compensation is important. Maybe we should vote if we want to get paid?\n- Q: How is this comparable to what Southside Green Zone received from grant funding? What will happen at the end of this year?\n- A: Southside Green Zone received \\$100/meeting initially, then went down to $\\$ 50 /$ meeting, and now there is no funding. This funding would be for 1 year for both NS and SS. We would need to find another source at the end of this year.\n- Would do this work for free but others might want a stipend. Would be more inclined to give more to consultant and less to stipends for members, as the consultant might be helpful to SGZ to understand how to maintain and increase membership.\n- Maybe an opt in/opt out situation?\n- I fully support $\\$ 100$ compensation per meeting. Those folks who don't want to get paid can opt out from getting paid.\n- Can a green zone member BE HIRED as the consultant? They're already up to speed\n- Create a poll\n- Want us to be more effective with the City. Could the evaluator look at this?\n\nNext steps: Each Green Zone will discuss the consultant scope of work at their February meetings and we will create a poll to determine stipend amount.\n\nAnnouncements\n\n7.
