This Generic System Model contains the Components and Parameters which can be found to exist in all Systems. There are only Three possibilities:\n1. Things - or what we will refer to as Nodes. They are physical entities which can be found at a specific Location in the Real World.\n2. Connections - or what we will refer to as Relationships. They are Abstract Concepts which may or may not have a specific Location in the Real World.\n3. Organization - or what we will refer to as Networks. They are both Abstract and Physical Concepts which may or may not have a specific location in the Real Work\nfig. 1 -",

Whenever analyzing any Phenomena or Problem we should first attempt to isolate the most Fundamental Components or Parameters of the particular System(s) under investigation. Such a procedure enables us to be sure that we have not accidentally ignored something which would be important in our Analysis. For example, when given an assignment to develop a Computer Program for a certain Game, we should use this Methodology to First establish what the Problem Space of this System would be. I will define the Problem Space as a representation of all of the fundamental Components or Parameters which can be used to describe the Phenomena under investigation. The Problem Space in essentially a Model of the Game System's Physical and Abstract Parameters, together with specific rules governing the playing of the",

Models are used by Scientists and others, in order to construct representations of Reality which then allow us to study the Phenomena Under investigation. The Scientific Method encompasses four basic Models of Reality:\nfig 3 -",

The ideal situation is to create an association of Models which allow for the least overlap between Categories as is possible, the reason for this should be obvious.\n\nSome of the problems when conducting Systems Analysis, especially when dealing with Scientific Methodology, are the problems of Measurement and Specification of the Model:\n1. Measurement - Uses quantitative methods to determine the quantities of each Component of the System. It involves strictly, the use of Scientific qualities.\n2. Specification - Specifies the Parameters under which the System Operates. Specification uses both Qualitative and Quantitative Methods. It involves both Artistic and Scientific Qualities.\nfig. 4 -",
