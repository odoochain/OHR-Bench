Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Activity. In this order, the President directed that DHS \"shall provide, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, personnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property.\"\n\nIn furtherance of that directive, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security has formalized the DHS Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT) to provide an ongoing assessment of potential civil unrest and property destruction and to address internal resource allocation and potential surge activity to ensure the continuing protection of people and property.\n\nAdditionally, with the consent of other Departments and Agencies, DHS has determined that it is in the public interest and fiscally sound for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) to partner with other federal law enforcement to execute the direction of the President. To that end, DHS began coordination with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) to establish information/intelligence sharing and resource coordination as outlined in the order.\n\nCBP will be supporting this effort by deploying personnel to provide support over the July $4^{\\text {th }}$ holiday weekend which has the potential for increased disruptive activity at specific locations across the country that could threaten our personnel and the Federal facilities and property they protect.\n\nGuidance\n\nAll inquiries from national media outlets should be referred to CBP OPA HQ (cbpmediarelations@hq.dhs.gov).CBP public affairs officers in the field may use this PAG to prepare responses to inquiries submitted by local and regional media outlets in their area of responsibility.\n\nRequests for interviews are to be declined at this time.\nThe OPA lead for this issue is:\n- Stephanie Malin, Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, stephanie.malin@cbp.dhs.gov",

        "text": "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nKey Messages\n- President Trump acted to defend our Nation's historical monuments, statues, and memorials by signing an EO on June 26, 2020 that ensures that any person or group that destroys or vandalizes a monument, memorial, or statue, or those who incite violence and illegal activity, are fully prosecuted to the extent of the law.\n- The EO, \"Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Activity,\" directs DHS to provide personnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property.\n- In recent weeks rioters have defaced and torn down monuments and statues honoring some of the most important figures in our Nation's storied history. These monuments memorialize the history we all share as Americans, and they deserve to be defended for future generations. Some examples:\n- In Portland, mobs tore down statues of our Founding Fathers--George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n- In San Francisco, rioters tore down a statue honoring Ulysses S. Grant.\n- There are calls to remove statues of Abraham Lincoln in Boston and Washington, DC.\n- A statue of Hans Christian Heg, who died fighting for the Union Army during the civil war, was torn down in Wisconsin.\n- In response to this EO, on July 1, DHS established the Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT) to conduct ongoing assessments of potential violence or destruction and allocate resources to protect people and property.\n- While the Department respects every American's right to protest peacefully, violence and civil unrest will not be tolerated.\n\nCBP Statement:\n\"CBP stands ready to support our federal law enforcement partners to protect Federal facilities and property during the upcoming July $4^{\\text {th }}$ holiday weekend at locations across the country. CBP is actively identifying employees for immediate deployment to provide direct support to the Federal Protective Service and our interagency partners.\"\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: Why are CBP officers and agents being deployed to cities across the country?\nA.

We will have resources deployed in several states at Federal facilities and properties however, it would not be appropriate to disclose law enforcement operational specifics which could jeopardize operational security.\n\nAdditionally, we will have personnel on standby to be used as a strategic reserve that can deploy within 6 hours of notification by the Department and to any location in the United States\n\nQ: Did the deployed CBP agents/officer receive any specialized training prior to these deployments? What training do agents/officers receive to enable them to assist with civil unrest?\nA. All CBP officers and agents have received training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) and are trained to assist other law enforcement entities in these types of situations. Personnel deployed have specialized training for operations in chaotic environments such as the ones we have recently faced across the country.\n\nQ: What is the timeline for these deployments? When will CBP agents/officers be deployed? How long will these deployments last?\nA. We do not give out operational specifics, however we hope this support will be short-term, just for the July $4^{\\text {th }}$ weekend. Depending on the availability, law enforcement entities may continue to request additional support from CBP as needed.\n\nQ: What is CBPs role in the PACT?\nA. As a law enforcement component under DHS, CBP will be providing support, as requested, to the Federal Protective Service to protect Federal facilities and property.\n\nQ: When did the request for support come?\nA. DHS officially formed the PACT on July 1 which initiated the request for support from DHS law enforcement components.\n\nQ: Will you be deploying drones again?\nA: At this time CBP Air and Marine Operations has assets on standby to assist as needed.",
