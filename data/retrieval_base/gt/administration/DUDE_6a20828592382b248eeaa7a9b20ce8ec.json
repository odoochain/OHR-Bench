The Mortgage is not satisfied or discharged by any intermediate payment of all or part of the Obligations Secured but remains a continuing security for payment of the Obligations Secured, notwithstanding any change in the amount, nature or form of the Obligations Secured or any renewal, extension, amendment or replacement of the Agreements.\n\nOur charge upon your interest in the property subject to the Mortgage will end when:\n(i) You have repaid the Obligations Secured including all amounts to which we may become entitled under the Mortgage, and\n(ii) You have done everything else you have promised to do in the Agreements and the Mortgage, and\n(iii) We have signed and delivered to you a Release of the Mortgage.\n\nYou may remain in possession of the property as long as you are not in default under any of the Agreements and as long as you meet all your other obligations to us under the Mortgage.\n\n5.

        "text": "(ii) Insurance -- You will insure without delay, and keep insured, in our favour and until the Mortgage is discharged, all buildings and improvements covered by the Mortgage (including those which will be built in the future both during construction and afterwards) (\"the Buildings\") against loss or damage by fire and other perils usually covered in fire insurance policies and against any other perils we request. Such insurance must be provided by a company approved by us for the replacement cost of the Buildings (the maximum amount for which the Buildings can be insured) in Canadian dollars. Your policy must be in form satisfactory to us and must include extended perils coverage and the Canadian standard mortgage clause satisfactory to us stating that loss under the policy is payable to us. You shall, at our request, transfer to us all insurance policies and receipts you have on the Buildings and any proceeds from that insurance. Co-Insurance is not permitted.\n\n11 you do not: 976\n- maintain insurance on the Buildings that, in our opinion, complies with this paragraph;\n- deliver a copy of any insurance policy or receipt to us at our request; or\n- provide us with evidence, at our request, of any renewal or replacement of the insurance, at least fifteen full days before your insurance expires or is terminated,\n\nwe can, but are not obliged to, insure any of the Buildings. What we pay for any insurance we obtain under this paragraph shall be added to the Obligations Secured and will bear interest at the interest rate provided for in the Agreements. You will pay this amount to us immediately. Also, if the insurance you obtain is not acceptable to us in our reasonable estimation, we can require you to replace it with insurance which is acceptable. If any loss or damage occurs, you will provide us immediately, at your expense, with all necessary proofs of claim. You will also do all necessary acts to enable us to obtain payment of insurance proceeds. Our providing a copy of this Mortgage will be sufficient authority for an insurance company to pay us any loss related to the insurance policy or to accept instructions from us dealing with the loss. If the property includes a condominium unit you will seek to ensure the full compliance by the condominium corporation with its duties and obligations under the Condominium Act and the Declaration and By-Laws of the condominium corporation.\n\nInsurance proceeds may, to the extent permitted by law, in whole or in part and, at our option, be applied to rebuild or repair the damaged Buildings or paid to you or paid to any other person who owns or did own the property, (as established by the registered title) or applied, at our sole discretion, to reduce any part of the Obligations Secured, whether due or not yet due.\n\n(iii) Taxes -- You agree to pay all taxes on the property when they are due. If we require it, you will make monthly tax payments to us on account of property taxes with each monthly loan payment. The amount of each monthly tax payment will be 1/12th of our estimate of a year's taxes on the property next coming due and payable and may change from time to time to reflect changes in the annual taxes on the property. The monthly tax payments should enable us to pay all taxes on or before their annual due date. Or, if the taxes are payable in instalments, the monthly payments should enable us to pay the full year's instalments of taxes on or before the date on which the first instalment is due.\n\nYou will also pay us, on demand, any amount by which the actual taxes on the property exceed our estimate of your taxes. Or, at our option, we may increase the payment to cover this amount.\n\nWe will apply the monthly payments we receive from you towards payment of your property taxes as long as you are not in default under the Mortgage. We are not obliged to make tax payments on multiple instalment dates or more often than once a year. If you have not paid us enough for taxes, we may, at our option, still pay the taxes. This will create a debit balance in your tax account. Any debit balance is immediately payable by you. We are under no obligation to advise you that a debit balance has been created.\n\nWe will pay you interest on any credit balance in your tax account. The interest we pay will not be less than that paid by us on savings-chequing accounts with the same credit balance. We will charge you interest on the debit balance in your tax account at the interest rate provided for in the Agreements until the debit balance is paid to us in full. Any such debit balance and accrued interest thereon will form a part of the Obligations Secured.\n\nIf you fail to pay us any Obligations Secured when it is due, we may apply the credit balance in your tax account towards payment of the Obligations Secured.\n\nWe can deduct from any advance of the Obligations Secured enough money to pay all taxes due which have not been paid.\n\nYou will immediately send us all assessment notices, tax bills or tax notices which you receive and provide us with receipted tax bills if we require.\n\n(iv) Other charges -- You agree to pay all taxes, charges, mortgages, liens, common expenses and other encumbrances on the property when they are due. If you do not pay any of these amounts when they are due, we can pay them. We can also pay off any liens, claims, common expenses or encumbrances against your property which we consider to have priority over the Mortgage. If we pay on your behalf any taxes, charges, mortgages, liens, other encumbrances or any common expenses, you will immediately pay us our costs of so doing and until paid, all such costs will form part of the Obligations Secured and will bear interest at the interest rate provided for in the Agreements. These costs will include all of our legal expenses on a solicitor and own client basis. All of these costs will form a part of the Obligations Secured and will bear interest at the interest rate provided for in the Agreements.\n\n(v) Keeping the property in good condition -- You agree to keep the property in good condition and to make any repairs that are needed. You also agree not to do anything, or let anyone else do anything, that lowers the value of the property. We can inspect the property at any reasonable time, and charge the cost of any inspections to you. These costs shall be payable to us immediately, shall bear interest as provided for in the Agreements and shall form part of the Obligations Secured.\n\nIf you don't keep the property in good condition, or if you or anyone else does anything that lowers the value of the property, we can make any repairs which we consider necessary and charge our cost of repairs to you. These amounts shall be payable to us immediately, shall bear interest as provided in the Agreements and shall form part of the Obligations Secured. You will not make any alterations, improvements or changes without our prior written consent.\n\nYou will not use the property for any business purposes without our consent.\n(vi) If you are a tenant of the property - You promise:\n- to pay the rents and other amounts due under the lease as they fall due;\n- to comply with all of the other terms of the lease and not to do anything that would cause the lease to be terminated;\n- not to surrender the lease;\n- not to make any change in the lease without first obtaining our written consent;\n- to give us a true copy of any notice or request you receive concerning the lease; and\n- to notify us immediately if your landlord advises you of early termination or takes any steps to effect early termination of the lease.\n\nWe shall have the right to cure any default by you under the lease but are not required to do so. If we cure any default under the lease, you will pay to us all costs we incur, These costs shall! be payable to us immediately, shall bear interest as provided in the Agreements and shall form part of the Obligations Secured.",

If you do not complete the construction, we may do so and our expenses will form a part of the Obligations Secured and will bear interest at the Interest rate provided for in the Agreements. You will pay us these expenses immediately. We will make advances to you based on the progress of the improvement, until either completion and acceptance of the improvement or the amount of the advances reaches the amount agreed to be made available by us and in what amount. Whatever the purpose is of one or more of the Obligations Secured, we may in our sole and absolute discretion hold back funds from advances until we are satisfied that you have complied with the holdback provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act as amended or re-enacted. You authorize us to provide information about the Mortgage to any person claiming a mechanic's lien on the property.\n\n10. Transfer of lesses and rents\n\nAs additional and separate security for the Obligations Secured, you assign to us all existing and future rents and leases relating to the property. In particular you transfer and assign to us as security:\n\n(i) All leases, lease agreements and their renewals;\n(i) All rents and other money payable under the terms of all such leases and agreements. However, we may allow you to receive the rents so long as there is no default by you in making your payments to us or in complying with your other obligations to us under the Mortgage; and\n(iil) All of your rights under such leases and agreements.\n\nIn addition you confirm that:\n\n(i) You must obtain our prior written consent for any future leases of the property or for the renewal of any lease (other than a renewal provided for in any lease);\n(ii) Nothing we do under this paragraph shall put us in possession of the property;\n(iii) However, if you default under the Mortgage, we have the right to take possession of the property, inspect, collect rents or manage the property; and\n(iv) We are not obliged to collect any rent or other income from the property nor to comply with any term of any lease or agreement.\n\n11. Appointing a Receiver to Receive Income\n\nIf you default in making any regular loan payment or any other payment which you have agreed to make to us, or in complying with any of your obligations under any Agreement or the Mortgage, we can, in writing, appoint a receiver (which includes a receiver and manager) to collect any income from the property. We can also, in writing, appoint a new receiver in place of any receiver appointed by us. The receiver is considered to be your agent and not ours and his defaults are considered to be solely your defaults.\n\nThe receiver has the right to:\n\n(i) Use any available remedy (taken in your name or our name) to collect the income from the property;\n(ii) Take possession of the property or part of it;\n(iii) Manage the property, maintain it in good condition and complete any construction or improvements if applicable; and\n(iv) Lease the property on whatever terms considered appropriate.\n\nFrom the income collected the receiver may:\n\n(i) Retain a commission of 5\\% of the total money received or any higher rate permitted by a judge or other authorized officer.\n(ii) Retain enough money to pay disbursements spent on collecting the income.\n(iij) Pay all taxes, fire insurance premiums, expenses of keeping the property in good condition or completing any construction or improvements, interest on those payments and all charges that have priority over the Mortgage and interest on those charges.\n(iv) Pay us all Interest that is due and payable under the Obligations Secured and then, at our option, pay us all or part of the Obligations Secured, whether due or not yet due.\n\nNothing done by the receiver puts us in possession of the property or makes us accountable for any money except for money actually received by us.\n\n12. Environmental Provisions\n\nWe (including, in this section, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation if this is a CMHC-insured mortgage) may inspect the property and the Buildings on it when we consider it appropriate. We may do this for any purpose but particularly to conduct environmental testing, site assessments, investigations or studies which we consider necessary. The costs of any inspection, testing, assessment or study will be payable by you and you will pay us the costs immediately after we give you notice of them. If you do not pay us when we request it, we can add the amounts to the Obligations Secured under your Mortgage and these amounts will bear interest at the interest rate provided for in the Agreements. If we do the things permitted under this section, we will not be considered to be in possession or control of the property.\n\n13. Securitization\n\nWe may, at our option, sell or deposit all or any part of the Obligations Secured, any Agreement or this Mortgage to one or more third party(ies) without notice to you or your consent. If we do so, you agree that this Mortgage shall continue to secure all Obligations Secured, including all amounts owing under any Obligations Secured or Agreement that has been so sold, or assigned or deposited and all Obligations Secured that arise under any Agreement after such sale, assignment or deposit. This Mortgage and any Obligations Secured or Agreement once sold, assigned or deposited may be repurchased by us, whether or not in default.\n\n14. Immediate Payment\n\nYou will immediately, at our option, pay to us all of the Obligations Secured if any part of the Obligations Secured is not paid when it is due, or if you fail to comply with any of your obligations under the Mortgage or under any Agreement.\n\n15.

        "text": "16. Enforcing our Rights\n\nIf you do not repay the Obligations Secured after we have demanded payment of them or if you have not corrected any other default under this Mortgage or Agreements we can take immediate possession of your property. Upon giving you notice as required by law, we may sell the property or lease it or pursue any other remedy available to us under Nova Scotia law. You will immediately pay all our expenses of enforcing or protecting our security or any of our rights under the Mortgage or any Agreements. Our expenses include our costs of taking or keeping possession of the property, an allowance for the time and services of our employees utilized in doing, our legal fees on a solicitor and own client basis and all other costs related to protecting or enforcing our interest under the Mortgage. These expenses will form part of the Obligations Secured and will bear interest as provided for in the Agreements. If the amount we receive from the sale or lease of the property is less than what you owe under the Obligations Secured you will have to pay us the difference.\n\nYou agree not to make any claims concerning the property against anyone who buys it or leases it from us, or anyone who buys or leases the property after that time. If you do have any claims concerning the property, you agree to make them only against us and only for money damages.\n\nIf we obtain a court judgement against you for your failure to comply with any of your obligations to us under any of the Agreements or the Mortgage, the judgement will not result in a merger of the terms of the judgement with our other remedies or rights to enforce your other obligations under the Mortgage. We will continue to be entitled to receive interest on the Obligations Secured in the manner established in the Agreement(s). The rate of interest payable on any judgement shall be calculated and payable in the same way as interest is calculated under the Agreement(s) and at the same rate that interest is payable until the judgement has been paid in full.\n\n17. Sale of Property\n\nIf you sell or transfer the property then, at our option, you will immediately pay to us all the Obligations Secured. If we do not require you to pay to us the Obligations Secured, your obligations to us under the Mortgage, and our rights against you or anyone else who is liable for the payment of the Obligations Secured, are not affected.\n\n18. Amendments\n\nWe may from time to time enter into one or more written agreements with you (or with anyone to whom the property is transferred) to amend the Agreements or the Mortgage. It will not be necessary to register the agreement on title in order to retain priority for the Mortgage, as amended, over any instrument registered after the Mortgage for the full amount of the Obligations Secured. Any reference in this set of Standard Mortgage Terms to the Mortgage means the Mortgage as amended by any such agreement.\n\n19. Giving Notice\n\nAny written notice under this Mortgage or the Agreements may be given to you and shall be considered to have been received by you when we send it to the last address of which we have received written notice from you. Written notice to any one of you shall be considered to be notice to all of you. Written notice shall be considered to have been received by us when it is received at the address of the branch indicated on the Mortgage document or any other branch as we may notify you in writing.\n\n20. Effect on other agreements, obligations and security\n\nThe Mortgage does not change or release you from any of your other obligations under the Agreements with us. Also, the Mortgage does not affect any other security we hold for the repayment of the Obligations Secured, or any other rights we may have to enforce repayment of the Obligations Secured.\n\n21. Condominium Provisions\n\nThe Condominium Act, as amended or re-enacted, is called \"the Act\". Expressions used below which are the same as those in the Act have the same meaning as those in the Act, except that the expression condominium property has the same meaning as the word \"property\" in the Act.\n\nYou will comply with the Act, and with the declaration, by-laws and rules of the condominium corporation (the corporation) relating to the property and provide us with proof of your compliance from time to time as we may request.\n\nYou will pay the common expenses for your property to the corporation on the due dates. In addition to our other rights and remedies contained in the Mortgage, you will pay us immediately all our expenses in relation to any by-law, resolution, rule or other matter (other than one for which only a vote of the majority present at the meeting is required) or the enforcement of our right to have the corporation or any owner comply with the Act, declaration, by-laws and rules and our exercising any voting rights we may have.\n\nThese costs will bear interest in accordance with the Agreements and will form a part of the Obligations Secured.\n\nYou irrevocably authorize us to exercise your rights in all matters concerning the Act and the condominium. You also authorize us to exercise your rights to demand the corporation purchase the unit and common interest, where provided under the Act; elect to have the value of the unit and common interest or that of the condominium property determined by arbitration and receive your share of the corporation's assets and the proceeds from the sale of the unit and common interest or of the condominium property or any part of the common elements.\n\nIf we do not exercise your rights, you may do so according to any instructions we may give you. Before making such a demand or election you must obtain our prior written approval. You must do this even if we do not have the right to make the demand or election as between ourselves and the corporation, and even if we had previously arranged for you to exercise that right.\n\nThe above actions will not put us in possession of the property. We are not liable for any action we may take in doing what you have authorized us to do or for any failure to act.\n\nYou authorize us to inspect the corporation's records and remedy any failure of yours to comply with the Act or the declaration, by-laws and rules of the corporation. You will forward to us, if we require, any notices, assessments, by-laws, rules and financial statements of the corporation you receive (or are entitled to receive) from the corporation.\n\nThe Obligations Secured will become payable immediately, at our option, if (i) the corporation fails to comply with the Act and the declaration, by-laws and rules of the corporation; (ii) the corporation fails to insure all the condominium units and common elements according to law and according to any additional requirements of ours or do all that is necessary to collect insurance proceeds; (iii) the corporation makes any substantial modification to the common elements or the corporation's assets without our approval; (iv) there has been substantial damage and the owners have voted for termination of the condominium; (v) a sale of the condominium property or any part of the common elements is authorized, or (vi) the property ceases to be governed by the Act.",

We can also execute all documents and do all acts needed to carry out the partition. Your share of the corporation's assets and the proceeds from the sale of the unit and common interest of or of the condominium property or any part of the common elements shall be paid to us (unless we notify you to the contrary in writing) and you will do all things necessary to accomplish this and any money received by us (after payment of all our expenses) may be applied to reduce any part of the Obligations Secured. Any balance remaining after all claims have been satisfied will be paid by us.\n\n22. Releasing the Property from the Mortgage\n\nWe may release, or partially release, the property from the Mortgage whether we receive value for our release or not. If we release part of the property from the Mortgage at any time, the rest of the property will continue to secure the Obligations Secured.\n\nIf the property is subdivided before our interest in the property comes to an end, the Mortgage will be secured by each part into which the property is subdivided. This means that each part will secure repayment of the total amount of the Obligations Secured you owe us, even if we release another part of the property from the Mortgage.\n\nWe can release you, any guarantor, or any other person from performing any obligation contained in the Mortgage or any other security document without releasing any part of the property secured by the Mortgage or any other security document. Any such release shall not release any other party from their obligations under the Mortgage or Agreements.\n\n23. Release of Mortgage\n\nWhen our interest in the property comes to an end, we will prepare for you a full release of our claim (which is called a Release of Mortgage). You will give us a reasonable time in which to prepare and sign the release and you will pay our usual administrative fee for preparing, reviewing or signing the document and, all legal and other expenses we incur in so doing. You will be responsible for registering and for the coste of registering any release.\n\n24. Who it bound by the Mortgage\n\nYou agree to observe and be bound by all of the terms and obligations contained in the Mortgage. The Mortgage will also be binding on your heirs, personal representatives and any person to whom the property is transferred, and shall benefit us and our successors and assigns. All persons who sign or who are otherwise bound by the Mortgage as mortgagors are jointly and severally bound to comply with all obligations under the Mortgage.\n\n25. Cuarantee\n\nIn this paragraph, guarantor means each person who signs the Mortgage as guarantor of the Obligations Secured. Mortgagor means each person who signs or is otherwise bound by the Mortgage as mortgagor.\n\nIn return for us making a loan to the mortgagor, the guarantor, by signing the Mortgage, unconditionally guarantees to us the mortgagor's payments of the Obligations Secured (including interest, whether or not the interest rate is changed, and other costs and charges), when due and compliance with the mortgagor's other obligations under the Mortgage and Agreements. Each guarantor agrees that, if the mortgagor defaults in making any payment or in performing any other obligation under the Mortgage or Agreements, the guarantor will pay us upon demand all of the Obligations Secured and comply with all of the obligations under the Mortgage or Agreements which have not been complied with by the mortgagor. Each guarantor will be jointly and severally responsible with the mortgagor and with one another (if more than one) for all obligations under the Mortgage and Agreements, including payment of the Obligations Secured.\n\nIt is understood that we can without releasing or lessening the guarantor's liability and without obtaining the consent of or giving notice to the guarantor:\n\n- Make new advances of the Obligations Secured;\n- Grant any extensions of time for payment and extensions of the term of the Obligations Secured, including any amendments, replacements, additions or renewals of the Agreements covering the Obligations Secured;\n- Increase the rate of Interest payable under the Agreements, either during the initial term or in any subsequent renewal period;\n- Release the whole or any part of the property from the Mortgage or any other security;\n- Otherwise deal with the mortgagor, any other person (including any guarantor), any security (including the Mortgage) or the property, including releasing, realizing on or replacing any security we may hold;\n- Waive any provision of the Mortgage or Agreements or change any of the terms of the Mortgage or Agreements at any time;\n\neither before or after requiring payment from any other person. We may require payment from any guarantor without first trying to collect from the mortgagor or any other person (including any guarantor) or on any security (including the Mortgage). The obligations of the guarantor under this guarantee shall be as principal debtor and not as surety and are not affected by the release of any mortgagor or any other person (including any guarantor) of its obligations under the Obligations Secured or any compromise or termination of any Obligations Secured, whether in bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise. Each guarantor's obligations shall be binding upon the guarantor's successors or personal representatives.\n\n26. Headings\n\nThe headings in the body of the Mortgage form no part of the Mortgage. They are inserted for convenience only. You agree that all of the provisions stated in this set of Standard Mortgage Terms form a part of the Mortgage.",
