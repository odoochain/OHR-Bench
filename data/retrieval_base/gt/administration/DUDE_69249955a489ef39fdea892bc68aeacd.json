        "text": "- Group insurance contracts - including group contracts covering group life, optional and dependant life, creditor insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, disability, and critical illness; but not including group contracts covering the health care costs of insured individuals (see health insurance under section 2 - Non-taxable Insurance Contracts for more information).\n\nThe following are examples of insurance contracts that are subject to RST when sold to a Manitoba resident:\n- Identity theft insurance.\n- Executor insurance.\n- Balance protection insurance.\n- Mortgage protection insurance - regardless of where the property is located.\n- Trip cancellation insurance.\n- Baggage insurance.\n\nInsurance contracts subject to proration\n\n- Taxable insurance contracts that relate to risks, perils and events that may occur both inside and outside of Manitoba are taxable on the portion that relates to Manitoba. The allocation to Manitoba is to be determined on the basis that is most reasonable in the circumstances, such as:\n- the insured value of property in Manitoba as a percentage of the total value of the property insured in all jurisdictions;\n- for contracts covering employees both inside and outside Manitoba, the portion that covers Manitoba based employees only;\n- an allocation by revenue per province for business interruption insurance;\n- for goods in transit, the percentage of travel in Manitoba in comparison with the total amount travelled; (for trucking firms, the amount declared as their Manitoba prorate percentage for the International Registration Plan can be used).\n\nExample: If cargo insurance is purchased on goods in transit and 85\\% of the travel occurs in Manitoba and 15\\% occurs outside of the province, 85\\% of the premiums paid in regards to the cargo insurance are taxable. RST applies regardless of whether the owner of the goods or the transportation company is resident in Manitoba or not.\n\nTaxable and non-taxable coverages\n\n- Where insurance contracts contain both taxable and non-taxable coverages, the value of each component must be segregated in the billing to the customer, with tax applied to the taxable coverages. If this is not done, RST applies on the entire contract value.\n\nExample: A person insures a house in Manitoba and a cottage in Ontario under one policy. RST does not apply on the insurance that relates to the Ontario cottage if the coverage is segregated in the insurance contract.",

        "text": "Fees \n\n- Except as noted in the points below, the total of all fees and charges that are invoiced to a customer in connection with a taxable insurance contract are subject to tax. Taxable charges include: administration fees, placement fees, risk consultation fees, as well as service fees that may be charged by insurance brokers when they do not receive a commission from the insurance carrier.\n\nPlease Note: Fees or charges relating to the purchase of non-taxable insurance contracts are likewise not taxable. If the fees or charges apply to both taxable and exempt insurance contracts, they are subject to tax in proportion to the taxable insurance component.\n- Financing fees that may be applied when customers opt to pay by instalments (rather than in full at the time of renewal) are not taxable.\n- NSF fees are not taxable.\n- Commission fees paid to insurance brokers by insurance companies are not subject to tax.\n- Administration fees charged by insurance companies to administer self-insured group policies are not taxable.\n\nWhen is tax payable?\n\n- For taxable insurance contracts with a definite term (excluding group contracts) - RST is payable on all new or renewal contracts that come into effect after July 14, 2012. RST is considered to be collected by the vendor, on the full contract price, on the first day that the contract coverage comes into effect.\n\nFor example: For a property insurance contract pre-billed August 15, 2012, for the period October 14, 2012 to October 13, 2013, the RST is considered collected on the full contract price by the vendor on October 14, 2012 regardless of whether the premium was paid prior to that date or after as instalments. A monthly vendor will report and remit the tax with their October 2012 RST return, due November 20, 2012 (quarterly vendors would report and remit the tax with their return due January 21, 2013).\n- For taxable insurance contracts with an indefinite term and for group insurance contracts - All premiums that are payable and that relate entirely to a coverage period after July 14, 2012 are subject to RST.\n\nFor example: The premiums for a group life insurance for the period of August 1, 2012 to August 31, 2012 are invoiced on July 10, 2012. No RST applies. However, if the premiums are invoiced on July 20, 2012 for the same August period, RST is applicable.\n- Please Note: If a taxable insurance contract is purchased from a nonregistered vendor, the purchaser must calculate and remit the RST directly to the Taxation Division. If the purchaser is registered with an RST number, the tax must be reported as tax on purchases on the next RST vendor's return and paid along with any tax collected. For non-registered purchasers, a Casual Purchaser's Return must be completed and forwarded to the Taxation Division with the tax payable by the $20^{\\text {th }}$ of the following month.",

        "text": "Insurance contract refunds and amendments\n- When a taxable insurance contract that begins after July 14, 2012 is cancelled or the coverage is reduced before the end of the term, any refunded insurance premiums should include an amount for RST. The tax that is refundable is based on the refundable insurance premiums.\n\nFor example: A taxable insurance contract valued at $\\$ 1,000$ is entered into on November 1, 2012. The total payable for the contract including RST is $\\$ 1,070$. Part way through the coverage period, the contract is cancelled and $\\$ 400$ of the insurance premium is refundable. RST of $\\$ 28(\\$ 400 \\times 7 \\%)$ is also refundable, for a total refund amount of $\\$ 428$. The vendor of the contract can deduct the RST refunded from the tax collected in the period and remit the net amount.\n\nPlease Note: RST refunds (which include amounts deducted from tax collected) are subject to a two year limitation from the date the amount was received as tax.\n- When insurance contracts are amended after July 14, 2012 to increase coverage, RST applies on any additional premium that relates to taxable insurance coverage.\n\nPlease Note: Tax will apply on the additional taxable premiums even if the insurance contract was entered into before July 15, 2012.\n- For insurance contracts that are issued on a refund basis, such as group insurance contracts, RST is to be calculated on the amount refunded and included in the refund amount in the same manner as illustrated in the example above.\n\nSection 2 - NON-TAXABLE INSURANCE CONTRACTS\n\nNon-taxable insurance contracts\n\nRST does not apply on the following insurance contracts:\n(Please Note: For insurance types denoted with an asterisk (*), a signed statement supporting the exemption must be obtained by the vendor each time a contract is entered into or renewed - see page 6 for more information).\n- Reinsurance contracts.\n- Self-insurance.\n- Insurance in respect of the life of an insured individual, or the lives of an insured individual and his or her family members under a single life insurance contract (excluding group life insurance and creditor insurance).\n\nPlease Note: If a life insurance contract, as described above, is sold with a taxable insurance component included (ex. disability insurance), the entire contract can be sold exempt if less than $10 \\%$ of the contract relates to taxable insurance. Otherwise, the exempt life insurance coverage must be segregated for the exemption to apply.\n- Health insurance (individual or group) covering the health care costs of insured individuals; including health care equipment, dental care,",

It also includes primary coverages for vehicles not eligible for all perils coverage under Basic Autopac, such as large trucks over $16,330 \\mathrm{~kg}$ and public service buses. These coverages can be purchased exempt from any vendor, including Manitoba Public Insurance and any other insurance company.\n\nPlease Note: Insurance for vehicles that are not registered under The Drivers and Vehicles Act is taxable. For example, an ATV that is only used on a person's property would be insured as part of the owner's taxable household property insurance.\n- Insurance contracts, including aircraft hull and aviation liability insurance, purchased for the following types of aircrafts:\n- state aircraft registered under The Aeronautics Act (Canada),\n- commercial aircraft registered under The Aeronautics Act (Canada) used solely for transporting passengers or goods for gain as an air service licensed under The Canada Transportation Act,\n- aircraft specifically designed and licensed for farm spraying*.\n- Insurance contracts for commercial fishing boats when purchased by a holder of a commercial fishing license under The Fisheries Act (Canada)*.\n- Insurance contracts for sea-going vessels under The Marine Insurance Act.

Insurance coverage paid by government employees (i.e. under taxable group plans) is also not eligible for exemption.\n- Contracts covering farming and farm property when the insured property is owned or leased by a person engaged in the business of farming*. The business of farming means the growing of field crops, primary production of food, and raising of livestock on farmland for commercial sale and as the primary source of income for the operator. This exemption includes contracts for the following:\n- farm buildings and structures,\n- farm implements and farm machinery that are RST-exempt (see Bulletin 018 - Farm-Use Equipment and Other Items for further information),\n- bloodstock or livestock insurance to insure livestock against loss through death, sickness, accident and theft,\n- crop insurance,\n- hail insurance.\n(Hobby farms are excluded from this exemption, those being farms generally operated for recreation, without the expectation of profit and not as the primary source of income for the owner).\n\nPlease Note: Where a single insurance contract that covers farming and farm property also covers residential dwellings or taxable equipment located on the farm property, no RST applies on the full contract. RST does apply if a separate contract covers the residential dwellings or equipment.\n- Insurance contracts purchased by providers of custom farming services that cover RST-exempt farm implements and machinery and related liability (see Bulletin 018 - Farm-Use Equipment and Other Items for further information). Insurance on their land, buildings and other equipment is taxable.\n\nStatements required to support exemptions\n- Statements containing the following information must be obtained to support exemptions for certain purchasers of insurance:\n\nFarmers and custom farming service providers:\n- purchaser's name,\n- land description, and\n- a signed statement certifying that the insurance relates to their farm property and farming activities.",

See Bulletin 030 - Summary of Taxable and Exempt Goods and Services for additional information.\n- If taxable goods or services are purchased from an unregistered supplier (such as a supplier located outside Manitoba), RST must be reported as tax on purchases and paid on the next RST vendor return. Tax is payable on the full laid-down cost of the taxable goods or services in Manitoba (including exchange, transportation, customs and duties, but not GST).\n\nInsurance claims\nWhen taxable goods and services are purchased in connection with an insurance claim, RST applies. For example: When restoration services are purchased to clean or repair damaged furniture as part of a claim, the service provider is required to collect tax on the service.\n\nSection 4 - REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS\n\nRegistration requirements\n- Insurance companies must register to collect and remit RST on insurance premiums invoiced and collected by them directly.\n\nAn insurance company's obligations as a vendor may be fulfilled by having the agents or brokers selling their contracts collect and remit the tax on their behalf. However, as insurance contracts are between the insurance company and the customer, the insurance company is responsible for the collection and remittance of tax on contracts where a broker or agent does not collect the tax.\n- Insurance brokers, agents and third party administrators must register to collect and remit RST on contracts where they invoice and collect the premiums.\n- Reciprocal exchange groups, associations and fraternal societies that sell taxable insurance contracts must register to collect and remit tax on the",
