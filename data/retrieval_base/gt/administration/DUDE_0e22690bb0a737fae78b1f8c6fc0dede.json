The substituted measurements preserve the effect of the original provisions except to the extent necessary to obtain amounts expressed in convenient and suitable terms.\n\nRegulation 3 provides that the amendments do not relate to plant which was in existence immediately before the coming into operation of these regulations if the dimensions of that plant complied with the then existing requirements.\n\nThese regulations implement the provisions of EC Directive 80/181/EEC (O.J. No. L39, 15.2.80, p. 40) on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement.",
