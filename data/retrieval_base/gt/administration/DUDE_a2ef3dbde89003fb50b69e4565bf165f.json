These returns were prepared on the basis of the information put at our disposal.\n\nPage 8 of the original corporate income tax return and page 1 of the tax credit for investment must be signed by a legal representative of the company. The signed returns must then be sent to the following address:\n\n\nAdministration des Contributions Directes \\\\ Bureau d'imposition - Sociétés V \\\\ 18, rue du Fort Wedell \\\\ L-2982 Luxembourg\n\n\nIn addition, could you please send us a copy of the tax assessments for the taxable year 2011 as soon as you receive them, so that we can verify that they match the filed returns?\n\nPlease note that if it is necessary to file an appeal against the assessments, the latter has to be introduced within the legal term of three months after receipt of the assessments.\n\nWith respect to these corporate tax returns, we would like to draw your attention on the following items:\n\n1. Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and Municipal Business Tax (MBT)\n\nBased on the 2011 financial statements, the company realized a commercial profit amounting to EUR 63,559,665. This result has to be adjusted by the non deductible tax charges (EUR 26,603,081). Consequently, the taxable basis of the company should amount to EUR 90,162,746.",

        "text": "The company should benefit from a tax credit for investment amounting to EUR 13,710. This tax credit reduces the CIT due for the year.\n\nThe company should therefore be liable to a CIT of EUR $19,867,165$ and a MBT of EUR $6,084,801$ for the fiscal year 2011.\n\nAs mentioned in the 2010 tax file, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that some of the investments could be eligible to a tax credit for investment (i.e. acquisition of hardware) but we had to exclude them as the amortization period was less than three years. Indeed, article 152bis of the Luxembourg Income Tax Law states that all investments made by Luxembourg tax payers in depreciable tangible assets (except in buildings) are eligible to the tax credit provided that they are depreciated over a period of at least three years. As a consequence we would recommend you to reconsider the amortization period of all your investments in hardware in the future to be able to benefit from this tax credit.\n\nFurthermore, we noted that the depreciation table does not totally match with the note 3 \"Fixed assets\" of the annual accounts (e.g. total of the acquisition cost, total of the acquisitions of the year,...). Therefore, please note that the tax administration could request additional information about these differences.\n\n2. Net Wealth Tax (NWT)\n\nAs a general rule, the NWT basis is the \"unitary value\" of the company on 1 January each year. The unitary value is determined by the difference between the assets and the liabilities against third parties.\n\nAccording to our computation and as confirmed by the tax authorities, the unitary value of the company as of 1 January 2011 should amount to EUR $85,014,000$. Consequently, the company should be liable to a NWT of EUR 425,070 for the year 2011.\n\nAs for the previous years, we have assumed that you intend to benefit from the NWT reduction for the year 2011. We remind you that in order to benefit from this reduction, the company has to create a special reserve amounting to five times the NWT due for the year (i.e. EUR $2,125,350$ to be created in the 2012 accounts). Moreover, the company has to keep this special reserve in the accounts during five years following the accounting year of reduction (i.e. until 24 September 2016).\n\nPlease note that if those conditions are not fulfilled, the NWT will be due to the Luxembourg authorities.\n\nFor the determination of the unitary value for the year 2012 (based on the accounts as at 24 September 2011), please note that we have not deducted the deferred income of EUR 161,833,999 as we understand that this amount does not constitute liabilities to third parties. We understand it relates to actual sales which are deferred in the income statement of future years (see e-mail of Mrs Maeve Hoey dated 9 May 2012). This should however not change the NWT position of the company, i.e. no NWT should be due for $2012^{1}$.\n\n3. Chamber of Commerce\n\nWe would like to inform you that the contribution to the \"Chambre de Commerce\" for the year 2013, which is computed on the 2011 CIT basis before tax losses, if any, should amount to EUR 158,163.\n\n\n${ ^{1}$ Provided that the CIT charge for 2012 will be at least equal to the theoretical NWT charge (KEUR 1550 ) and that a special reserve of five times this amount will be constituted in the accounts of fiscal year 2013.\n}",

Remarks\n- We understand that no transfer pricing study has been performed for the Luxembourg company and that no advance pricing agreement has been discussed with the Luxembourg tax authorities. We recommend you to collect as much documentation as possible in order to provide the Luxembourg tax authorities with the most appropriate information, in case they raise some specific questions.\n- We have assumed that the arm's length principle has been respected regarding the transactions between related parties realised in 2011.\n- We understand that no director's fees were paid to the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nBased on the above mentioned comments, we estimate the tax charge for the year 2011 as follows:\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr} \nAmounts in EUR & Estimated tax charges & Accounted tax charges & Difference \\\\\nCorporate Income Tax (CIT) & $19,867,165$ & $25,965,685$ & $6,098,520$ \\\\\nMunicipal Business Tax (MBT) & $6,084,801$ & 0 & $(6,084,801)$ \\\\\nNet Wealth Tax (NWT) (*) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nTotal & $25,951,966$ & $25,965,685$ & $(13,719)$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n(*) Taking into account the NWT reduction\n\nWe remain at your entire disposal if you need any further information.\n\nYours sincerely,",

If during this period the purchase price of these assets exceeds EUR 250,000, the calculation bases for the respective tax credits are reduced to the threshold of EUR 250,000. The following should not be considered as assets invested for the purpose of a first establishment: the block acquisition of an enterprise, an autonomous part or a fraction of an enterprise in return for attribution to the assignor of a direct or indirect shareholding in the newly incorporated enterprise or where the assignor has a direct or indirect shareholding in the newly incorporated enterprise, second-hand assets that were previously covered by a leasing agreement which was granting the benefit of the tax credits for the lessor;\n3. individual assets acquired free of charge;\n4. motorised vehicles, except:\na) those assigned exclusively to the business of transporting persons or forming part of the net assets of a car rental company;\nb) those assigned exclusively to the transport of goods or merchandise;\nc) those assigned exclusively within an enterprise to the transport of employees to or from their place of work, provided that such vehicles are allowed to circulate with a capacity of at least nine occupants (including the driver);\nd) those specially fitted out exclusively for use as a breakdown/repair service\ne) self-propelled machinery.\n(3) Where the enterprise was acquired free of charge or by a similar mean for the purpose of the realisation of unrevealed capital gains of the enterprise, the acquirer must state the book values of the assignor for the closings prior to their acquisition. If the enterprise acquired in this way was integrated into the enterprise of the taxpayer, see 4 above\n(4) The portion in question is determined using the ratio between the net book value, on the date of transfer, of the assets transmitted and the global net book value of the assignor on the date of transfer. Attach an appendix with the relevant calculations\n(5) The form should not be used for investments in sanitary and central heating installations for hotel buildings.\n(6) The following items are concerned:\n1. tangible depreciable assets other than buildings, agricultural livestock and mineral and fossil deposits;\n2. miscellaneous investments in hotel buildings and investments of a social nature (defined by a regulation relating to the Grand Duchy decree)\n3. investments in the fixed assets referred to in Article 32bis L.I.R.\n\nHowever, the assets listed under (2) 1, 2 and 4 are excluded.\n(7) The tax credit amounts to $7 \\%$ for the first tranche of investment not exceeding EUR 150,000 and $3 \\%$ for the tranche of investment exceeding EUR 150,000.
