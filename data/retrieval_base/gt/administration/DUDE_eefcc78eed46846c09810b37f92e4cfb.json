        "text": "This health plan meets Minimum Creditable Coverage standards and will satisfy the individual mandate that you have health insurance.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS REQUIREMENT TO PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE:\n\nAs of January 1, 2009 the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law requires that Massachusetts residents, eighteen (18) years of age and older, must have health coverage that meets the Minimum Creditable Coverage standards set by the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector, unless waived from the health insurance requirement based on affordability or individual hardship. For more information, call the Connector at 1-877-MA-ENROLL or visit the Connector website (www.mahealthconnector.org).\n\nThis health plan meets Minimum Creditable Coverage standards that are effective January 1, 2016 as part of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law. If you purchase this plan, you will satisfy the statutory requirement that you have health insurance meeting these standards.\n\nTHIS DISCLOSURE IS FOR MINIMUM CREDITABLE COVERAGE STANDARDS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016. BECAUSE THESE STANDARDS MAY CHANGE, REVIEW YOUR HEALTH PLAN MATERIAL EACH YEAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR PLAN MEETS THE LATEST STANDARDS.\n\nIf you have questions about this notice, you may contact the Division of Insurance by calling 1-617-521-7794 or visiting its website at www.mass.gov/doi.\n\nFallon Community Health Plan, Inc.\nThis plan includes the tiered provider network. In this plan, members pay different levels of copayments, coinsurance or deductibles depending on the tier of the provider delivering a covered service or supply. This plan may make changes to a provider's benefit tier annually on July $1^{\\text {st }}$. Please consult the provider directory or visit the provider search tool at fallonhealth.org/gic to determine the tier levels of available providers.\n\nAccess to health care services\n\nThis plan covers emergency care worldwide. When you experience an emergency medical condition, you should go to the nearest emergency room for care or call your local emergency communications system (e.g., police or fire department, or 911 ) to request ambulance transportation.\n\nYou may obtain health care services for an emergency medical condition, including local pre-hospital emergency medical service systems, whenever you have an emergency medical condition which in the judgment of a prudent layperson would require pre-hospital emergency medical services, and we will provide coverage of emergency services from any provider.\n\nEmergency services will be covered from all providers at the cost level of the lowest cost-sharing tier regardless of the tier in which the health benefit plan has classified the provider providing such emergency services within the Tiered Provider Network including for inpatient deductibles if the insured seeking or receiving emergency services is subsequently admitted.",

This second bill from the hospital to your insurance company is called a facility fee.\nFallon Health/Fallon: Also referred to as \"the plan,\" \"us,\" \"we\" and \"our\".\nSelect Care service area: The geographical area served by Select Care.

        "text": "Technology Assessment Criteria: Fallon maintains a formal mechanism for evaluating medical technologies through our Technology assessment committee. The committee includes physician administrators, practicing physicians from the plan's service area, and plan staff. When necessary, the committee seeks the input of specialists or professionals who have expertise in the proposed technology. In all cases, the technology is reviewed against the following technology assessment criteria:\n1. The technology must have final approval from the appropriate government regulatory body. This applies to drugs, devices, biologics, and treatments or procedures that must have final approval to market from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other federal governmental body with authority to regulate the technology. Devices must have final FDA approval for the specific indications under evaluation by Fallon.\n2. The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning the effect of the technology on health outcomes. The evidence should consist of well-designed and well-conducted investigations published in peer-reviewed journals. The quality of the study as well as the results are considered in evaluating the evidence. Opinions by national medical associations, consensus panels, or other technology evaluation bodies are evaluated according to the scientific quality of the supporting evidence.\n3. The evidence must show that the technology improves health outcomes. Specifically, the technology's beneficial effects on health outcomes should outweigh any harmful effects on health outcomes.\n4. The technology must be at least as effective as the established technology. In addition, the technology must be as cost-effective as any established alternatives that achieve a similar health outcome.\n5. The outcome must be attainable outside investigational settings.\n\nTerminal illness: An illness as a result of which a member has a life expectancy of less than six months.\nTier: Different levels in which plan specialists and hospitals are placed based on quality and cost-efficiency measures.\n\nUrgent care: Medical care that is needed right away for minor emergencies, such as cuts that require stitches, a sprained ankle or abdominal pain.\n\nUsual, customary and reasonable charge: An amount that is consistent with the normal range of charges for the same or similar services in the geographical area where the service was provided, as determined by the plan.\n\nWalk In Clinic: Limited service medical clinics. Services are provided for a variety of common illnesses such as strep throat, bronchitis, minor rashes and burns and ear, eye and sinus infections. Services are also provided for routine immunizations and preventative health screenings.",

        "text": "Understanding your health care coverage\n\nFallon Health is a health maintenance organization (HMO) that provides health care coverage for its members through a network of health care professionals and hospitals. Fallon is incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a nonprofit organization, and qualifies under federal law as a health maintenance organization. Our administrative offices are located at Chestnut Place, 10 Chestnut St., Worcester, MA 01608.\n\nAs an HMO, Fallon requires you to use specific physicians, hospitals and other providers that are part of your plan. Understanding how your health plan works is important. For one thing, it helps you know what to expect. The following information highlights the most important points about how we work to ensure that you receive quality care and services.\n\nImportant points to remember:\n- The Select Care provider network includes providers in Berkshire, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk and Worcester Counties. In order for you to receive coverage for most services, care must be coordinated by your primary care provider (PCP) and administered by a provider in the Fallon network.\n- When you join Fallon, you choose a primary care provider (PCP) who coordinates your health care.\n- Fallon requires prior authorization for certain services and the site of where those services will be provided.\n\nTier 1, 2 and 3 measurements for plan physicians and hospitals\n\nFallon is committed to giving all our members access to a network of high-quality, cost-efficient plan doctors and hospitals. Fallon Select Care tiers Cardiologists, Endocrinologists, ENTs/Otolaryngologists, Nephrologists, Neurologists, Ob/Gyns, Pulmonologists and Rheumatologists based on quality and cost-efficiency measures. The following specialties are tiered on cost-efficiency measures only: gastroenterology, hematology/oncology, orthopedics, allergy/immunology, urology and podiatry. All other specialists are not tiered and have a $\\$ 60$ copay. Select Care also tiers hospitals based on cost efficiency. The tiering works are as follows:\n\nTier $1^{* * *}$ (Excellent): Plan specialists and hospitals practicing at an excellent level of quality and/or cost-efficiency. You will pay the lowest copayment when you see a Tier 1 specialist or hospital.\nTier 2 ** (Good): Plan specialists and hospitals practicing at a good level of quality and/or costefficiency. You will pay the prevalent, mid-level copayment when you see a Tier 2 specialists or hospital.\nTier 3 * (Standard): Plan specialists and hospitals practicing at a standard level of quality and/or costefficiency. You will pay a higher copayment when you see a Tier 3 specialist or hospital.\n\nNT/ID: This designation includes specialists that did not have sufficient data for tiering and providers that belong to a specialty or subspecialty that is not being tiered by Fallon. These providers are subject to a $\\$ 60$ copayment.\n- You may change your PCP at any time.\n- A referral is not required to see a Reliant Medical Group specialist if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP.\n- For other covered services, you should obtain a referral from your PCP, and in some cases, your physician will obtain authorization from the health plan.\n- Fallon maintains a formulary, or a list of medications, approved for coverage.",

        "text": "Choosing a primary care provider (PCP)\n\nWhen you join Fallon, you must choose a plan provider as your primary care provider (PCP). Your relationship with your PCP is very important, because he or she will work with us to provide or arrange most of your health care.\n\nPCP choices\n\nEach covered family member should choose his or her own PCP. This provider can be a:\n- Family practice doctor (for members of all ages)\n- Doctor of internal medicine (for members over 18)\n- Pediatrician (for members under 18)\n- Doctor of geriatric medicine\n- Doctor of adolescent medicine\n- A nurse practitioner (in appropriate primary care provider specialty listed above)\n- Physician assistant (must be in a primary care practice)\n\nThe Select Care Provider Network directory contains the names of plan providers who are available as PCPs, along with their address, admitting hospital(s) and tiering level. If you haven't selected a PCP and you don't have a plan provider list, Customer Service will send you a free directory, or provide you with further information on plan providers. You can also visit our website at fallonhealth.org/gic to obtain names of plan providers in your area.\n\nYou may change your PCP at any time by either calling Customer Service or completing the \"Change provider\" form on fallonhealth.org/gic.\n\nMake an appointment\n\nOnce you have selected a PCP, please notify Customer Service of your selection. It's also a good idea to schedule an initial appointment. This will allow your PCP to learn about you and your medical history and to begin assisting you with the coordination of any medical care that you may need. He or she can also help you with questions on\n- Preventive care\n- Prescriptions\n- Specialty care\n- Urgent care services\n- Management of your ongoing medical needs\n\nKeep your PCP's phone number handy\n\nIt's also a good idea to keep your PCP's telephone number in your wallet and at home by your phone. If you need to see someone right away, your PCP (or an on-call provider) will direct you. Plan providers' telephones are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week for emergencies and urgent care needs.\n\nFallon requires the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in our network and who is available to accept you or your family members. Until you make this designation, Fallon designates one for you. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, contact the Fallon Customer Service at 1-866-344-4442 (TRS 711) or visit our website at fallonhealth.org/gic to obtain a list of PCPs in your area. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.",

        "text": "Obtaining specialty care and services\n\nWhen you have health care concerns, a good place to start is by contacting your PCP. Much of the time your PCP can provide the care that you need. Sometimes, however, you may need specialty care or services that your PCP does not provide.\n\nIf you and your PCP decide that a visit with a network specialist is medically necessary, your PCP will make the arrangements for you. For some services, your PCP is authorized to give you a referral to see a specialist. (See PCP referral.) For other services, your PCP must get authorization from the plan before giving you the referral. (See \"Plan prior authorization\" below.) If you receive services from any doctor, hospital or other health care provider without getting a referral from your PCP, you will have to pay for these services yourself (with the exception of those services listed under Self-referral below).\n\nWhen you joined Fallon, you chose Select Care. This means that you must use the health care professionals and facilities in the Select Care network. Remember, your copayments for physician specialist visits are determined by the specialist's tiering level. You will pay the lowest copayment when you see a Tier $1^{* * *}$ (excellent) specialty physician. You will pay the prevalent, mid-level copayment when you see a Tier 2 ** (good) specialty physician. You will pay a higher copayment when you see a Tier 3 * (standard) specialty physician.\n\nNote: Please be aware that specialty physician's tiering levels will be re-evaluated on an annual basis. The reevaluation may result in a change in the specialty physician's tiering level; this change takes effect annually on July 1. You should check the annual provider directory or the GIC member portal at fallonhealth.org/gic for annual tiering level changes to specialty physicians.\n\nSelf-referral\n\nIn certain instances, you can \"self-refer\" to a Select Care network specialist. This means that you can call the specialist and make the appointment yourself. You do not need a referral from your PCP, but you must see a Select Care network provider.\n\nServices you can self-refer for:\n- Office visits with a Select Care network obstetrician, gynecologist, certified nurse-midwife or family practitioner, including annual preventive gynecological examination and any subsequent gynecological services determined to be necessary as a result of such examination; services for acute or emergent gynecological conditions; and maternity care. It does not include inpatient admissions or infertility treatment (unless provided by a Reliant Medical Group specialist and you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP).\n- Office visits with a Reliant Medical Group specialist (physician, physician assistant, nurse midwife or nurse practitioner only) if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP.\n- Office visits to a Select Care network oral surgeon for extraction of impacted teeth. (Note: visits to an oral surgeon for any other procedure require authorization)\n- Routine eye examinations with a Select Care network ophthalmologist or optometrist.\n- Outpatient mental health and substance abuse services with network providers. For assistance in finding a network provider, call 1-888-421-8861 (TDD/TTY: 1-781-994-7660).\n- Visit to a contracted limited service clinic (appointments not required).",

        "text": "PCP referral\n\nIn some instances your PCP may refer you to a specialist. Your PCP is responsible to ensure that the provider to whom you are referred is within the Select Care network. In most cases, your PCP will refer you for care with specialists and hospitals with whom they have an affiliation. This helps your PCP coordinate and maintain the quality of your care. This means that the PCP you select determines the specialists and hospitals from whom you will receive care.\n\nIn the rare event that you need specialty care that is not available within your PCP's affiliations, your PCP will refer you to another specialist within the Select Care network. When selecting a specialist for you, your PCP will consider your clinical needs and any active and long-standing relationships with a Select Care network provider.\n\nServices that need a PCP referral, but do not need authorization from the plan:\n- Office visits with a Select Care network specialist, with the exception of office visits with a Reliant Medical Group specialist if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP. In some instances, your PCP may give you a \"standing referral\" to a Select Care network specialist for covered services. For a standing referral, your PCP and specialist must agree on a treatment plan, and the specialist must keep your PCP up to date on your treatment. Standing referrals are valid for up to 12 months, as long as the services are medically necessary.\n- Podiatric care. Your PCP will give you a referral to a Fallon Select Care network podiatrist. The referral is good for a maximum of one year, or until the condition is corrected, whichever comes first.\n- Chiropractic care. Your PCP will give you a referral to a Fallon Select Care network chiropractor which may cover up to 12 visits, if medically necessary.\n- Physical, occupational and speech therapy. Your PCP will provide you with a written order to take to a Fallon Select Care physical, occupational or speech therapist. For physical and occupational therapy, the written order covers medically necessary services up to your benefit maximum.\n\nPlan prior authorization\n\nFor certain types of specialist visits and for certain specialty services, your PCP or specialist will need to obtain authorization from the plan before giving you a referral. An authorization is an assurance by the plan to pay for medically necessary covered services provided by a Fallon Select Care network provider to an eligible plan member.\n\nWhen a service requires authorization, your PCP or specialist will send a request for services to the plan. We will review the request and make an authorization decision within two business days of receipt of all the necessary information. For the purposes of this section, \"necessary information\" may include the results of any face-to-face clinical evaluation or second opinion that may be required. We will inform your PCP of our decision within 24 hours of the time that we make the decision. If we authorize the service, we will send you and your PCP an authorization letter within two business days thereafter. When you get the letter, you can call a plan specialist to make the appointment. If you do not get an authorization letter, you will be responsible for paying for the services.\n\nThe authorization letter will state the services the plan has approved for coverage. Make sure that you have this authorization letter before any services requiring authorization are furnished to you. If the specialist feels you need services beyond those authorized, the specialist will ask for authorization directly from the plan. If we approve the request for additional services, we will send both you and your PCP an authorization letter.\n\nIf we do not authorize a service, we will send you and your PCP a denial letter within one business day of the decision. The denial letter will explain our reasons for the decision and your right to file an appeal. (For information on filing an appeal, see Inquiries, appeals and grievances.) Pending the outcome of the appeal process, in certain circumstances, such as for immediate or urgently needed services, the plan will provide for",

They use national, evidence-based criteria that are reviewed annually by a committee of health plan and community-based physicians to determine the medical appropriateness of selected services requested by your physician. These criteria are approved as being consistent with generally accepted standards of medical practice, including prudent layperson standards for emergency room care.\n\nFallon also develops in-house criteria, making use of local specialist input and current medical literature, as well as guidelines from Medicare and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nTo obtain information about the status or outcome of a utilization review decision, call Fallon at 1-866-344-4GIC, ext. 69915 (TRS 711).\nThe plan does not provide compensation or other financial incentive or reward to its in-plan providers or staff who conduct utilization management review that is based on the quantity or type of denial decisions rendered.\n\nQuality management\n\nFallon's Quality Services Program systematically measures, monitors, evaluates and improves the performance of the managed care organization with respect to clinical care and service received by its members. Components of the program include careful attention to credentialing and recredentialing of plan providers, evaluation of all member complaints related to quality of care, and a formal peer review program to identify opportunities for improved care (on both an individual-practitioner level and a system-wide level). The plan also conducts focused performance projects related to plan-specific opportunities and formal chronic disease management programs appropriate to the plan's membership. With respect to service quality, the plan monitors and assures appropriate access to its contracted practitioners as well as complaints related to quality of service. A team of physicians, licensed registered nurses, and specialists create and regularly update clinical guidelines that are then shared with our contracted practitioners to promote preferred medical practices and to improve the quality of care. These guidelines are designed to complement rather than replace your doctor's clinical judgment.\n\nAssessing new technologies\n\nFallon maintains a formal mechanism for evaluation of new medical and behavioral health technologies, the new application of existing technologies, and the review of special cases, through our Technology Assessment Committee. The committee includes physician administrators, practicing physicians from the plan's service area, and plan staff who perform extensive literature review regarding the proposed technology, including review of information from governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and published scientific evidence. We make use of external research organizations, which perform reviews of all available literature regarding a given procedure. When necessary, the committee seeks input from specialists or professionals who have expertise in the proposed technology.\n\nThe committee recommends for health plan coverage and develops written technology assessment criteria in accordance with standards developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for those technologies that can offer improved outcomes to our members without substantially increasing the risks of treatment. Criteria are reviewed at least biennially or more often as new treatments, applications and technologies are adopted as generally accepted practice.\n\nFallon has a separate but similar process for evaluation of new drugs and medications, with reviews performed by our Pharmacy \\& Therapeutics Committee.",

Non-plan providers are providers who are not contracted with Fallon and are not in our HMO network:\n\nEmergency Services in an Emergency Department of a Hospital and Stabilization Services: If you received emergency services in an emergency department of a hospital or services to stabilize that emergency medical condition from a non-plan provider, we will pay the greater of (a) the median amount negotiated with innetwork providers for the emergency services furnished, (b) the usual, reasonable and customary charge, or (c) the amount that would be paid by Medicare (less any cost sharing). If the non-plan provider bills you for more than the amount Fallon paid, you are responsible for paying the provider the balance.\n\nNon-emergency Out-of-network Services: Under most circumstances, non-emergency services received from non-plan providers are not covered without prior authorization. If Fallon decides it will pay for these services, Fallon will pay the usual, reasonable and customary charges (less any cost sharing). If the non-plan provider bills you for more than the usual, reasonable and customary charge, you are responsible for paying the nonplan provider the balance. Fallon reserves the right to pay you directly for these charges. If Fallon pays you directly, you will be responsible for submitting payment to the non-plan providers.\n\nClaims from non-plan providers must be submitted to Fallon within one year of the date of service. Claims submitted more than one year after the date of service will not be paid. You may submit the claim yourself, or the provider may submit it directly. All claims should include a description of the services, the diagnosis, the dates of services and the charge for each service. Send bills to:\n\nFallon Health\nClaims Department\nP.O. Box 15121\n\nWorcester, MA 01615-0121\n\nCare in foreign countries\n\nYou may submit claims for urgent or emergency services in a foreign country if the services are not provided free of charge by that country. The claims must be itemized and in (or translated into) English. Payment will be made to you, and you must pay the provider.\n\nRecovering money owed\n\nWe have the right to recover any money you owe to us, a health plan physician, or a health plan facility, or any other person or facility providing services to you on behalf of the plan. We will do so by offsetting the amount you owe us with any reimbursement payments we may owe you. This will satisfy our obligation to pay for services you receive.",

Other plans include personal injury protection insurance, automobile insurance, medical payments coverage, homeowner's insurance, school insurance and other plans that pay medical expenses. To the extent permitted by law, medical payments coverage and benefits available under an auto, homeowners or commercial policy shall be primary to this Plan.\n\nUnder COB, one plan pays full benefits as the primary carrier. The other (the secondary carrier) pays the balance of covered charges. The primary and secondary carriers are determined by the standard rules that are used by all insurance companies.\n\nWe have the right to exchange benefit information with any other group plan, insurer, organization or person to determine benefits payable using COB. We have the right to obtain reimbursement from you or another party for services provided to you.

If we provide or arrange services when another carrier is primary, we have the right to recover any overpayment from the primary carrier or other appropriate party.

If you are eligible for workers' compensation or a similar employer's liability coverage, we may request information from you before processing claims. If we do not receive the necessary documentation from you, we may deny your claim.\n\nMedicare\n\nIf you are entitled to Medicare, Medicare is generally considered to be your primary health insurance, even if you also have health coverage provided by the plan.\nHowever, there are some circumstances in which the plan might be primary over Medicare. Your age, work status and (if you are eligible for Medicare due to disability) the presence of specific disabling medical conditions may affect which coverage is considered to be your primary insurance.\n\nIf you are covered under a group health plan and are eligible for Medicare only because of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), we will be the primary payer for covered services for a period of 30 months starting with the date you become eligible for Medicare coverage. After 30 months, Medicare will become the primary payer and we will become the secondary payer. As the secondary payer, our payments will be reduced by the Medicare allowed amount for the same covered services.

        "text": "Important Notice from the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) About Your Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare\n\n\nPlease read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with the Fallon Select Care plan and your options under Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining a non-GIC plan, you should compare your current coverage particularly which drugs are covered, and at what cost - with that of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage can be found at the end of this notice.\n\nFOR MOST PEOPLE, THE DRUG COVERAGE THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE THROUGH YOUR GIC HEALTH PLAN IS A BETTER VALUE THAN THE NON-GIC MEDICARE PART D DRUG PLANS.\n\nThere are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare's prescription drug coverage:\n1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available to everyone with Medicare in 2006. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium.\n2. The GIC has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by your plan is, on average for all participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare Part D drug plan.\n\nWhen Can You Join A Medicare Part D Drug Plan?\n\nYou can join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each subsequent year from October $15^{\\text {th }}$ to December $7^{\\text {th }}$.\n\nHowever, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan.\n\nWhat Happens To Your Current Coverage If You Decide To Join A Non-GIC Medicare Drug Plan?\n- If you enroll in another Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with or without prescription drug coverage, you will be disenrolled from the GIC-sponsored Select Care plan. If you are disenrolled from the Select Care plan, you will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.\n- If you are the insured and decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan, both you and your covered spouse/dependents will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.\n- If you have limited income and assets, the Social Security Administration offers help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage. Help is available online at www.socialsecurity.gov or by phone at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).",

        "text": "When Will You Pay A Higher Premium (Penalty) To Join A Medicare Drug Plan?\n\nYou should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with a GIC plan and don't join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later.\n\nIf you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least $1 \\%$ of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least $19 \\%$ higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay this higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the following November to join.\n\nFor More Information About This Notice Or Your Current Prescription Drug Coverage....\n\nContact the GIC at (617) 727-2310, extension 1. NOTE: You will receive this notice each year and if this coverage through the Group Insurance Commission changes. You may request a copy of this notice at any time.\n\nFor More Information About Your Options Under Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage...\n\nMore detailed information about Medicare plans that offer prescription drug coverage is in the \"Medicare \\& You\" handbook. You'll get a copy of the handbook in the mail every year from Medicare. You may also be contacted directly by Medicare drug plans.\n\nFor more information about Medicare prescription drug coverage:\n- Visit www.medicare.gov\n- Call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (see the inside back cover of your copy of the \"Medicare \\& You\" handbook for the telephone number) for personalized help.\n- Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227); TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.\n\nIf you have limited income and assets, extra help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage is available. For information about the Extra Help program, visit Social Security online at www.socialsecurity.gov or call 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).\n\nRemember: Keep this Creditable Coverage notice. If you decide to join one of the Medicare drug plans, you may be required to provide a copy of this notice when you join to show whether or not you have maintained creditable coverage and, therefore, whether or not you are required to pay a higher premium (a penalty).",

Any changes that you make become effective on the anniversary date. If you have any questions about your group's enrollment period or anniversary date, please contact the GIC.\n\nYou may enroll in this plan during open enrollment, or within 31 days of the date you are first eligible. Coverage will begin on the first day of the month following 60 days of employment or two calendar months, whichever is less. You may also be eligible to enroll at a later date under the following circumstances:\n- You declined this coverage when first eligible because you or your eligible dependent were covered under another group health plan or another health insurance coverage, but the other coverage has ended. You and your dependent may enroll in this plan within 31 days of your termination of coverage under the other health plan by providing proof that is satisfactory to the GIC.\n- You declined this coverage when first eligible, but have since acquired a dependent through marriage, birth or adoption. You or your dependent may enroll within 31 days of the date of the marriage, birth or adoption (including any probationary period).\nExcept for the above circumstances, employees who choose not to join the plan when first eligible must wait until the next open enrollment period to join.\n\nPremium charge\n\nAs a Fallon subscriber, you are enrolled in a health plan that provides comprehensive benefits and quality care. In order to provide this plan for you, the Group Insurance Commission pays Fallon a monthly premium charge. Your coverage may be terminated if the GIC fails to pay, even if they have charged you all or part of the premium charge (for example, by withholding it from your pay). For the plan year beginning July 1, 2016, and ending June 30, 2017, this amount will be:\n$\\$ 688.25$ per month for individual coverage\n$\\$ 1,651.76$ per month for family coverage\n\nFailure to pay premiums\n\nIf we or our agent do not receive the premium charge by the time it is due, your coverage will be suspended and your contract terminated as described in Cancellation by Fallon. There is a 15-day grace period, following which the contract will be suspended for nonpayment of the premium charge. Group contracts will be cancelled on the 30th day after the due date if the premium charge is not received. You will be covered through midnight on the last day for which payment was received.",

Adopted children are included from the date of placement in the home or, in the case of a foster child, from the date of the filing of the petition to adopt. If your dependent child has a child, that child is included as a family member as long as your dependent child remains enrolled and meets the eligibility regulations under the Massachusetts state mandate. (See Age limits for dependent children.)\n\nAdding dependents\n\nThe subscriber may change to family coverage, or add additional dependents to family coverage at the time of the following qualifying events:\n- The subscriber marries. The subscriber may change to family coverage, or add any additional dependents to family coverage at this time. If a former spouse has been covered prior to the subscriber's marriage, the former spouse may, if the divorce judgment so permits, continue coverage under an individual policy with a separate premium for that policy. Coverage ends if the former spouse remarries or moves out of the Fallon service area.\n- Birth or adoption of a child. The subscriber may change to family coverage, or add any additional dependents to family coverage at this time. Coverage will be retroactive to the newborn's date of birth. (See Changing your coverage.)\n- Loss of other health insurance coverage by a spouse and/or child(ren) who are not currently covered under the subscriber's contract. The subscriber may add only those dependents who have lost their other coverage. If the previous coverage was not through Fallon, we will require notification from the prior insurance company.\n- A spouse and/or child(ren) who formerly lived outside the Select Care service area move into the service area. The subscriber may add only those dependents who have just moved into the service area.\n- The GIC determines that a court order permits the subscriber to provide coverage for a spouse, former spouse or child(ren). (See Divorce for more information about coverage of former spouses in the event of divorce.)\n\nHospital charges for the routine care of a newborn following delivery are covered under either individual or family coverage. Any other services for your newborn children or other new dependents are covered only if the dependent is enrolled under your family coverage. (For information on nongroup enrollment, see Changing to a consumer plan.)\n\nChanging your coverage\n\nA change made at the time of a qualifying event will be effective on the date of the qualifying event if the premium is paid when due. You must notify the GIC of the change within 60 days of the event. If you do not request the change within the 60-day period, you may not make a change until your next anniversary date.",

If you or your children are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you will not be eligible for these premium assistance programs but you may be able to buy individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information visit www.healthcare.gov\n\nIf you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed below, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available.\n\nIf you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your State if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan.\n\nIf you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you are not already enrolled. This is called a \"special enrollment\" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance.

Coverage is subject to GIC approval and the insured parent's continued coverage with the GIC.\n\nDependents 26 and Over (Continued Coverage for Dependents)\n\nA dependent child who reaches age 26 is no longer automatically eligible for coverage under this Plan. A fulltime student at an accredited educational institution at age 26 or over may continue to be covered as a Dependent family member, but must pay $100 \\%$ of the required monthly individual premium.

Applications for continued coverage must be made within 60 days of the death of the insured parent.\n\nDivorce\n\nIn the event of divorce, the subscriber's former spouse may remain under the family coverage. Coverage may continue, with no additional premium due, unless: (1) the divorce decree specifically states that the subscriber is not required (or is no longer required) to maintain health insurance coverage for the former spouse, or (2) either the subscriber or the former spouse remarries.\n\nIf the subscriber remarries and wishes to add his or her new spouse to the family coverage, the former spouse remains eligible for the subscriber's coverage.

        "text": "Overview of Health Insurance Marketplaces\n\nYOU ARE RECEIVING THIS NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY THE NEW NATIONAL HEALTH REFORM LAW (ALSO KNOWN AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ACA)\n\nOn January 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented in Massachusetts and across the nation. The ACA brought many benefits to Massachusetts and its residents, helping us expand coverage to more Massachusetts residents, making it more affordable for small businesses to offer their employees healthcare, and providing additional tools to help families, individuals and businesses find affordable coverage. This notice is meant to help you understand health insurance Marketplaces, which are required by the ACA to make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the state Marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector. While you may or may not qualify for health insurance through the Health Connector, it may still be helpful for you to read and understand the information included here.\n\nOverview: There is an easy way for many individuals and small businesses in Massachusetts to buy health insurance: the Massachusetts Health Connector. This notice provides some basic information about the Health Connector, and how coverage available through the Health Connector relates to any coverage that may be offered by your employer. You can find out more by visiting: MAhealthconnector.org, or for non-\nMassachusetts residents, Healthcare.gov or (1-800-318-2596; TTY: 1-855-889-4325).\nWhat is the Massachusetts Health Connector? The Health Connector is our state's health insurance Marketplace. It is designed to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health insurance that meets their needs and fits their budget. The Health Connector offers \"one-stop shopping\" to easily find and compare private health insurance options from the state's leading health and dental insurance companies. Some individuals and families may also qualify for a new kind of tax credit that lowers their monthly premium right away, as well as cost sharing reductions that can lower out-of-pocket expenses. This new tax credit is enabled by §26B of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code.\n\nOpen enrollment for individuals and families to buy health insurance coverage through the Health Connector occurs every year. You can find out more by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 1-877-MA ENROLL (1-877-623-6765).\n\nCan I qualify for federal and state assistance that reduces my health insurance premiums and out-ofpocket expenses through the Health Connector?\n\nDepending on your income, you may qualify for federal and/or state tax credits and other subsidies that reduce your premiums and lower your out-of-pocket expenses if you shop through the Health Connector. You can find out more about the income criteria for qualifying for these subsidies by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 1-877-MA ENROLL (1-877-623-6765).\n\nDoes access to employer-based health coverage affect my eligibility for subsidized health insurance through the Health Connector?\n\nAn offer of health coverage from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as the employer, could affect your eligibility for these credits and subsidies through the Health Connector. If your income meets the eligibility criteria, you will qualify for credits and subsidies through the Health Connector if:\n- The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not offer coverage to you, or",

Also, please note that the amount that you and your employer contribute to your employersponsored health insurance is often excluded from federal and state income taxes. Health Connector premiums have different tax treatment.\n\nAs part of considering whether the ACA and Marketplaces will affect you as an employee it is important to understand what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts offers you.\n- The Commonwealth offers benefited employees health coverage through the Group Insurance Commission. To be eligible for GIC health insurance, a state employee must work a minimum of $183 / 4$ hours in a 37.5 hour workweek or 20 hours in a 40 hour workweek. The employee must contribute to a participating GIC retirement system, such as the State Board of Retirement, a municipal retirement board, the Teachers Retirement Board, the Optional Retirement Pension System for Higher Education, a Housing, Redevelopment Retirement Plan, or another Massachusetts public sector retirement system (OBRA is not such a public retirement system for this purpose. Visit www.mass.gov/gic or see your GIC Coordinator for more information.\n- Temporary employees, contractors, less-than-half time part time workers, and most seasonal employees are not eligible for GIC health insurance benefits. These employees may shop for health insurance through the Health Connector and may be eligible for advanced premium federal tax credits and/or state subsidies if their gross family income is at or below $400 \\%$ Federal Poverty Level (which is approximately $\\$ 46,000$ for an individual and $\\$ 94,000$ for a family of four).

The contract will be changed whether or not you receive the notice. The notice will indicate the effective date of the change.\n\nWhen we send you a notice, we will mail it to the most recent address on file.

Be sure to give us your old name and address as well as the new information.\n\nFallon contracting arrangements\n\nThe plan contracts with individual physicians, medical groups, hospitals and ancillary providers to provide care to members. Fallon negotiates with providers to agree upon a contracted payment rate. The providers then accept that payment for their services. When you obtain a covered service, the only payment that a provider will collect from you for a covered service is the copayment amount shown in this Member Handbook/Evidence of Coverage, in your Schedule of Benefits or in any applicable amendments.\n\nFallon pays its providers using various payment methods including fee for service, capitation and per diem. Fee for service means payments are based on an agreed upon fee schedule. Capitation means paying a fixed dollar amount per month for each member assigned to the provider. Per diem means paying a fixed dollar amount per day for all services rendered.\n\nWhen your provider no longer has a contract with us\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any one physician, hospital or other plan provider will be available and/or remain under contract with us. We reserve the right at any time to end our contract with your PCP or with any other plan provider who may be treating you. If this occurs, we will generally no longer pay for services provided to you by that provider, except in the circumstances listed below.\n\nIf the plan provider whose contract we are ending is your PCP, we will notify you in writing at least 30 days prior to the date of the end of his or her contract, except where the contract has been ended for reasons involving fraud, patient safety or quality of care. If your PCP ends his or her contract with us, we will notify you of the change either 30 days prior to the date the contract ends, or as soon as we are notified of the termination, whichever is sooner.\n\nIf our contract with your PCP ends, you will be required to select a new PCP. We will also notify you if you are receiving regular care from a specialist, and that specialist will no longer be under contract with us.\n\nWe will continue to pay for services of your provider after our contract with the provider ends, in the following circumstances only:\n- If our contract with your PCP ends, you may continue to receive treatment from that provider for 30 days beyond the end of the contract, except in circumstances of gross misconduct.\n- If you are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy when our contract with a provider from whom you are receiving pregnancy-related treatment ends, you may continue to receive treatment from that provider through your postpartum period.\n- If you are terminally ill and our contract with a provider from whom you are receiving treatment related to that illness ends, you may continue to receive treatment from that provider.",

You also can get provider information and choose a new PCP on our website, at fallonhealth.org/gic.\n\nContinuation of services with a non-plan provider\n\nOnce you become a plan member, we will generally only pay for services that you receive from plan providers. However, there are some circumstances in which we will temporarily pay for services that you receive from a non-plan provider, if you had been receiving care from that provider prior to becoming a member:\n- If your prior PCP is not a participating provider in any health insurance plan that your plan sponsor offers, we will pay for services from that provider for 30 days from your effective date.\n- If you are receiving an ongoing course of treatment from a provider who is not a participating provider in any health insurance plan that your plan sponsor offers, we will pay for services from that provider for 30 days from your effective date.\n- If you are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, and you are receiving services related to your pregnancy from a provider who is not a participating provider in any health insurance plan that your plan sponsor offers, we will pay for services from that provider through your postpartum period.\n- If you are terminally ill, and you are receiving ongoing treatment from a provider who is not a participating provider in any health insurance plan that your plan sponsor offers, we will pay for your services from that provider until your death.\n\nIn all cases, the provider must agree to accept reimbursement for services at our rates, and to adhere to our quality assurance standards and other policies and procedures such as obtaining appropriate referrals and prior authorizations. You will be eligible for benefits as if the provider was under contract with us, and your copayments will be at the Tier 2 base copayment amount.\n\nResponsibility for the acts of providers\n\nThe arrangement between the plan, plan providers and the plan facilities is that of independent contractors. They are not our agents. We are not liable for injuries or damages resulting from acts or omissions by them or by any other institution or person providing services to you. You should not rely on providers or facilities for any assurances or interpretation of plan policies or benefits. We will not interfere with the ordinary relationship between providers and their patients except in circumstances in which a provider does not comply with health plan policies.\n\nIf you are admitted to a hospital or other facility as an inpatient, or if you are an outpatient, you will be subject to all of that facility's rules. This includes rules on admission, discharge and the availability of services.\n\nIf a provider recommends or provides a specific treatment, this does not necessarily make that treatment a covered benefit. Since plan providers are freely able to recommend treatment options without restraint from the health plan, a referral or recommendation in and of itself does not guarantee that a referral or recommended treatment is a covered benefit or that the accepting provider is contracted with the plan, and does not obligate the plan to pay for the service. Services or supplies that are not described as covered in this Member Handbook/Evidence of Coverage, or that did not receive any necessary authorization from the plan, are not covered benefits.",

(For more information about continuation of coverage once you are no longer eligible through your group, or conversion to a consumer plan, see Conversion options.)\n\nCancellation by Fallon\n\nYou do not have to worry that Fallon will cancel your coverage because you are using services or because you will need more services in the future. We will cancel coverage only for the following reasons:\n- You or a family member no longer live in the Fallon Select Care service area. Notify the GIC within 60 days of the date you move.\n- You made some misrepresentation or you conspired with another party to defraud the plan. An example is an incorrect or incomplete statement on your application form that indicated that you were eligible for coverage when you were not. In such a case, cancellation will be as of your effective date or other date we determine appropriate. We will refund the premium charge you have paid if applicable. Any payments made for claims under this contract will be subtracted from the refund. If we have paid more for claims under this contract than you have paid in premium charges, we have the right to collect the excess from you. In any case of misrepresentation, the health plan may deny enrollment to you in the future.\n- Your premium charge is not paid within the grace period appropriate for your health plan. (See How your coverage works for information about grace periods and nonpayment of premium.) The plan will notify you of the effective date of the cancellation, in accordance with Massachusetts insurance regulations.\n- You commit an act of physical or verbal abuse that poses a threat to a plan provider, a plan employee or another plan member. In such an instance, we must determine that the act of abuse was not related to your physical or mental condition.\n- The GIC cancels its group service agreement with Fallon. In the event that your group coverage is canceled because the GIC fails to pay the premium charge to us, you may apply for short-term (60-day) conversion coverage. To apply for this coverage, send us a written request within 60 days of the day you receive our notice of the group's cancellation. The 60-day conversion coverage will be available at the same cost and coverage level as you previously had under your group coverage. At the end of your 60-day conversion coverage, if you would like to remain a Fallon Health member, you can join a consumer plan. (See Changing to a consumer plan for more information.)\n- As allowed by state or federal law or regulation",

You will receive a COBRA notice and application if the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) is informed that your current GIC coverage is ending due either to (1) end of employment, (2) reduction in hours of employment; (3) death of employee/retiree; (4) divorce or legal separation; or (5) loss of dependent child status. This COBRA notice contains important information about your right to temporarily continue your health care coverage in the Group Insurance Commission's (GIC's) health plan through a federal law known as COBRA. If you elect to continue your coverage, COBRA coverage will begin on the first day of the month immediately after your current GIC coverage ends.\nYou must complete the GIC COBRA Election Form and return it to the GIC by no later than 60 days after your group coverage ends by sending it by mail to the Public Information Unit at the GIC at P.O. Box 8747, Boston, MA 02114 or by hand delivery to the GIC, 19 Staniford Street, $4^{\\text {th }}$ floor, Boston, MA 02114. If you do not submit a completed election form by this deadline, you will lose your right to elect COBRA coverage.\n\nWHAT IS COBRA COVERAGE? The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) is a federal law under which certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses and dependent children have the right to temporarily continue their existing group health coverage at group rates when group coverage otherwise would end due to certain life events, called 'Qualifying Events.' If you elect COBRA coverage, you are entitled to the same coverage being provided under the GIC's plan to similarly situated employees or dependents. The GIC administers COBRA coverage.\n\nWHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR COBRA COVERAGE? Each individual entitled to COBRA (known as a \"Qualified Beneficiary\") has an independent right to elect the coverage, regardless of whether or not other eligible family members elect it. Qualified Beneficiaries may elect to continue their group coverage that otherwise would end due to the following life events:\n\nIf you are an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or municipality covered by the GIC's health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage if\n- You lose your group health coverage because your hours of employment are reduced; or\n- Your employment ends for reasons other than gross misconduct.\n\nIf you are the spouse of an employee covered by the GIC's health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage for yourself if you lose GIC health coverage for any of the following reasons (known as \"qualifying events\"):\n- Your spouse dies;\n- Your spouse's employment with the Commonwealth or participating municipality ends for any reason other than gross misconduct or his/her hours of employment are reduced; or\n- You and your spouse legally separate or divorce.",

By law, COBRA coverage must begin on the day immediately after your group health coverage otherwise would end. If your group coverage ends due to employment termination or reduction in employment hours, COBRA coverage may last for up to 18 months. If it ends due to any other qualifying events listed above, you may maintain COBRA coverage for up to 36 months.\n\nIf you have COBRA coverage due to employment termination or reduction in hours, your family members' COBRA coverage may be extended beyond the initial 18-month period up to a total of 36 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if a second qualifying event - the insured's death or divorce occurs during the 18 months of COBRA coverage. You must notify the GIC in writing within 60 days of the second qualifying event and before the 18-month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage. Your COBRA coverage may be extended to a total of 29 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if any qualified beneficiary in your family receiving COBRA coverage is disabled during the first 60 days of your 18-month COBRA coverage. You must provide the GIC with a copy of the Social Security Administration's disability determination within 60 days after you receive it and before your initial 18 month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage.\n\nCOBRA coverage will end before the maximum coverage period ends if any of the following occurs:\n- The COBRA cost is not paid in full when due (see section on paying for COBRA);\n- You or another qualified beneficiary become covered under another group health plan that does not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion for the qualified beneficiary's pre-existing covered condition covered by COBRA benefits;\n- You are no longer disabled as determined by the Social Security Administration (if your COBRA coverage was extended to 29 months due to disability);\n- The Commonwealth of Massachusetts or your municipal employer no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees; or\n- Any reason for which the GIC terminates a non-COBRA enrollee's coverage (such as fraud).\n\nThe GIC will notify you in writing if your COBRA coverage is to be terminated before the maximum coverage period ends. The GIC reserves the right to terminate your COBRA coverage retroactively if you are subsequently found to have been ineligible for coverage.\n\nHOW AND WHEN DO I ELECT COBRA COVERAGE? Qualified beneficiaries must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of the date that their group coverage otherwise would end or within 60 days of receiving a COBRA notice, whichever is later. A qualified beneficiary may change a prior rejection of COBRA election any time until that date. If you do not elect COBRA coverage within the 60-day election period, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage.",

        "text": "In considering whether to elect COBRA coverage you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law, including the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a spouse's plan) within 30 days after your GIC coverage ends due to a qualifying event. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of COBRA coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum time available to you.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES COBRA COVERAGE COST? Under COBRA, you must pay $102 \\%$ of the applicable cost of your COBRA coverage. If your COBRA coverage is extended to 29 months due to disability, your cost will increase to $150 \\%$ of the applicable full cost rate for the additional 11 months of coverage. COBRA costs will change periodically; current COBRA rates are included with this notice.\n\nHOW AND WHEN DO I PAY FOR COBRA COVERAGE? If you elect COBRA coverage, you must make your first payment for COBRA coverage within 45 days after the date you elect it. If you do not make your first payment for COBRA coverage within the 45-day period, you will lose all COBRA coverage rights under the plan.\n\nYour first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time your coverage would have ended up to the time you make the first payment. Services cannot be covered until the GIC receives and processes this first payment, and you are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is enough to cover this entire period. After you make your first payment, you will be required to pay for COBRA coverage for each subsequent month of coverage. These periodic payments are due usually around the $15^{\\text {th }}$ of each month. The GIC will send monthly bills, specifying the due date for payment and the address to which payment is to be sent for COBRA coverage, but you are responsible for paying for the coverage even if you do not receive a monthly statement. Payments should be sent to the GIC's address on the bill.\n\nAfter the first payment, you will have a 30-day grace period beyond the due date on each monthly bill in which to make your monthly payment. Your COBRA coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment. If you fail to make a periodic payment before the end of the grace period for that payment, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage.\n\nCAN I ELECT OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE BESIDES COBRA? Yes. You have the right to enroll, within 31 days after coverage ends, in an individual health insurance 'conversion' policy with your current health plan without providing proof of insurability. Alternately, if you are a Massachusetts resident, you may purchase health insurance through the Commonwealth's Health Connector Authority, or for employees in other states, through a Health Insurance Marketplace where available. The GIC has no involvement in conversion programs, and only very limited involvement in Health Connector programs. You pay the premium to the plan sponsor for the coverage. The benefits provided under such a policy might not be identical to those provided through COBRA. You may exercise this right in lieu of electing COBRA coverage, or you may exercise this right after you have received the maximum COBRA coverage available to you.",

Your coverage will be subject to suspension or cancellation if you fail to pay your premium on time. (See How your coverage works.) If you take a leave and group coverage is cancelled for any reason during your leave, you may resume coverage when you return to work without waiting for an open enrollment period.\n\nChanging to a consumer plan\n\nIf your eligibility for health insurance coverage through the GIC ends, you may be eligible to join a consumer plan.

When you have an emergency medical condition, you should go to the nearest emergency room for care or call your local emergency communications system (e.g., police or fire department, or 911).\n\nAn emergency medical condition is a condition, whether physical or mental, manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, with an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of prompt medical attention to result in:\n1. serious jeopardy to the health of the member or another person (or unborn child),\n2. serious impairment to bodily functions, or\n3. serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nExamples of covered emergencies include, but are not limited to, stroke, unconsciousness, heart attack symptoms or severe bleeding.\n\nEmergency services do not require referral or prior authorization, but you must notify the plan of any emergency services that you receive. Your PCP should be notified so that arrangements can be made for any follow-up or continuing care that is medically necessary for you. You should be aware that follow-up care in an emergency room often will not meet a prudent layperson definition and that most emergency room follow-up care can be provided in a setting other than an emergency room.\n\nEmergency services will be covered from all providers at the cost level of the lowest cost-sharing tier regardless of the tier in which the health benefit plan has classified the provider providing such emergency services within the Tiered Provider Network including for inpatient deductibles if the insured seeking or receiving emergency services is subsequently admitted.\n\nUrgent care\n\nSometimes you may need care right away for minor emergencies such as cuts that require stitches, a sprained ankle or abdominal pain. These situations may not pose as much of a threat as the emergency situations discussed above, but they still require fast treatment to prevent serious deterioration of your health.\n\nIf you are within the Select Care service area, call your PCP's office for information on how and where to seek treatment. If your doctor is not available, an on-call doctor will make arrangements for your care. Telephones are answered 24 hours a day seven days a week. Explain the medical situation to the doctor and state where you are calling from, so that the doctor can refer you to the most appropriate facility. You may also call the Reliant Medical Group Urgent Care Department directly for an appointment for urgent care services if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP.\n\nIf you are outside the Select Care service area, go to the nearest medical facility for care. If you need followup care, you should contact your PCP for assistance.\n\nCovered services\n1. Emergency room visits\n2. Emergency room visits when you are admitted to an observation room\n3.

(Please note that there are some medications that cannot be mailed and are not available through the mail-order program.) See your Select Care Provider Network directory for a list of plan pharmacies.\n\nThe Fallon Health formulary\n\nThe Fallon formulary is a list of medications that shows the applicable cost-sharing tier and prior authorization requirements for each medication. We have selected the tiers and determined the criteria for prior authorization based on efficacy and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe Fallon prescription drug formulary has a multi-tiered cost-sharing structure. We have selected the tiers based on efficacy and cost-effectiveness. There is a different cost-sharing for each tier.\n\nCoverage of certain drugs is based on medical necessity. For these drugs, you will need prior authorization from the plan. They are noted on the formulary as \"PA.\" Your doctor should request authorization from Fallon, and give us the clinical information that we need to make our decision, before he or she writes the prescription. We will review the authorization request according to our criteria for medical necessity.\n\nThe prescription drug formulary is available at our website at fallonhealth.org/gic. If you do not have access to our website or if you have any questions about the formulary please call Customer Service.\n\nThe Fallon formulary may include drugs used for the formulary treatment of cancer or HIV/AIDS, in accordance with state law.\n\nDispensing limitations\n\nPrescription drugs are generally dispensed for up to a 30 -day supply. The corresponding cost-sharing, as noted in your Schedule of Benefits, will be charged for up to a 30 -day supply. In some instances, the plan has established dispensing limitations, which may include a quantity limit on certain medications. For maintenance medication you may obtain up to a 90-day supply. We follow FDA, state and federal dispensing guidelines. You generally cannot obtain a refill until most or all of the previous supply has been used.\n\nPlease note: Your doctor may prescribe medication in a dose that is not available through the purchase of a single prescription. In these cases, you may need to fill more than one prescription-and pay the corresponding cost-sharing, as noted in your Schedule of Benefits, each-to achieve the desired dose.\n\nGeneric and brand-name drugs\n\nA generic drug is a drug product that meets the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is equivalent to a brand-name product in terms of quality and performance. It may differ in certain other characteristics (e.g., shape, flavor or preservatives). By law, generic drug products must contain identical amounts of the same active drug ingredient as the brand-name product.\n\nA generic preferred program is now in place. This means if you fill a prescription with a brand-name drug when a generic is available, you will be responsible for the drug copayment plus the cost difference between the two drugs.",

You may have your prescription mailed directly to you at home or at any other location if you are traveling within the country. Most medications can be mailed; however, there are some that may not. (Medications cannot be mailed to other countries.)\n\nWhen you fill your prescription through our mail-order program you may order up to a 90-day supply of most medications. The Tier-1 and Tier-2 mail-order copayment amount is equal to the cost of two retail pharmacy copayments (that is, the amount you would pay for a 60-day supply at a retail pharmacy). The Tier-3 mailorder copayment amount is equal to the cost of two-and-one-quarter retail pharmacy copayments.\n\nNew members\n\nIf you are a new member and need to have an existing prescription refilled, we encourage you to see your PCP to review your prescriptions. If you are currently taking a drug for that requires prior authorization by Fallon, your doctor will need to submit a request for prior authorization.
