For those employees who submit their premium payments directly to headquarters, the premium for the additional unit of dependent coverage should be submitted with the premium due for the month of November 1966, and with each premium payment thereafter, if the additional coverage is desired. If the November premium has already been forwarded to headquarters, the additional amount for the new coverage may be sent separately. It should be forwarded, however, so as to be received during the 30 -day grace period (ending 30 November) so that the additional coverage will continue without interruption.\n\n4. Please also advise all WAEPA policyholders whose premiums are paid by payroll deduction and who have coverage for their dependents under this insurance that, if they do not desire this additional unit of coverage, they must advise headquarters in writing prior to 1 December 1966. In such event the amount already deducted for the additional coverage will be refunded.\n\nFOR THE CHIEF, $\\square$ 25X1A2g",
