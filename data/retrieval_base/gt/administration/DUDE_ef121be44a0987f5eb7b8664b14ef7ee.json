        "text": "PROPERTY RIGHTS: Who Owns Your Land?\n\nAs featured on The 700 Club Newswatch, April 3, 1995\n\nThe Facts\n\nFor most people, the term \"wetlands\" brings to mind low-lying areas of marshlands. But as many Americans are discovering, the land they live and work on is now being classified as \"wetlands\"-an alarming trend that many believe is threatening their property rights.\n\nOne such \"wetland\" is located on property owned by Fred Cline in California's Somoma Valley It was going to be his \"dream property\" and home to a vineyard.\n\nBut the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in and determined that a portion of Cline's property was federally protected wetlands. Cline was shocked. \"In the summertime it is completely dry and it's some of the best farm ground around.\"\n\nIn the past four years, Cline says the government has gone to great lengths to take his land without compensating him. \"Why didn't they come to us and say, 'This is very valuable as a wetland for our country, so our country is going to pay you for this'?\" asks Cline.\n\nThe case was eventually turned over to the U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.\n\nAccording to Cline's wife, Nancy, in January 1994 the FBI conducted an investigation that consisted of \"interviewing neighbors, strangers [and] acquaintances, asking questions about how we treat our family, [asking], 'Does Fred have a temper?' Are we intelligent? What [is] our religion?: What [are lour praying habits? ....It was unbelievable to us. We were terrified.\" The criminal case against the Clines was eventually dropped, but not before they had spent $\\$ 100,000$ in legal fees defending their property\n\nMembers of Congress recently heard another property rights horror story from Louisiana developer Anthony Palermo. Palermo wants to build a car dealership on commercial property he owns, but the land was declared a wetland by the feds. During their investigation, the Amm Corps of Engineers asked Palermo to detail the need for another car dealership in the area-including documentation listing the dealerships already there and the number of people served.\n\nThis action prompted Rep. Jimmy Hayes (D-LA) to call the Army Corps a \"federal agency [that's] zoning America.\"\n\nIn March, members of the House of Representatives approved legislation protecting the rights of property owners. Known as HR 925, the legislation requires the federal government to compensate landowners if their property is devalued by 20 percent or more because of government action. The US. Senate is now considering similar legislation. called the Omnibus Private Property Rights Act of 1995.\n\nThe Clinton Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers oppose this legislation. Michael Davis of the Army Corps says such legislation would mean \"we would either quit protecting these resources that do protect people's property values, or we would have to pay off a lot of money that I don't believe we as taxpayers could afford to do.\"\n\nBut the Clines suggest America must place the constitutional rights of its citizens first \"Our Constitution gives us private property rights, but if we don't protect them, we're going to lose them,\" said Fred Cline.\n\nPat Robertson Responds\n\"IThe 'takings' clause] is the part of the Constitution [that holds] back the monster that is rolling from Washington. And this wetlands [situation] has, in my opinion, gotten completely out of hand....Wetlands [are] a good thing—to preserve the wetlands along the various estuaries and the rivers....But we're not talking about this in this case.\"\n\nHighlights From History\n\"No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.\"\n(The \"Takings\" Clause of the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution)\n\nStandards To Live By\n\"You shall not steal.\" Exodus 20:15\n\"For you showed sympathy to the prisoners, and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property...\" Hebrews 10:34\n\nFor Your Information\nFor The Latest On Property Rights And Wetlands, Contact: The Coalition for Property Rights P.O.
