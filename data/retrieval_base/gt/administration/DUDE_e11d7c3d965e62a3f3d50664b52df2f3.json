Reynolds\n\nDear Mr. Warner:\nThis letter follows our recent telephone conversation concerning this matter. As I reported to you by telephone, I have spoken to Ms. Reynolds and confirmed that she and the birth center do not have coverage for this claim. In 2015, Ms. Reynolds was covered by the Lancet Insurance Company. The policy premium to renew that policy in 2016 was excessive, and so she cancelled and switched to the Florida Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association. The premium for tail coverage for the Lancet was also excessive and she could not afford it. Unfortunately, the Lancet was a claims-made policy and therefore does not cover this claim because it came in after the policy expired. The FMMJUA policy is on an occurrence form, meaning that it only covers occurrences which occur during the policy period. I have enclosed an Affidavit of Ms. Reynolds with some supporting documentation.\n\nI am trying to assist Ms. Reynolds without making an appearance. Not only does she not have insurance, but she does not have assets that would cover even a small judgment.\n\nYou indicated during our call that you would speak to your client about dismissing the case. If you need additional information or would like to discuss it further, please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Thank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRobert D. Henry\n\nEnclosures\ncc: Amy Reynolds",

A claim has been made against me and The Ocala Birth Center by Stephanie Cudnik and Kenneth Cudnik on behalf of their child, Sawyer Cudnik. Sawyer Cudnik was delivered at the Ocala Birth Center in late 2015. At the time of his birth, I was insured by Lancet Indemnity Insurance Company with a policy effective date of July 1,2015 , and an expiration date of July 1 , 2016. Said policy was not renewed in 2016 and tail coverage was not purchased. In 2016, coverage was purchased with the Florida Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association, which policy is an occurrence policy.\n\n4. The claim on behalf of Sawyer Cudnik has been reported to Lancet Indemnity. Lancet Indemnity has informed me that because I did not purchase tail coverage, there is no coverage for this claim. I have also contacted the Florida Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association, but have been told that because they issue occurrence policies and this occurrence occurred before Purchased insurance from them in 2016, there is no coverage.",
