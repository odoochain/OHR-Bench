Such quitclaim deed was recorded in King County under Recording No. 7904110767. A copy of such quitclaim deed is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.\n3.5 On May 31, 1983, Jefferson Park was administrative dissolved by the Washington Secretary of State. A copy of the certificate of dissolution is attached hereto as\n\nExhibit 3.\n3.6 The articles of incorporation for Jefferson Park filed with the Secretary of State does not designate any successor entity in the event of dissolution nor does any filing related to its dissolution.\n3.7 No successor entity for Jefferson Park has been found despite a diligent search.\n3.8 The Subject Property contains a Victorian house built in 1900 which has served as Garden Clubs headquarter and is rented out for parties to third parties.\n3.9 The cost of maintenance, taxes and other costs of ownership exceeds the revenues derived therefrom and the organization is desirous to sell the real property.\n3.10 Because of the Deed Restriction, the Subject Property is not able to be sold for its otherwise fair market value to third parties who might use it in a fashion that violates the covenant. Conversely, nonprofit organizations that may be eligible to acquire the Subject Property for use within the scope of the Deed Restriction either cannot pay even a reasonably reduced price while at the same time assuming the costs of ownership. Because of such factors, the Subject Property has been rendered unmarketable in a reasonable fashion with the current deed restriction. Without the ability to sell the Subject Property at or near a fair market value, Garden Clubs will not be able to purchase a less costly new headquarters so as to carry on its community interest purpose and the Subject Property will gradually fall into disrepair and",

Such \"Unknown Successors\" and \"Unknown Parties\" are named for notice purposes.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: DECLARATORY RELIEF/OUIET TITLE: Unreasonable restraint on alienation\n\nThe Deed Restriction on the Subject Property contained in the Deed is an unreasonable restriction on alienation as enforcement of the Deed Restriction will cause an injurious effect to both the owner, Garden Clubs, and the actual Subject Property as it will be unable to be adequately maintained. Further, the entity that imposed the restriction, Jefferson Park, has ceased to exist and thus no longer has a legitimate interest in the Deed Restrictions enforcement. Such factors combined with the common law disfavor of restraints upon alienation render the Deed Restriction invalid and unenforceable.\n\nV. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: DECLARATORY RELIEF/OUIET TITLE: Burden on real property without benefitted property or person\n\nThe Deed Restriction on the Subject Property contained in the Deed is an improper restrictive covenant as it does not \"touch and concern\" nor benefit any other real property, does not specify a benefitted party or entity so as to be some sort of restriction in gross, and the party establishing the restrictive covenant has dissolved and no party has standing any more to even enforce the covenant. As such it is an unenforceable, improper cloud on title",
