C.\n\n\n2 November 1948\n\nMEMORANDOM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:\nSUBJECT: Clandestine Air Transport\n1. Reference is made to letters sent to the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Justice, Commerce, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Central Intelligence Agency by the Secretary of Defense on 14 July 1948, which stated in substance that the Secretary of Conmerce had sugested that the Military Establishment call a meeting of representatives of the foregoing Departments and agencies with view to studying the problems and details concerning the clandes tine use of aircraft. The letters further stated that the undersigned would act as chairnan of such meetings.\n2. The undersigned called meeting of the foregoing representatives, at which the problem as a whole was studied and various facets of the problem taken up in detail through an ad hoc committee. A report of these deliberations, covering background of the subject, a summary of actions taken, contemplated actions, proposed remedial legislation, general comments and recomendations, is enclosed.\n3. Attention is invited to the fact that the committee recomends that this report be submitted to the National Security Council for such action as it deems appropriate. I concur in this recomendation, but feel compelled to point out that the deliberations of the Committee on export control disclosed the extreme vulnerability of the United States to the entry by air of undesirable personnel as well as extrenely dangerous material and equipment. In my opinion, this aspect of the problem of illicit air transport also deserves careful consideration by the Security Council.\n/s/ LeR. Lutes\nLeR.
