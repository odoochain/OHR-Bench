Mosley\nAssembly District 57\n55 Hanson Place\nBrooklyn, NY 11217\n\nRe: 1024 Fulton Street, Brooklyn, NY 11238\n\nA partnership between TCH Holding, LLC (TCH) and Fort Green Senior Council (FGS) seeks to redevelop a vacant existing building with an adaptive reuse approach to incorporate existing portions of the property with new construction of community facility space and ground floor retail with the potential inclusion of senior housing in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nWe have prepared two potential options:\n1. Incorporating a deed restriction modification to enable the development of a 10-story building of 61 units of residential senior housing with a commercial and community facility component\n\nOPTION 1\n\nDEVELOPMENT OUTLINE SENIOR HOUSING\n\nThis proposed option is a building featuring mixed-use affordable housing for senior citizens with a total size of 77,252 square feet. The project will include of a partial removal of the existing structure with the option to retain the 12,861 square foot cellar. The first two floors will consist of 12,484 square feet composed of 6,186 square feet of commercial square feet and 6,298 square feet of community facility square feet accessible from street level. The existing historic façade will be preserved. The residential floor area will consist of 51,907 square foot over 10 stories. This residential component will yield sixty apartments with an average size of 550 square feet, as well as one 800 square foot two-bedroom unit for a superintendent. Amenities for residential tenants will include a multipurpose residential lounge, laundry facility, tenant storage, senior services office, property management office, and exercise room. Current plans include eight parking spaces to be provided at the cellar level. To achieve open space, the building will have an open roof deck behind the existing classically designed façade on the third level,",

The maximum available space that can be made available to Fort Greene Council will be 12,484 square feet.\n\nThe project will target a mix of incomes at $50 \\%, 60 \\%$ and $80 \\%$ of area median income to ensure that the project attracts a broad range of senior citizens seeking affordable housing. The project will also set aside $10 \\%$ of units for seniors with special needs.\n\nREQUIRED TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIn our view, certain terms and conditions must be satisfied through a negotiated sale with the State of New York Office of General Services (OGS) in order to effectuate the acquisition of the property:\n- A purchase price of $\\$ 5.0 \\mathrm{MM}$ is required to achieve the stated community mission of providing affordable senior citizen housing\n- Upon agreement of a viable purchase price, TCH and FGS will provide OGS with the required $10 \\%$ down payment on a contract of sale\n- TCH will obtain the balance of financing to complete the acquisition of the property through debt, equity or submission of financing proposals to state housing finance agencies\n- Removal of any existing deed use restrictions and covenants to allow the property's physical and economic maximization is key. To our knowledge, the current deed restriction would prevent the development of the senior housing residential component\n- A new deed should be fee-simple with no restrictions or covenants that would prevent TCH from attracting and soliciting the optimal financing sources, including but not limited to construction/permanent lenders, public subsidies and LIHTC investors to the project.\n\nAffordability Analysis\n\nIn affordable housing development, \"Affordable Units\" typically refer to rents that do not exceed 30\\% of annual household income for families earning no more than 130\\% Area Median Income (AMI) for the metropolitan area of NYC.",

The project will include a partial removal of the existing structure with the option to retain the 12,861 square foot cellar. The first two floors will total 22,470 square feet of commercial retail space with 12,810 square feet on the first and 9,660 square feet on the second. The existing historic façade will be preserved. The third, fourth, and fifth floors will total 28,980 square feet of community facility space used entirely by Fort Greene Council with 9,660 square feet per floor.\n\nWith 28,980 square feet for Fort Greene Council, this option maximizes the space made available for its use.\n\nREQUIRED TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nThe below outlines the items that require resolution in order to most expeditiously effectuate the sale and consequent development of the property in a manner to maximize the benefit for Fort Greene Council:\n- A purchase price of $\\$ 5.0 \\mathrm{MM}$ is required to achieve the mission of maximizing community facility space for Fort Greene Council\n- Upon agreement of a viable purchase price, TCH and FGS will provide OGS with the required 10\\% down payment on a contract of sale\n- TCH will obtain the balance of financing to complete the acquisition of the property through debt, equity or public subsidy\n- Removal of any existing deed use restrictions and covenants to allow the property's physical and economic maximization is key. To our knowledge, the property carries a deed restriction which restricts and limits use of the property to exclusively \"Community Facility Use\". Our proposed usage of the building includes a limited retail commercial component which does not fall within the narrow scope of \"Community Facility Use\". Consequently, we will require modification of this deed restriction to allow for our proposed commercial retail usage\n- A new deed should be fee-simple with no restrictions or covenants that would prevent TCH from attracting and soliciting the optimal financing sources, including but not limited to construction/permanent lenders and public subsidies\n- Development of the property will involve a substantial financial investment on the part of its developers, as well as on the part of the development's proposed anchor tenant, the Fort Greene Council.
