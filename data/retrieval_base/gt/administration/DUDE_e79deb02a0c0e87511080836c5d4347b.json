        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Florida Department of Health conducted a strategic planning process during the summer of 2015 to define the direction and course of the agency for consumers, employees, administrators and legislators for the next three years. This strategic plan will position the Department to operate as a sustainable integrated public health system under the current economic environment and to provide our residents and visitors with high quality public health services. This is a living document that we will evaluate and update regularly to address new challenges posed by the changing environment of public health in Florida.\n\nAfter executive leadership approved the Agency Strategic Plan strategic priorities, goals and objectives, each objective was assigned to a division to implement and monitor. In turn, each division created their own strategic plan that contains their objectives from the Agency Strategic Plan plus other goals, strategies and objectives that emerged as supporting the Department's strategic priorities from their environmental scan and SWOT analysis.\n\nMission - Why do we exist?\n\nTo protect, promote and improve the health of all people in Florida through integrated state, county and community efforts.\n\nVision - What do we want to achieve?\nTo be the Healthiest State in the Nation.\n\nValues - What do we use to achieve our mission and vision?\nI nnovation: We search for creative solutions and manage resources wisely.\nC ollaboration: We use teamwork to achieve common goals \\& solve problems.\nA ccountability: We perform with integrity \\& respect.\n$\\mathbf{R}$ esponsiveness: We achieve our mission by serving our customers \\& engaging our partners.\nE xcellence: We promote quality outcomes through learning \\& continuous performance improvement.\n\nThe Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) is dedicated to the mission, vision and values of the Department. Working in conjunction with 22 boards and six councils, MQA established the strategic priorities set forth in this plan. Over the next three years, MQA will work diligently to accomplish these goals and further contribute to the Department's vision to be the healthiest state in the nation.",

Prior to its first strategic planning meeting, a SWOT analysis (Appendix C) was sent out to MQA executive management and employees. The results were analyzed to determine the similarities and differences. Gaps were identified and addressed during a strategic planning retreat in which MQA management met with the division's Strategic Planning Unit to discuss best practices and solutions. The meeting was the first of many in-depth discussions to develop a strategic plan that promoted MQA's dedication to making Florida the healthiest state to live, work, practice and retire.\n\nAnother SWOT was developed and designed for MQA's executive management and board members to determine if the division's strategies and mission aligned with those of its health care boards. The division director presented the results of the survey at the Annual Board Chairs/Vice Chairs Long-range Planning meeting to executive management and board members. Meeting attendees took part in a facilitated discussion that included information management, communications, programs and services, budget (financial sustainability), and workforce development. Leadership staff conducted an environmental scan of the agency (sources listed in Appendix E). Results were reviewed and the progress of the current Department of Health Strategic Plan was analyzed to formulate additional strategies and objectives for each priority area. The revised proposal was then routed back to executive leadership for comment and approval.\n\nThe following is the strategic plan schedule of meetings:\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n  DATE & MEETING TOPIC & ATTENDEES \\\\\n  $06 / 30 / 15$ & SWOT sent out to MQA management and employees & MQA management and employees \\\\\n  $07 / 15 / 15$ & MQA Employee and management SWOT result analysis & Strategic Planning Services Team \\\\\n  $07 / 23 / 15$ & Strategic Planning Retreat: discussed MQA's strategic focus aligned with DOH's strategic plan & Executive Management Team \\\\\n  $07 / 24 / 15$ & Strategic plan draft development for five years & Executive Management Team, Strategic Planning Services Team \\\\\n  $07 / 24 / 15$ & Strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis.

This statewide performance management system is the cornerstone of the Department's organizational culture of accountability and performance excellence.\n\nThe Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) leadership team will be responsible for monitoring and reporting progress on the goals and objectives of this strategic plan. The team meets quarterly to discuss recommendations about tools and methods that integrate performance management into sustainable business practices. Annually, MQA's strategic plan progress report will be developed and presented to executive leadership, assessing progress toward reaching goals and objectives, and achievements for the year. The plan will be reviewed and revised by January each year, based on an assessment of availability of resources, data and progress.\n\nIn turn, the objectives that come from the Agency Strategic Plan that have been assigned to this division for implementation and quarterly reporting to Florida Health Performs will be reviewed by the Agency's SPIL Team on a quarterly basis for progress toward goals, and an annual progress report will also be developed. The SPIL Team will revise the Agency Strategic Plan annually, based on their assessment of resources, data and progress.\n\n\nLeadership, Workforce and Infrastructure",
