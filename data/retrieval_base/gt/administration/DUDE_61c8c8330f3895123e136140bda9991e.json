Reardon claimed that Underwood, Terry Thompson (TR Strategies) and John Rowley were close friends that advised him on current events within Snohomish County and the Puget Sound Region.

When Colby Underwood was interviewed he stated he held no meetings in the county executive's office and would only go to the county executive's office to get Reardon and take him off campus to discuss campaign strategies and issues. Underwood said he did not have any official business with Snohomish County. (Exhibit 6 - Interview of Underwood) Haakenson, Parry and Peinecke saw Underwood in Reardon's office on occasion, however did not know what was being discussed, since they was not invited to join the conversation. Peinecke added that most of the time Reardon and Underwood would go off campus.

On July 30, 2015, Tamara Dutton was interviewed and confirmed she had an affair with Reardon for approximately six years.

One of the activities Hulten was involved with was \"Clowns of Midnight\". This group was used to bash people and Reardon's opponent, Mike Hope.\n\nDutton stated that Reardon played \"Dirty Politics\" and was a member of a Secret Club. She believed members of the Secret Club consisted of Senator Steve Hobbs, Jon Rudicil, John Pennington, Terry Thompson and Bryan (LNU).\nII. On December 9, 2011, Amy P. Ockerlander was interviewed by the Washington State Patrol, as part of their on-going investigation. During the interview Ms. Ockerlander stated that she had worked for the Snohomish County Executive from July 2007 through January 2011. When Ockerlander was asked what prompted her to be moved to the Surface Water Management Division she stated the following:\n\"Uh, I was brought in the Monday after Christmas last year to the Deputy Executive's office and told I no longer had a position in the executive office, that l'd been replaced and that there was a uh, identified means in the Surface Water Management Division and I had an opportunity to take that role if I so chose.

Reardon said meetings he had with Underwood in the County Executive's Office were to discuss county business with Reardon and County staff. Underwood was not a county employee or with the county staff, he was on contract with Snohomish County as an advisor to the County Executive.\n\nReardon stated Ockerlander was not terminated just transferred to a position with the Surface Water Management Division as a project manager/developer.

Peinecke knew Colby Underwood and when told Reardon and Underwood's calendars had dates and times that coincided with each other, Peinecke did not seem surprised. When told Reardon's calendars had the time blocked off as \"In-Office Staff Meetings\", she appeared surprised. Peinecke would occasionally see Underwood meet with Reardon in his office, however most of the time they would go off campus, especially if it was to discuss campaign business. Peinecke did not know what Reardon and Underwood discussed in Reardon's office.\n\nPeinecke was not privy to why Ockerlander was suddenly moved from the executive's office to another role in a different department. Peinecke knew Kevin Hulten and stated the process used to hire Hulten consisted of couple of interviews. Peinecke acknowledged that Reardon knew Hulten when he was a Legislative aide to Senator Steve Hobbs.\n\nHulten was very contentious and believed he reported directly to Reardon, although he should have been reporting to Haakenson, Deputy Executive Officer.\n\nPeinecke did not know Hulten was using county equipment for campaigning for Reardon. If she knew she would have turned him in to the authorities. Peinecke described Hulten has a mysterious worker who struggled to deliver on the functionality of the office. Hulten's position was supposed to give prompt and efficient responses to the constituency. However, others had to pick up the slack for Hulten since he was rarely in the office. Peinecke did not get along with Hulten very well, since Hulten believed he was above working the menial tasks of the position he was assigned.\nVI. On November 3, 2015, Brian Parry was interviewed and stated he worked for Reardon from February 2005 through 2012.

Haakenson worked for Reardon from July 2010 through 2012.\n\nHaakenson knew Colby Underwood and that he was a political consultant, who specialized in fund raising. When shown Reardon and Underwood's calendars, Haakenson said he saw Underwood in Reardon's office, however did not know what they were discussing.\n\nWhen asked why Ockerlander was terminated, Haakenson explained typically when someone was terminated they did something that desired termination or the executive believed they needed a change in the office. He believed the executive wanted to make a change in the position Ockerlander was filling. Haakenson believed Reardon was looking for someone more inclined to work with the legislature and work on policy issues. Haakenson did not know if Reardon had someone in mind to replace Ockerlander before she was terminated.\n\nWithin a couple of weeks of Ockerlander's termination, Reardon introduced Hulten to Haakenson and had Haakenson introduce Hulten during the cabinet meeting that morning. Haakenson did not believe there was an interview process prior to hiring Hulten. Hulten was hired to work as a Legislative Liaison and conduct lobbying activities, along with other tasks assigned, such as answering constituents' concerns/complaints.\n\nOn occasion Hulten would do his assigned tasks, Haakenson said. Even though he did not hire Hulten, he wrote Hulten's performance evaluations. Hulten had problems with attitude and did not fit in with the rest of the workers in the executive's office. Haakenson would never have hired Hulten, since he was normally the hiring authority for the executive's staff, however he did not have a choice in this case. There were only two occasions where Haakenson was left out of the loop when individuals were being hired, those occasions dealt with the hiring of Hulten and Rudicil, who replaced Nancy Peinecke as Reardon's Executive Assistant.\n\nIV \\\\ SCOPE\n4.1 Staff reviewed the following:",
