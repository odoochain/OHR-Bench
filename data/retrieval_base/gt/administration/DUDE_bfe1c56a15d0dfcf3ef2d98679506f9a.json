Eligibility for Tax Credits\n\nBackground\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, individuals purchasing private coverage through Maryland Health Connection with income less than $400 \\%$ of the federal poverty level will be eligible to pay less than the approved rate for coverage.\n\nThese Marylanders will qualify for Advanced Premium Tax Credits, which cover the cost between what an individual is required to pay and the monthly premium. For example, an individual with income at $150 \\%$ of the federal poverty level will be required to pay only $\\$ 57$ toward the monthly premium for the second lowest cost Silver plan available on Maryland Health Connection.\n\nThere will also be opportunities for low-income Marylanders to reduce deductibles, costsharing, and out-of-pocket caps.",
