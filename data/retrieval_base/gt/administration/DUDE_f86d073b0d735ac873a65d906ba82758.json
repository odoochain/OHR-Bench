Since large corporations employ a vast quantum of societal resources, ITC believes that the governance process should ensure that these resources are utilised in a manner that meets stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. This belief is reflected in the Company's deep commitment to contribute to the \"triple bottom line\", namely the development, nurture and regeneration of the nation's economic, social and environmental capital.\n\nITC's Corporate Governance structure, systems and processes are based on two core principles:\n(i) Management must have the executive freedom to drive the enterprise forward without undue restraints, and\n(ii) This freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of effective accountability.\n\nITC believes that any meaningful policy on Corporate Governance must empower the executive management of the Company. At the same time, Governance must create a mechanism of checks and balances to ensure that the decision-making powers vested in the executive management are used with care and responsibility to meet stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations.\n\nFrom this definition and core principles of Corporate Governance emerge the cornerstones of ITC's governance philosophy, namely trusteeship, transparency, empowerment and accountability, control and ethical corporate citizenship. ITC believes that the practice of each of these creates the right corporate culture that fulfils the true purpose of Corporate Governance.\n\nTrusteeship recognises that large corporations, which represent a coalition of interests, namely\nthose of the shareholders, other providers of capital, business associates and employees, have both an economic and a social purpose, thereby casting the responsibility on the Board of Directors to protect and enhance shareholder value, as well as fulfil obligations to other stakeholders. Inherent in the concept of trusteeship is the responsibility to ensure equity, namely, that the rights of all shareholders, large or small, are protected.\n\nTransparency means explaining the Company's policies and actions to those to whom it has responsibilities. Externally, this means maximum appropriate disclosures without jeopardising the Company's strategic interests and internally, this means openness in the Company's relationship with its employees and in the conduct of its business. ITC believes transparency enhances accountability.\n\nEmpowerment is a process of unleashing creativity and innovation throughout the organisation by truly vesting decision-making powers at the most appropriate levels and as close to the scene of action as feasible, thereby helping actualise the potential of its employees. Empowerment is an essential concomitant of ITC's first core principle of governance that management must have the freedom to drive the enterprise forward. ITC believes that empowerment combined with accountability provides an impetus to performance and improves effectiveness, thereby enhancing shareholder value.\n\nControl ensures that freedom of management is exercised within a framework of checks and balances and is designed to prevent misuse of power, facilitate timely management of change and ensure effective management of risks. ITC believes that control is a necessary concomitant of its second core principle of governance that the freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of appropriate checks and balances.\n\nEthical Corporate Citizenship means setting exemplary standards of ethical behaviour, both internally within the organisation, as well as in external relationships. ITC believes that unethical behaviour corrupts organisational culture and undermines stakeholder value. Governance processes in ITC continuously reinforce and help realise the Company's belief in ethical corporate citizenship.",

        "text": "THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\nThe practice of Corporate Governance in ITC is at three interlinked levels:\ni. Strategic supervision - by the Board of Directors\nii. Strategic management - by the Corporate Management Committee\niii. Executive management - by the Divisional / Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Chief Executive assisted by the respective Divisional / SBU Management Committee.\nThe three-tier governance structure ensures that:\n(a) Strategic supervision (on behalf of the shareholders), being free from involvement in the task of strategic management of the Company, can be conducted by the Board with objectivity, thereby sharpening accountability of management;\n(b) Strategic management of the Company, uncluttered by the day-to-day tasks of executive management, remains focused and energised; and\n(c) Executive management of a Division or Business, free from collective strategic responsibilities for ITC as a whole, focuses on enhancing the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the business.\nThe core roles of the key entities flow from this structure. The core roles, in turn, determine the core responsibilities of each entity. In order to discharge such responsibilities, each entity is empowered formally with requisite powers.\nThe structure, processes and practices of governance enable focus on the Corporate purpose while simultaneously facilitating effective management of the wider portfolio of businesses.\nThe Governance Document that sets out the structure, policies and practices of governance of the various entities within the organisation is available on the Company's corporate website www.itcportal.com for general information.\n\nROLES OF VARIOUS ENTITIES\n\nBoard of Directors (Board): The primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship to protect and enhance shareholder value through strategic supervision of ITC, its wholly owned subsidiaries and their wholly owned subsidiaries. As trustees, the Board ensures that the Company has clear goals relating to shareholder value and its growth.\n\nThe Board sets strategic goals and seeks accountability for their fulfilment. The Board also provides direction and exercises appropriate control to ensure that the Company is managed in a manner that fulfils stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. The Board, as part and parcel of its functioning, also periodically reviews its role.\nCorporate Management Committee (CMC): The primary role of the CMC is strategic management of the Company's businesses within Board approved direction / framework. The CMC operates under the strategic supervision and control of the Board.\nChairman: The Chairman of ITC is the Chief Executive of the Company. He is the Chairman of the Board and the CMC. His primary role is to provide leadership to the Board and the CMC for realising Company goals in accordance with the charter approved by the Board. He is responsible, inter alia, for the working of the Board and the CMC, for ensuring that all relevant issues are on the agenda and for ensuring that all Directors and CMC members are enabled and encouraged to play a full part in the activities of the Board and the CMC. He keeps the Board informed on all matters of importance. He is also responsible for the balance of membership of the Board, subject to Board and Shareholder approvals. He presides over General Meetings of Shareholders.\nDivisional Management Committee (DMC) / SBU Management Committee (SBU MC): The primary role of the DMC / SBU MC is executive management of the Divisional / SBU business to realise tactical and strategic objectives in accordance with Board approved plan.\nExecutive Director: The Executive Directors, as members of the CMC, contribute to the strategic management of the Company's businesses within Board approved direction / framework. As Directors accountable to the Board for a business / corporate function, they assume overall responsibility for its strategic management, including its governance processes and top management effectiveness. As Directors accountable to the Board for a wholly owned subsidiary or its wholly owned subsidiary, they act as the custodians of ITC's interests and are responsible for their governance in accordance with the charter approved by the Board.\nNon-Executive Director: Non-Executive Directors, including Independent Directors, play a critical role in imparting balance to the Board processes by bringing an independent judgement on issues",

        "text": "REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS \\& Management Discussion and Analysis\n\nFor the Financial Year Ended 31st March, 2007\n\nYour Directors submit their Report for the financial year ended 31st March, 2007.\n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\n\nAdvance estimates of the Central Statistical Organisation indicate a real GDP growth of 9.2\\% for 2006/07. The average growth rate over the past four years stands at 8.6\\%, making it the fastest pace of growth in India's history. While all three sectors of the economy recorded positive growth during 2006/07, the key driver was the industrial sector, which grew by an estimated 10\\%. Industrial growth was led by the manufacturing sector, which recorded an impressive increase of $11.3 \\%$ bolstered by capital goods production, which grew by $17.7 \\%$ over the previous year. The strong showing of the capital goods sector reflects the continuing momentum of the investment cycle. The Services sector posted a robust growth of $11.2 \\%$ in line with the strong performance trend of the previous years. Agriculture sector recorded a relatively low growth of $2.7 \\%$.\n\nThe value of India's merchandise exports grew by $20.8 \\%$ to touch USD 124.6 billion during the year. Exports clocked an impressive $21.6 \\%$ growth for the first 8 months of the year but lost momentum thereafter due to a slowdown in the US economy and the appreciation of the Indian Rupee. India's trade deficit widened further to touch USD 56.7 billion, an increase of $40.6 \\%$ over 2005/06, mainly on account of a sharp increase in the value of oil imports. However, net invisibles surplus on account of buoyant service exports helped ameliorate the impact on the current account. The overall position on external balances remains strong with foreign exchange reserves increasing by USD 47 billion during the year. The strong overall economic performance during the year was however accompanied by rising inflation. Several policy measures were announced in response, aimed at curtailing liquidity and improving supply side conditions. These included the increase in the repo rate and cash reserve ratio, duty free imports of wheat and pulses, and reduction in import duties on non-ferrous metals, cement, capital goods etc.\n\nThe strong investment momentum and high levels of business confidence justify the double-digit GDP growth aspirations set in the 11 th Plan.\n\nHigh levels of economic growth are essential to realise the oft quoted demographic dividend through the creation of employment opportunities for the 9 to 10 million people expected to enter the job market annually, the majority of whom would be from rural India. However, economic growth does not necessarily translate to sustainable development. The manner of industrial growth so far has taken an immeasurable toll of finite natural resources, and yet left vast numbers of people in poverty. On the one hand, depletion of biodiversity resources - soil, water, air - has considerably increased the fragility of ecological balance. On the other hand, the declining rate of growth of agriculture has led to the present situation where nearly 60\\% of India's population shares less than $20 \\%$ of its output. These dichotomies can be eliminated only if the challenges of inclusive growth, national competitiveness and environmental sustainability are addressed in an integrated fashion.\n\nOver 75\\% of those below the poverty line reside in rural India. A comprehensive growth strategy for rural India, including the agricultural sector, is necessary to address the serious issues relating to sustainability and to enlarge effective domestic demand. Empowerment of the rural population has therefore assumed centrality in policy focus. Time bound programmes, such as Bharat Nirman, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan etc., and the emphasis on physical outcomes rather than on mere financial outlays, have the potential to contribute significantly to economic capacity creation at the grassroots and to create the right sentiment for enlarged participation of private entrepreneurship in the economic advancement of rural India.\n\nIn this context, your Company's pioneering e-Choupal initiative is a powerful illustration of linking business purpose with a larger societal cause. The e-Choupal leverages the power of the Internet to empower the small and marginal farmer with a host of services related to know-how, best practices, timely and relevant weather information, transparent discovery of prices and much more. This digital infrastructure is also increasingly being used for channelising services related to credit and insurance and can be extended to areas such as health,",

It can also serve as a strong foundation for linking small and marginal farmers to the futures markets to facilitate farmer risk management. The access to e-Choupals, within walking distance from the farm gate, is supplemented through physical infrastructure - the ITC Choupal Saagar - which functions as a hub for a cluster of villages within tractorable distance. These made-to-design hubs also serve as warehouses, and as rural hypermarkets for a variety of goods. In effect, the e-Choupal infrastructure is potentially an efficient delivery channel for rural development and an instrument for converting village populations into vibrant economic organisations.\n\nGrowth agendas can become sustainable only if they include in their wake strategies to enhance ecological and social capital, thereby translating to development. In line with this philosophy, your Company is engaged in enlarging its contribution across all the three dimensions - economic, ecological and social - through investments in all its businesses and across the value chains, where feasible. Highlights of your Company's progress in pursuit of the 'triple bottom line' objectives are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\nCOMPANY PERFORMANCE\n\nYour Company completed yet another year of strong performance with robust topline growth and high quality earnings. All business segments posted strong growth in revenues and enhanced their market standing, testifying to the robustness of the corporate strategy of creating multiple drivers of growth. This performance is even more satisfying when viewed in the light of the challenging business environment of the cigarette industry, incubation costs of the new FMCG businesses and the rural marketing initiatives and the gestation costs of fresh investments in the paperboards and hotels businesses.\n\nGross Turnover for the year grew by $20.2 \\%$ to Rs. 19505 crores. Net Turnover at Rs. 12369 crores grew by $26.3 \\%$ driven by the non-cigarette FMCG businesses, higher agri-business revenues and the continuing strong performance by the Hotels business. The non-cigarette portfolio grew by $37.6 \\%$ during the year and now accounts for $52.3 \\%$ of the\n\nCompany's Net Turnover. Pre-tax profit increased by $20.1 \\%$ to Rs. 3927 crores, while Post-tax profit at Rs. 2700 crores registered a growth of $20.8 \\%$. Earnings Per Share for the year stands at Rs. 7.19. Cash flows from Operations stood at Rs. 3402 crores during the year.\n\nIn order to strike a balance between the need to sustain strategic investments for a secure future and the annual expectation of shareholders for growing income, your Directors are pleased to recommend a dividend of Rs. 3.10 per share (previous year Rs. 2.65 per share) for the year ended 31st March, 2007. The cash outflow in this regard will be Rs. 1364.50 crores (previous year Rs. 1134.70 crores) including Dividend Tax of Rs. 198.21 crores (previous year Rs. 139.56 crores). Your Board further recommends a transfer to General Reserve of Rs. 1250 crores (previous year Rs. 1150 crores). Consequently, your Board recommends leaving an unappropriated balance in the Profit and Loss Account of Rs. 647.53 crores (previous year Rs. 562.06 crores).\n\nPROFITS, DIVIDENDS AND RETENTION\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n  & & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{(Rs. in crores)} \\\\\n  & & 2007 & 2006 \\\\\n  a) & Profit Before Taxation and Exceptional Items & 3926.70 & 3269.19 \\\\\n  b) & Income Tax & 1226.73 & 988.82 \\\\\n  c) & Profit After Taxation Before Exceptional Items & 2699.97 & 2280.37 \\\\\n  d) & Exceptional Items (net of tax) & - & (45.02) \\\\\n  e) & Profit After Tax & 2699.97 & 2235.35 \\\\\n  f) & Add: Profit brought forward from previous year & 562.06 & 611.41 \\\\\n  g) & Surplus available for Appropriation & 3262.03 & 2846.76 \\\\\n  h) & Transfer to General Reserve & 1250.00 & 1150.00 \\\\\n  i) & Proposed dividend for the financial year at the rate of Rs. 3.10 per Ordinary Share of Re. 1/- each (previous year : Rs. 2.65 per Share)\n & 1166.29 & 995.12 \\\\\n  & Income Tax on proposed dividend (2006-including Rs. 0.02 crore for earlier years) & 198.21 & 139.58 \\\\\n  j) & Retained profit carried forward to the following year & 647.53 & 562.06 \\\\\n  & & 3262.03 & 2846.76 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",

        "text": "REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS\n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS\n\nYour Company continues to view foreign exchange earnings as a key priority. All businesses in the ITC portfolio are mandated to engage with overseas markets with a view to testing international competitiveness and seeking growth opportunities. The ITC Group's contribution to foreign exchange earnings over the last ten years amounted to nearly USD 2.8 billion, of which agri exports constituted nearly $65 \\%$. Earnings from agri exports is an indicator of your Company's contribution to the rural economy through effectively linking small farmers with international markets.\n\nDuring the financial year 2006/07, your Company, its subsidiaries and the ITC Welcomgroup hotel chain together earned Rs. 2444 crores in foreign exchange. Direct foreign exchange earned by your Company amounted to Rs. 2283 crores. Your Company's expenditure in foreign currency amounted to Rs. 1219 crores, comprising purchase of raw materials, spares and other expenses at Rs. 737 crores, and import of capital goods at Rs. 482 crores.\n\nDetails of foreign exchange earnings and outgo are provided in Schedule 19 to the Accounts.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nA. FAST MOVING CONSUMER GOODS\n\nFMCG - Cigarettes\n\nYour Company's uncompromising commitment to providing superior value to consumers through world-class products helped in sustaining its leadership position in the cigarette industry. The year also saw significant growth in exports, with sales increasing by nearly $60 \\%$ over the previous year.\n\nIn line with your Company's mantra of continuous and consistent offering of value added world-class products to the Indian consumer, a unique IT-enabled 'Six Sigma' based product development process was implemented during the year. This strategic intervention enabled the launch of several key initiatives across the brand portfolio in terms of pack modernisation, limited edition offerings in different flavours and the introduction of 'Silk Cut' in the King Size and Regular Filter\nformats. The success of these initiatives is evidenced by the significant enhancement of your Company's market standing in the Premium categories and higher market shares in all segments in key competitive markets across the country. Strategies borne out of deep consumer insights nurtured by your Company and supported by substantial investments have resulted in three of your Company's brands featuring, once again, amongst the top 5 FMCG brands in India.\n\nIn keeping with the policy of maintaining global standards across the value chain, your Company continued to induct state-of-the-art and cutting-edge technology in its manufacturing facilities such as high speed cigarette making and packing machines, round corner/beveled edge packers and automatic filter feed systems. Capability augmentation like in-house expanded tobacco manufacture at the Bangalore facility has already started delivering considerable cost reduction and import substitution benefits. Your Company's tobacco research laboratories obtained the ISO/IEC 17025 Certification from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) earning international recognition for your Company's R\\&D capabilities from the scientific and regulatory communities.\n\nThe EHS initiatives of your Company continue to be acknowledged by international and national bodies. All the four production facilities have once again won the 'RoSPA Gold Award' conferred by the Royal Society for Prevention of Accidents as well as the 'Five Star Rating' by the British Safety Council. The Munger, Bangalore and Saharanpur units were awarded the 'Greentech Safety Gold Award', whilst the Bangalore and Saharanpur facilities also won the 'Sword of Honour' from the British Safety Council. The Kolkata, Bangalore and Munger units were conferred the 'Greentech Environment Excellence Award'. In addition, the Bangalore factory was honoured with the 'Platinum Standard for Outstanding Achievement in Safety Management' by the Greentech Foundation, 'Safety Innovation Award 2006' by the Institution of Engineers and the 'Unnatha Suraksha Puraskara' by the National Safety Council (Karnataka Chapter).

Cigarettes continue to be discriminated against cheaper and revenue inefficient tobacco products like bidis and chewing tobaccos. Excise duty rates on cigarettes were increased for the second successive year. However, while duty rates on cigarettes went up in excess of $6 \\%$ in the Union Budget 2007, the same were left unchanged in respect of most of the other tobacco products. Moreover, with effect from 1st April, 2007, cigarettes have been brought under the ambit of Value Added Tax (VAT) by the States at a rate of $12.5 \\%$ on invoice price, without a reduction/set off in excise duties collected in lieu of State level sales tax. Such a move is against the opinion of Expert Committees on taxation which have, for more than a decade, repeatedly and consistently recommended the exclusion of cigarettes from ad-valorem duties in favour of a single-point specific excise duty structure.\n\nSince taxes already constitute around $130 \\%$ of the net realisation value of cigarettes, the combined impact of the $6 \\%$ increase in excise duty and the imposition of $12.5 \\%$ ad-valorem VAT is equivalent to a $33 \\%$ increase in excise tax incidence on cigarettes - the highest ever increase that the industry has faced. Bidis, on the other hand, have been exempted from VAT by most States. An ad-valorem levy such as VAT on a highly taxed product like cigarettes can have grievous consequences on the livelihood of more than a million farmers and farm-workers. It is pertinent to note that studies conducted by the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) have established that the Indian flue cured Virginia tobacco farmer does not, as yet, have an alternative to a remunerative crop like tobacco.\n\nApart from the distressing impact on farmer livelihoods, such punitive ad-valorem taxes\nwill also severely restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer world-class products to the Indian consumer.\n\nAs evidenced in the past, as cigarettes become more and more expensive due to increasing levels of taxation, tobacco consumption migrates to cheaper, revenue inefficient products like bidis and chewing tobaccos. This phenomenon sub-optimises the economic value per unit of tobacco consumption since the revenue yield from the other tobacco products is low and is declining in spite of an increase in consumption. This is borne out by the following:\n\nTobacco Consumption in Cigarette \\& Other Forms\n(Million Kgs.)\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\n  Year & Cigarettes & Others & Total \\\\\n  1981/82 & 86 & 320 & \\multirow{2}{*}{406} \\\\\n& $21 \\%$ & $79 \\%$ & \\\\\n  2005/06 & 76 & 417 & \\multirow{2}{*}{493} \\\\\n  & $15 \\%$ & $85 \\%$ & \\\\\n  Difference & -10 & +97 & +87 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nSource : USDA \\& Tobacco Institute of India\n\nExcise Duty Collected from Tobacco Products in India\n(Rs.

As highlighted in the past, sustainable tax buoyancy can be realised only by expanding the tax base as evidenced by the experience of China where, despite their per capita incomes being twice as much as India's, rates of taxes",

        "text": "REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS\non cigarettes are much lower than those in India, resulting in the Chinese tobacco sector generating as much as ten times the revenue collection from the Indian cigarette industry.\n\nHistorically, highly taxed products like cigarettes are prone to smuggling by unscrupulous international players. It is apprehended that the tax arbitrage opportunity, which is already extremely attractive, will now be enhanced by the imposition of VAT, encouraging an even greater level of smuggling of cigarettes into India. Smuggled international brands already account for about 7\\% of the market and cost the exchequer approximately Rs. 2000 crores by way of foregone taxes and foreign exchange outflow. This is bound to increase.\n\nThe scales are heavily tilted against the domestic cigarette industry on the regulatory front also. The provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, (COTPA), require that the packages of all tobacco products manufactured in the country must bear pictorial health warnings. Since the bulk of tobacco products, apart from cigarettes, are manufactured in the unorganised sector, the provisions of COTPA will, in effect, apply mainly to domestic cigarette manufacture. While smuggled stocks will, in any case, not bear such warnings, most other tobacco products could also escape these stringent legislative requirements. This will give a further fillip to the contraband market in India. While these provisions of COTPA were notified to be effective from 1st June, 2007, in response to representations from stakeholders in the industry, implementation has now been deferred to enable a Committee of Ministers to examine the issues arising from these provisions and make suitable recommendations to the Government. It is hoped that the Committee will take on board the views of all segments of the tobacco industry before framing its recommendations to ensure a fair and equitable legislative climate for all tobacco products.\n\nIndia is the third largest tobacco producer in the world. Millions of people depend on this crop for their livelihood - directly and indirectly. The\nplight of farmers in 2000/01, when, for the first time in India's history a tobacco crop-holiday was declared, is still fresh in public memory. Thereafter, relative stability in taxation has helped the farmers regain some of the lost ground. Farmer realisations improved significantly last year alongwith considerable growth in exports of tobacco and tobacco products. As noted in the Report on Tobacco Control in India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2004 - \"Tobacco occupies a prime place in the Indian economy on account of its considerable contribution to the agricultural, industrial and export sectors\". Unfortunately, harsh fiscal legislation, over time, coupled with a discriminatory regulatory framework has led to the unintended consequence of sub-optimisation of the economic potential of this important crop.\n\nWhile your Company continues to comply with the statutes in letter and in spirit, it is also engaged in dialogue with governmental agencies and policy-makers on an ongoing basis for formulation of equitable and inclusive tobacco control and taxation policies that address the interests and concerns of all stakeholders in an even-handed and sustainable manner.\n\nAs mentioned in last year's Report, the Honourable Supreme Court declared the various State luxury tax levies on cigarettes and other goods as unconstitutional. The Court further directed that if any party, after obtaining a stay order from the Court, had collected any amount towards luxury tax from its customers/consumers, such amounts should be paid to the respective State governments. Since your Company had not charged or collected any amounts towards luxury tax during the relevant period, there is no liability on the Company in this regard. However, the State of Andhra Pradesh has filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court claiming a sum of about Rs. 323.25 crores towards luxury tax, and a further sum of about Rs. 261.97 crores towards interest, on the allegation that your Company had charged and collected luxury tax from its customers, but in view of a stay order passed by the Court on 1st April, 1999, did not pay the tax to the Government. The State's contention is baseless, contrary to facts and is also contrary to the",

        "text": "\\section*{REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS}\nassessment orders passed by the State luxury tax authorities consistently holding that the Company, right from 1st March, 1997, did not charge or collect any amount towards luxury tax from its customers. Accordingly, the State's petition is being contested.\n\nThe year ahead, however, presents an extremely challenging operating ambience. In view of the bleak taxation and regulatory scenario for tobacco, exacerbated by debilitating discontinuities like VAT etc., it is quite likely that industry volumes will be under pressure. Your Company though is confident that its leadership position can be retained, even in a shrinking basket of tobacco consumption, by the vitality of its strategies and the continuing loyalty of its value seeking consumers.\n\n\\section*{FMCG - Others}\n\nAs discussed in detail in earlier years' Report of the Directors, it is the strategic intent of your Company to secure long-term growth by synergising and blending the diverse pool of competencies residing in its various businesses to exploit emerging opportunities in the FMCG sector. Your Company remains bullish on the prospects of the FMCG sector. The key demand drivers for FMCG products in India include rising disposable incomes and a favourable demographic profile; the relatively low levels of per capita consumption and penetration of these products; growing urbanisation; growing population of working women and the increasing penetration of organised retail.\n\nDuring the year under review, your Company continued to rapidly scale up the newer FMCG businesses comprising Branded Packaged Foods, Lifestyle Retailing, Greeting, Gifting \\& Stationery and Safety Matches \\& Incense Sticks (Agarbattis).\n\nIt is a matter of deep satisfaction to report that your Company continues to be the number one FMCG Company in the country in terms of distribution reach. Your Company services the largest number of markets and retail outlets in the FMCG sector across the country. This formidable distribution infrastructure is the result of strategic initiatives including deeper penetration into grocery and modern format stores, strengthening of the stationery channel and expansion of the e-Choupal based rural distribution model.\n\nThe Segment Report set out in Schedule 20 to the Accounts reflects the outcome of this rapid scaling up. Segment Revenues grew by $68 \\%$ over 2005/06 to touch Rs. 1704 crores during the year. The table below illustrates the rapid growth of these businesses over the last few years:\n\n<chart>\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nYear & Sales (Rs Crs) & PBIT/Sales \\% (RHS) \\\\\n\\hline\n2002-03 & 109 & 112 \\\\\n\\hline\n2003-04 & 304 & 57 \\\\\n\\hline\n2004-05 & 563 & 35 \\\\\n\\hline\n2005-06 & 1013 & 17 \\\\\n\\hline\n2006-07 & 1704 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n</chart>\n\n\nSegment Results reflect the gestation costs of these businesses largely comprising costs associated with brand building, product development and infrastructure creation. Highlights of progress in each category are set out below.\n\n\\section*{Branded Packaged Foods}\n\nThe Branded Packaged Foods business continued to expand rapidly with sales recording an impressive growth of $51 \\%$ over the previous year. The range of offerings now comprises more than 150 distinct food products under six brands. Your Company's unwavering commitment to internationally benchmarked quality standards enabled it to further enhance the market standing of all its brands. In terms of consumer spend, 'Aashirvaad' and 'Sunfeast' have both become more than five hundred crore rupee brands within a short span of time.\n\nThe year marked your Company's foray into the fast growing Rs. 1900 crores organised Salty Snacks market with the launch of the Bingo! range of potato chips and finger snacks. The launch, initially comprising 16 highly innovative and differentiated flavours, is backed by extensive market research leading to crafting of products/variants customised for the Indian palate. Your Company is confident of redefining this category on the strength of its insightful understanding of consumers, a robust product development strategy bolstered by the",
