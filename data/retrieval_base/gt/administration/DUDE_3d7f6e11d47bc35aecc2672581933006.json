On June 10, 1981, the Building was designated a Landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.\nE. Pursuant to Title 17 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, titled the \"Chicago Zoning Ordinance\" (\"Zoning Ordinance\"), the Property is currently zoned RM-5, Residential Multi-Unit Zoning District (\"RM-5 District\"), which is intended for multi-unit residential buildings of up to four stories.\nF. The Owner proposes to renovate the Property for a principal use as a retail gallery operated by a company that sells luxury furniture, art and home accessories, with an accessory restaurant use (\"Proposed Development\"), all as more fully described in the proposal attached to, and by this reference made a part of, this Restrictive Covenant as Exhibit B (\"Proposal\").\nG. The proposed retail use is not permitted in the RM-5 District.\nH. On May 8, 2013 the Owner filed an application with the City to amend Map No. 3-F of the Zoning Ordinance so that the Property will be located within the B3-5, Community Shopping Zoning District (\"B3-5 District\") (\"Proposed Rezoning\").\nI.

Dearborn Parkway in the City.\nL. The Neighborhood Associations initially opposed the Proposed Rezoning and the Proposed Development; however, based on the assurance by the Owner that the Property will be developed and used as set forth in the Proposal and this Restrictive Covenant, the Neighborhood Associations have assured the Owner that they would withdraw their opposition to, and support, the Proposed Rezoning and the Proposed Development.\nM. To provide such assurances in a legally binding and enforceable manner, the Owner and the Neighborhood Associations have agreed to execute, record, and be bound by this Restrictive Covenant.",
