There is much debate over the appropriateness of this charge, but at the time, OCLC concluded that the general benefit of receiving electronic orders should be paid for by the vendor.\n\nEffective immediately, OCLC is eliminating this charge to the vendors, after further evaluation and experience. While small in size, the philosophical resistance to this charge has restricted adoption by a number of small and mid-sized vendors. Having identified DX expansion and material ordering system as a way to offer efficient acquisitions services to the library community, OCLC wishes to encourage, at this early stage, participation by the vendor community. OCLC hopes that in the near term the elimination of this charge will result in a number of vendors signing on for acceptance of DXplaced orders. [OCLC]\n\nDirect Transmission - Additional Vendors Participate\n\nSixteen vendors are fully operational using Direct Transmission (DX). The sixteen are:\n1. Albion Bookshop, LSUP, Amherst, MA, US, 20027\n2. Alfred Jaeger Inc., SUBS, Commack, NY, US, 19897\n3. Baker \\& Taylor Co., Eastern Div. (NJ), 169-4901, CST SHP WHS, Somerville, NJ, US, 17234\n4. Baker \\& Taylor Co., Midwest Div. (IL), 169-2100, CST SHP WHS, Momence IL, US, 17451",

You can also query the Name-Address Directory for a list of all vendors by entering :DXT.\n\nDirect Transmission Baker \\& Taylor Orders\n\nThere is a minor problem with some of the direct transmission orders that go to Baker \\& Taylor. During the BISAC* transmission only the ISBN goes to Baker \\& Taylor. If B\\&T is not able to identify the book in their database, a report is automatically generated and sent to the library requesting additional information. OCLC and B\\&T are working to resolve this problem.\n\nIn the meantime if you receive any of these reports, do not spend any time on them. Return the forms to B\\&T. Attach a note instructing Baker \\& Taylor to contact Katherine Blauer at OCLC.\n*Note: BISAC is a fixed length format for transmission of book orders. For additional information see Acquisitions User Manual Appendix J: Direct Transmission.\n\nVendor Publisher Access To OCLC\nOCLC and Blackwell North America ( $\\mathrm{B} / \\mathrm{NA}$ ) announce to joint test to determine the viability of ongoing online access by booksellers to bibliographic information in the OCLC Online Union Catalog.\n$\\mathrm{B} / \\mathrm{NA}$ is the first book vendor to gain access to the OCLC database. During the 90 -day test, $\\mathrm{B} / \\mathrm{NA}$ will dial-in to OCLC using M300 Workstations to verify titles and International Standard Book Numbers, and to obtain other bibliographic information necessary to process orders from libraries.\n$\\mathrm{B} / \\mathrm{NA}$ is one of the 16 book vendors participating in the OCLC Direct Transmission (DX) Service, which enables OCLC Acquisitions Subsystem users to place orders electronically rather than through the mail.\n\nDuring the program $\\mathrm{B} / \\mathrm{NA}$ will maintain a daily $\\log$ of its use of the OCLC database. Information recorded will include types of search keys used, success rate in finding items, and types of materials sought. B/NA facilities here in Blackwood, NJ, will participate in the test.",

[OCLC]\n\nAcquisitions Subsystem - Purchase Order Numbers\nLibraries which use purchase order numbers in Acquisitions Subsystem orders should now enter the purchase order number in a new subfield specifically designated for purchase order numbers. The new subfield is SOURCE subfield h. Users may input purchase order numbers directly in SOURCE subfield $h$ or add the purchase order number through constant data. Consult T.B. \\#161 for additional information. [OCLC]\n\nACQ350 Testing Applicants\nEight libraries from the Network have applied to test the new ACQ350 microbased Acquisitions System. These names have been forwarded to OCLC for consideration. A decision on the test libraries will be made in a short time.\n\nACQ350 - Multi-User Capability\nThe SC350 and ACQ350 micro-based systems are designed to run on a single workstation consisting of a microcomputer and hard disk drive or on multiple workstations linked to a common database stored on a hard disk drive. For additional information on the multi-user capability, see News and Reports No. 256.\n\nLL: jma",
