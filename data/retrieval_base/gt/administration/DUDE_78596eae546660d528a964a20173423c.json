Despite the challenges FPA has encountered, it has withstood its mandate in the pursuit of serving the Filipino farmers by making available quality fertilizer and pesticide products at reasonable prices.\n\nThe completion and publication of the Fertilizer Regulatory Policies and Implementing Guidelines or the Bluebook serves as a guide to the different fertilizer industry stakeholders as well as the general public. The Bluebook outlines the guidelines and procedures for fertilizer product registration and issuance of licenses to different fertilizer handlers.\n\nIn addition, the Laboratory Services Division has been in full operation in 2013, analyzing different primary, secondary macronutrients and micronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron, manganese, zinc and other agricultural chemicals.\n\nWith strong collaboration of the FPA with the National Law Enforcement Coordinating Committee (NALECC), Philippine National Police (PNP), Department of Justice (DOJ), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the FPA was able to apprehend fertilizer and pesticide smugglers and violators, where the cases are now filed in different courts of the Philippines.\n\nWith the commitment and dedication of all FPA personnel and the cooperation of different fertilizer and pesticide stakeholders, we at the FPA, can fully attain our mandate of providing our farmers quality fertilizers and pesticides necessary to maximize farm productivity and ensure the food security of the country as well as in protecting the public from the risks inherit in the use of pesticides.\n\nThank you and more power to all!",
