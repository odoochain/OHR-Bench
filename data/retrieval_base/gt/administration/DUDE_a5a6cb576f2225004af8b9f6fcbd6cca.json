In comparison, an AR-15 round to the liver will literally pulverize it, much like dropping a watermelon onto concrete results in the destruction of the watermelon.\"\n- Dr. Ernest E. Moore\n\nWhat is an Assault Weapon?\n\nAssault weapons are semi-automatic rifles with at least one military-style feature making the weapons easier to fire more accurately and rapidly than a typical hunting rifle. [See picture on the back] Seven states have banned the sale of assault weapons, allowing reasonable exemptions for law enforcement, military members, and shooting ranges. ${ }^{1}$ Multiple federal courts have upheld these public safety bans as constitutional. ${ }^{2}$\n\n11X\nAssault Weapons are 11x more likely to be used in a mass shooting than a handgun. ${ }^{3}$ When assault weapons or high capacity magazines are used in a mass shooting, more than twice as many people are shot. ${ }^{4}$\n\n7X\nCompared to any other firearm, an assault weapon is 7 x more likely to kill law enforcement. A study analyzing FBI data showed that $20 \\%$ of the law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty from 1998 to 2001 were killed with assault weapons. ${ }^{5}$\n\n2 PERCENT\nLess than 2\\% of all Americans own assault weapons. ${ }^{6}$\n\n3,251 FPS\nThe bullet of a 9 mm handgun travels at 1,200 feet per second and delivers a kinetic energy of 400 foot pounds. By comparison, the standard AR-15 . 223 caliber bullet travels at 3,251 feet per second and delivers 1300 foot pounds. ${ }^{7}$ Tissue destruction of the AR-15 is enhanced by cavitation - the destruction of tissue beyond the direct pathway of the bullet caused by high velocity bullets with kinetic energies are over 2,500 foot pounds. ${ }^{8}$\n\nKey Support:\n\nPrime Sponsors:\n\nSen.

However, without the military-style features of an assault weapons that allow for more accurate and rapid fire, these rifles are much less deadly in mass shootings.\n8: Dr. David Shatz, a trauma surgeon at the University of California, Davis and Dr. Ernest E.
