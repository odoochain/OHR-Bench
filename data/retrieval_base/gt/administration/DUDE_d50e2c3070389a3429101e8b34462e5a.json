Requirements for the minor field vary, but might be expected to involve about six graduate-level courses in the field and one written examination, plus a portion of the University oral exam (dissertation defense). Such a program is expected to take five years. The department encourages such programs for especially able and well prepared students. See the department Graduate Handbook for more information. The following timetable would be typical for a five-year program:\n\nFirst Year: course work, almost entirely in Classics. One translation exam taken in June. One or both modern language exams taken.\n\nSecond Year: course work, both in Classics and the minor field. Second translation exam completed. French and German exams completed.\n\nThird Year: course work, both in Classics and the minor field. General examinations in Classics.\n\nFourth Year: remaining course work, both in Classics and the minor field. General examination in the minor field. Preparation for dissertation.\n\nFifth Year: dissertation, University oral examination.\n\nPH.D.

We study the processes and effects of mass communication: the nature and social role of the various media, their structure, function, and ethics, and their impact on the political system and on society. In this context, we consider not only traditional mass media (newspapers, magazines, radio, television, film), but also information technology, online media, virtual reality and the Internet. Students are trained as social scientists who can study the media, and as potential practitioners in the use of the media (in journalism, mass communications and digital media). The department combines theory and practice and fosters individual research opportunities for its students, employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches.\n\nThe Department of Communication engages in research in communication and offers curricula leading to the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. The M.A. degree prepares students for a career in journalism. The department also offers current Stanford University undergraduates a coterminal program with an M.A. emphasis in Media Studies. The Ph.D. degree leads to careers in university teaching and research-related specialties.\n\nThe Institute for Communication Research offers research experience primarily to advanced Ph.D. students.\n\nThe John S. Knight Fellowships Program brings outstanding journalists to the University to study and do research for an academic year. While here, they focus on issues, challenges and opportunities of journalism innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation sponsors twelve U.S. journalists. They are joined by eight International Fellows sponsored by the Lyle and Corrine Nelson International Fellowship Fund, the Knight Foundation, Yahoo! Inc., the Shinyoung Journalism Fund and others.\n\nADMISSION\n\nProspective Undergraduates-Applications are available online at http://admission.stanford.edu\n\nProspective Coterminal Students-Applications are available at http://registrar.stanford.edu/shared/publications.htm\\#Coterm.",

        "text": "Prospective Graduate Students-Applications are available online at at http://gradadmissions.stanford.edu.\n\nThe department requires that applicants for graduate admission submit verbal and quantitative scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Admission to each graduate degree program is competitive, based on the pool of applicants each year rather than on standard criteria that can be stated in advance. The GRE should be taken no later than early November prior to the early December application deadline.\n\nBACHELOR OF ARTS IN COMMUNICATION\n\nPREPARATION\n\nBefore declaring the major, students must have completed or be concurrently enrolled in one of the following:\nCOMM 1A or COMM 1B\nCOMM 106\nCOMM 108\nStudents interested in declaring the major should apply via Axess and meet with the student services administrator in Building 120, Room 110A, during scheduled office hours. Students are required to take at least 60 units (approximately 12 courses), not counting statistics, to complete the major.\n\nPROGRAM OF STUDY\n\nThe undergraduate curriculum is intended for liberal arts students who wish to develop an understanding of communication in society, drawing on the perspective of the social sciences. Undergraduates majoring in Communication are expected to become acquainted with the fundamental concerns, theoretical approaches and methods of the field, and to acquire advanced knowledge in one or more of the sub-areas of communication: institutions, processes, and effects.\n\nWhile the department does not attempt to provide comprehensive practical training at the undergraduate level, the curriculum provides a diverse range of internship opportunities including professional print journalism, some of which are funded by the department's Rebele Internship Program.\n\nThe department is committed to providing students with analytical and critical skills for future success in graduate programs, professional schools, or immediate career entry.\n\nThe major is structured to provide several levels of study: a core curriculum, intended to expose students to a broad-based understanding of communication theory and research, and a number of intermediate-level options and electives. Majors also have the opportunity to do advanced research in the form of senior projects and honors theses.\n\nAll undergraduate majors are required to complete a set of core communication courses which include COMM 1A, Media Technologies, People, and Society ( 5 units) or COMM 1B, Media, Culture, and Society (5 units); COMM 106, Communication Research Methods (5 units); COMM 108, Media Processes and Effects (5 units), and COMM 120, Digital Media in Society (WIM, 5 units). Core courses are usually given only once each year.\n\nThe department also requires completion of or concurrent registration in an introductory statistics course (STATS 60 or PSYCH 10) prior to registration in COMM 106, Communication Research Methods, in preparation for courses in methodology and advanced courses in communication processes and effects. It is recommended that this be done as soon as possible so as not to prevent registration in a course requiring statistical understanding. The statistics course does not count toward the 60 units to complete the Communication major.\n\nIn addition to the core courses and the statistics requirement, undergraduate majors select courses from the areas described below. Many of the courses require core courses as prerequisites. Majors select a total of four area courses, taking at least one from each area.\n\nArea I: Communication Processes and Effects-Area I emphasizes the ways in which communication scholars conduct research in, and consider the issues of, human communication. These studies aim to provide expert guidance for social policy makers and media professionals and include the following courses: COMM $160,162,166,168,169,172,326$.\n\nArea II: Communication Systems/Institutions-Area II considers the roles and interaction of institutions such as broadcasting, journalism, constitutional law, and business within communication and mass communication contexts and includes the following courses: COMM 104, 116, 117, 120, 125, 131, 136, 140, 147, 182.\n\nOptions-The Communication curriculum is designed to provide a theoretical base that can be effectively applied to numerous environments. The potential options listed below are not required, but are examples of how to focus interests.\n\n1. Communication Technologies-\na. Department of Communication (COMM):\n\nCOMM 120.

No more than 10 units of course work outside of the department, transfer credit, or Summer Session credit may be applied to meet department requirements. Communication majors must receive a letter grade for all Communication courses unless they are offered only for satisfactory/no credit (S/NC), and must maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 (C) in courses towards the major. Only courses with a grade of C - or above count towards the major.",

        "text": "HONORS PROGRAM\n\nThe honors program provides undergraduates the opportunity to undertake a significant program of research in an individual professor/student mentoring relationship. The aim is to guide students through the process of research, analysis, drafting, rethinking, and redrafting, which is essential to excellence in scholarship. Working one-on-one with a faculty adviser, seniors earn 15 Communication units, culminating in an honors thesis. In order to be eligible for the honors program, interested majors must have: (1) successfully completed both a research methods and statistics course, (2) selected an adviser, and (3) submitted an application to the department by the end of their junior year. An application may be picked up outside Room 110, Building 120.\n\nStudents are expected to make steady progress on their honors thesis throughout the year. Students who fail to submit a satisfactory draft in Autumn Quarter will be dropped from the program.\n\nA final copy of the honors thesis must be read and approved by the adviser and submitted to the department by the eighth week of Spring Quarter (exact date to be arranged). It becomes part of a permanent record held by the department. Honors work may be used to fulfill communication elective credit but must be completed and a letter grade submitted prior to graduation. A student failing to fulfill all honors requirements may still receive independent study credit for work completed, which may be applied toward fulfilling major requirements.\n\nThe designation \"with honors\" is awarded by the Department of Communication to those graduating seniors who, in addition to having completed all requirements for the Communication major:\n1. complete an honors thesis\n2. maintain a distinguished GPA in all Communication course work\n3. are recommended by the Communication faculty.\n\nMINOR IN COMMUNICATION\n\nPREPARATION\n\nBefore declaring the minor, students must have completed or be concurrently enrolled in one of the following:\n\nCOMM 1A or COMM 1B\nCOMM 106\nCOMM 108\nStudents interested in declaring the minor should do so no later than Spring Quarter of their junior year by applying via Axess and meeting with the student services administrator in Building 120, Room 110A, during scheduled office hours.\n\nPROGRAM OF STUDY\n\nThe minor is structured to provide a foundation for advanced course work in communication through a broad-based understanding of communication theory and research.\n\nStudents are required to take 35 units (approximately 7 courses), not counting statistics, to complete the minor. The curriculum consists of three introductory communication core courses that include COMM 1A (formerly COMM 1), Media Technologies, People, and Society ( 5 units), or COMM 1B, Media, Culture, and Society ( 5 units); COMM 106, Communication Research Methods (5 units); and COMM 108, Media Processes and Effects (5 units). The department also requires completion of or concurrent registration in an introductory statistics course (STATS 60 or PSYCH 10) prior to registration in COMM 106, Communication Research Methods, in preparation for courses in methodology and advanced courses in communication processes and effects. It is recommended that this be done as soon as possible so as not to prevent registration in a course requiring statistical understanding. The statistics course does not count toward the 35 units to complete the Communication minor.\n\nThe remainder of the 35 required units may be fulfilled with any intermediate-level elective Communication courses or crosslisted courses in other departments. No more than 5 units of course work outside of the department, transfer credit, or Summer Session credit may be applied to meet department requirements.\n\nCommunication minors must receive a letter grade for all Communication courses unless they are offered only for satisfactory/no credit (S/NC), and must maintain a grade point average (GPA) of $2.0(\\mathrm{C})$ in courses towards the minor. Only courses with a grade of C- or above count towards the minor. Some courses are not given every year. Refer to the Time Schedule for details.\n\nCore courses are usually offered only once annually:\nPrerequisite-introductory statistics course (for example, PSYCH 10)\n\nCore Courses-COMM 1A or 1B, 106, 108\nArea I: Communication Processes and Effects-a minimum of one course from COMM 160, 162, 166, 168, 169, 172\n\nArea II: Communication Systems/Institutions-a minimum of one course from COMM 104, 116, 117, 120, 125, 131, 136, 140, 147, 182\n\nElective courses-totaling 10 units.\n\nGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN COMMUNICATION\n\nTHE INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICATION RESEARCH\n\nThe Institute is an office of project research for the faculty of the Department of Communication and operates under grants to faculty from government, industry, and non-profit organizations. Research assistantships are often available to qualified Ph.D. students in Communication.\n\nMEDIA STUDIES COTERMINAL MASTER'S PROGRAM\n\nThe Department of Communication offers current Stanford University undergraduates a coterminal program with an M.A. emphasis in Media Studies specializing in either social sciences or journalism. For University coterminal degree program rules and University\napplication\nforms,\nhttp://registrar.stanford.edu/shared/publications.htm\\#Coterm.\nAdmission-Applications for coterminal study must be submitted at least four quarters in advance of the expected master's degree conferral date. Applicants must have earned a minimum of 120 units toward graduation (UTG) as shown on the undergraduate unofficial transcript. This includes allowable advanced placement (AP) and transfer credit. Applications must be submitted no later than November 18, 2009 for admission beginning in either Winter or Spring Quarter 2009-10 or Autumn Quarter 2010-11. Journalism track students may begin the program only in Spring Quarter of their senior year. Requirements include: Application for Admission to Coterminal Master's Program form, preliminary program proposal, statement of purpose, three letters of recommendation from Stanford professors, a written statement from a Communication professor agreeing to act as a graduate adviser (social sciences track only) and a current unofficial Stanford transcript. GRE scores are not required. Coterminal applications are submitted directly to the department. Review procedures and the Graduate Admissions Committee determine criteria.\n\nRequirements-The Media Studies coterminal master's program provides a broad introduction to scholarly literature in mass communication and offers a social sciences or journalism track. This one-year program is designed for current Stanford University undergraduates. Journalism track students may begin the program only in Spring Quarter of their senior year during which time one elective course is taken towards the master's program and any remaining requirements for the undergraduate degree are completed. In the following academic year journalism track students follow the same curriculum as students in the Graduate Program in Journalism (see Master of Arts-Journalism section), less one elective course. Social Science track students need to satisfy the following four basic requirements:\n1. Required Units and GPA: students must complete a minimum of 45 units in Communication and related areas, including items 2 and 3 below. Courses must be taken for a letter grade if offered. Courses in related areas outside the department must",

    {
        "text": "be approved by the student's adviser. A minimum of 36 units must be in the Communication department. No more than two courses (not including the statistics prerequisite) may be below the 200 level. To remain in good academic standing students must maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better. Graduation requires a GPA of 3.0 or better.\n2. Core Requirements: students must complete COMM 206, 208, and a statistics course. Typically, the statistics requirement is met with STATS 160. Other courses occasionally are approved as a substitute before the student is admitted to the program. The statistics course does not count toward the 45 units.\n3. Six Media Studies Courses: students must complete a minimum of six additional Communication courses from the following list concerned with the study of media. Not all the listed courses are offered every year, and the list may be updated from one year to the next. In addition to the core requirements and a minimum of six courses listed below, students may choose additional courses from the list and any related course approved by the student's adviser.\nCOMM 211.

The Media Studies M.A. Project: students following the social sciences track enroll in COMM 290 to complete a project over two consecutive quarters that must be pre-approved and supervised by the adviser. The completed M.A. project must be submitted to the adviser no later than the last day of classes of the second consecutive quarter.\nAdditional courses are chosen in consultation with an academic adviser.\n\nMASTER OF ARTS IN COMMUNICATION\n\nUniversity requirements for the master's degree are described in the \"Graduate Degrees\" section of this bulletin.\n\nThe department awards a terminal M.A. degree in Communication with a field of study in Journalism. Applicants for this program, and for doctoral work, are evaluated for admission on different criteria. Work to fulfill graduate degree requirements must be in courses numbered 100 or above.\n\nStanford students who are completing an M.A. degree and who desire entry into the Ph.D. program must file a Graduate Program Authorization Petition application that may be downloaded at http://registrar.stanford.edu/shared/publications.htm\\#GradStud. Such students are considered alongside all other doctoral applicants.\n\nJOURNALISM\n\nStanford's graduate program in Journalism focuses on the knowledge and skills required to report, analyze, and write authoritatively about public issues and digital media. The curriculum combines a sequence of specialized reporting and writing courses with seminars and courses devoted to deepening the students' understanding of the roles and responsibilities of American news media in their coverage of public issues.\n\nThe program emphasizes preparation for the practice of journalism and a critical perspective from which to understand it. The program's objective is twofold: (1) to graduate talented reporters and writers to foster public understanding of the significance and consequences of public issues and the debates they engender; and (2) to graduate thoughtful journalists to respond openly and eloquently when called on to explain and defend the methods of their reporting and the quality of their writing.\n\nCURRICULUM\n\nThe curriculum includes several required courses, examples of which are shown below, and a master's project:\nCOMM 216. Journalism Law\nCOMM 217. Digital Journalism\nCOMM 225. Perspectives on American Journalism\nCOMM 240. Digital Media Entrepreneurship\nCOMM 273,274. Public Issues Reporting I,II\nCOMM 275. Multimedia Storytelling\nCOMM 289. Journalism M.A. Project\nCOMM 291. Graduate Journalism Seminar\nAdditionally, students are usually required to take two specialized writing courses, chosen from a list of six or seven, and two approved electives from among graduate-level courses in the Department of Communication, or from among courses on campus that deal substantively with issues of public importance. The M.A. degree in Communication (Journalism) requires a minimum of 46 units.\n\nExcept for the Graduate Journalism Seminar and the Journalism Project, all courses must be taken for a letter grade. To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better. Graduation requires a GPA of 3.0 or better.\n\nJOURNALISM PROJECT\n\nThe Journalism master's project, a requirement for graduation, is intended as an opportunity for students to showcase their talents as writers and reporters. It is also an opportunity to undertake an in-depth critique of an area of journalism in which the author has a special interest. Work on the project usually begins during Winter Quarter and continues through Spring Quarter. Completed master's projects must be submitted to the project adviser no later than the last day of classes in the Spring Quarter. The project represents a major commitment of time, research, and writing. Although it is not a requirement that the project be published, it must be judged by a member of the faculty to be of a quality acceptable for publication. At a minimum, the project should demonstrate the rigor and discipline required of good scholarship and good journalism; it should offer ample evidence of students' ability to gather, analyze, and synthesize information in a manner that goes beyond what ordinarily appears in daily news media.\n\nDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN COMMUNICATION\n\nUniversity requirements for the Ph.D. are described in the \"Graduate Degrees\" section of this bulletin. The minimum number of academic units required for the $\\mathrm{Ph} . \\mathrm{D}$. at Stanford is 135 , up to 45 of which can be transferred either from a master's degree at the University or from another accredited institution.\n\nThe department offers a Ph.D. in Communication Theory and Research. First-year students are required to complete introductory courses in communication theory and research, research methods, and statistics. These core courses, grounded in the social science literature, emphasize how people respond to media and how media institutions function. In addition, Ph.D. students must complete a minimum of three literature survey courses and related advanced seminars in Communication. Students also take significant course work outside the department in their area of interest. Each student builds a research specialty relating communication to current faculty interests in such areas as ethics, human-computer interactions, information processing, information technology, law, online communities, politics and voting, virtual reality, and youth and",

The department accepts candidates for the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy.\n\nThe field of Comparative Literature provides students the opportunity to study imaginative literature in all its forms. While other literary disciplines focus on works of literature as parts of specific national or linguistic traditions, Comparative Literature draws on literature from all contexts in order to examine the nature of literary phenomena from around the globe and from different historical moments, while exploring how literary writing interacts with other elements of culture and society. The field studies literary expression through examinations of genres such as novels, epics, drama, and poetry, and new aesthetic forms such as cinema and electronic media. Although Comparative Literature does not restrict its focus to single traditions or periods, it does investigate the complex interplay of the literary imagination and historical experience.
