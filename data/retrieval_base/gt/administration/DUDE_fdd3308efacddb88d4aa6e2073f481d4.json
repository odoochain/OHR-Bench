The need for this vehicle for the processing of insurance applications, payments and claims, arose out of the operational and security requirements of the Agency that precluded normal application and claim submission by Agency employees. As a corollary to the requirement for a proper vehicle, CIA provides for the administration of the Government Employees Health Association as a gratuitous service to those employees availing themselves of the service. With the exception of the method of application, payment of premiums and claim submission and payment, the Group Insurance Plans available at the present time (Mutual of Omaha and Group Hospitalization Incorporated) do not differ from those offered by the same companies to the general public. The benefits are the same. \n\n Comparison of Benefits. \n\nThe attached paper, Annex I, sets forth a comparison of the benefits offered by Group Hospitalization Medical Services and the benefits offered by Mutual of Omaha. Panned changes of Mutual of Omaha. (designated as \"GEHA Present Plan,\" right-hand column) have been made to reflect increased benefits that were effective 1 Sep- tember 1953.\n\n Approved For Release 2001/03/04 : CIA-RDP80-01826R000900120012-1",
