The goal of the law is to achieve a $\\$ 15$ hourly minimum wage without adversely affecting small and seasonal businesses, so incremental rates were set to give certain employers additional time to comply. The chart below details the adjustments to New Jersey's minimum wage:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  Date & Most Employers & Seasonal \\& Small Employers (fewer than 6) & Agricultural Employers & *Cash Wage for Tipped Workers \\\\\n  January 1, 2019 & \\$8.85 & \\$8.85 & \\$8.85 & \\$2.13 \\\\\n  July 1, 2019 & \\$10.00 & NO CHANGE & NO CHANGE & \\$2.63 \\\\\n  January 1, 2020 & \\$11.00 & \\$10.30 & \\$10.30 & \\$3.13 \\\\\n  January 1, 2021 & \\$12.00 & \\$11.10 & NO CHANGE & \\$4.13 \\\\\n  January 1, 2022 & \\$13.00 & \\$11.90 & \\$10.90 & \\$5.13 \\\\\n  January 1, 2023 & \\$14.00 & \\$12.70 & \\$11.70 & NO CHANGE \\\\\n  January 1, 2024 & \\$15.00 & \\$13.50 & \\$12.50 & NO CHANGE \\\\\n  January 1, 2025 & TBD & \\$14.30 & \\$13.40 & TBD \\\\\n  January 1, 2026 & TBD & \\$15.00 & \\$14.20 & TBD \\\\\n  January 1, 2027 & TBD & TBD & \\$15.00 & TBD \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n* Cash wage plus tips must equal the minimum wage.
