        "text": "MESSAGE OF THE\n\nExecutive Director\n\nIt is my honor and privilege to report the accomplishments of the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) for the year 2012. The FPA as a regulatory agency continues to strive for quality services for its clientele, true to its mandate in making available fertilizer and pesticide for the use of farmers in food production to achieve the twin goals of food sufficiency and food security.\n\nThe year 2012 was a challenging year for FPA as it carried its plans and strategies in pursuit of our mission brought forth with the implementation of the Rationalization Program that brought mixed reactions of optimism and apprehensions in the agency. Despite these reactions, FPA vigorously pursued its mandate.\n\nWe are happy to report that our field personnel although limited in number were able to enforce the rules provided under PD 1144 and apprehend violators particularly those involved in the adulteration of fertilizer, and the sale of unregistered/smuggled pesticides. Our strong linkage with the Philippine National Police, Department of Justice, National Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Customs, the Fertilizer Industry Association of the Philippines, and the pesticide industry associations (CPAP, CROPLIFE and PICMA) has proven very effective on its enforcement of the rules.\n\nThe operationalization of the FPA fertilizer analytical laboratory has indeed been an effective tool in the analysis of the confiscated fertilizer that provided material evidences in the investigation of adulterated fertilizers. The laboratory is also a great help in confirmatory analysis of samples from registrants and those samples gathered during the monitoring of the FPA field personnel.\n\nWe are happy to report that the Bluebook which is the Fertilizer Implementing Guidelines has been finalized and will be available for distribution in the early part of 2013. We thank our fertilizer consultants, fertilizer industry, the FPA staff who have been involved in the formulation of the Bluebook for their contribution.\n\nWe took pride also for the commendation of the FPA by the Bureau of Customs in the implementation of the Philippine National Single Window which was a showcase of success to other countries, The PNSW has facilitated import permit\n\ntransactions of FPA licensed importers of fertilizer and pesticide products shortening the processing time.\n\nOur accomplishment cannot be realized without the cooperation and support of the stakeholders. The FPA thank them for their unwavering support. I believe that there is no compromise when it comes to the importance of our stakeholders since they are our partners in agriculture in making fertilizer and pesticide available to Filipino farmers.\n\nThe FPA is not spared of challenges but with the commitment, cooperation and enthusiasm of each of its employee, they can be responded accordingly.\n\nIn 2014, we look forward to improve the agency's services through capacity building-staff development and logistical support. In the light of the implementation of the Rationalization Program, we are optimistic that we will be able to streamline and improve our regulatory services provided that we have the right people in the right position to do the work. We look forward also to the operationalization of our Pesticide Analytical Laboratory and our international role and commitment such as the ASEAN harmonization of the MRL and pesticide regulations.\n\nMore power to all of us!",

FPA continues to give the farmers and the consuming public an array of registered quality fertilizer and pesticide products in accordance to their needs.\n\nFertilizer and pesticide product quality standards is one of the main concern of the Authority. On this context, the FPA has operationalized the Fertilizer Analytical Laboratory Services. Fertilizer laboratory that caters to all for guaranteed analysis of product samples submitted by clients prior to product registration and license approval, and for quality monitoring. The establishment of the Pesticide Laboratory is on-going and will soon be operationalized. The laboratory equipment have already been purchased, ready for installation as soon as the electrical and other facilities have been completed.",

For new fertilizer license applications, there were 747 licenses processed and approved or $78 \\%$ accomplishment out of the 947 targeted. The decrease is due to closure of many dealers/cooperatives because of financial constraints. For pesticide, there were 567 applications processed and approved or $135 \\%$ accomplishment out of the 421 applications targeted for the year.\n\nThe delegation of authority in the renewal of permits and licenses to the different FPA Regional Offices have streamlined the processing time. There were 1,507 applications for license renewals that were approved at the FPA regional offices.\n\nThe accreditation of stakeholders allow more players in the playing field to make available fertilizer and pesticide products to farmers at reasonable/competitive price for FPA licensed establishments. Accreditation is through training and examination.

It has been proven that processing has shortened the application permits to import and export fertilizer and pesticide. There were 4,037 fertilizer and pesticide regulatory applications for Certificate Authorizing for Imports of Pesticide (CAIP) and VAT Exemption that were lodged in the NSW system that have been approved at a prescribed time, or shorter than the prescribed time.\n\nField Monitoring\n\nThe enforcement of FPA regulatory functions pursuant to P.D. 1144 has been strictly implemented. The FPA field personnel vigilantly conducted monitoring activities, inspection visits to fertilizer and pesticide handlers.\n\nThere were 281 clean-up drives conducted in the regions and provinces. As a result, there were 645 establishments found to have violated FPA rules and\n regulations. Consequently, 19 establishments of whom were given the corresponding \"Stop Sales, Stop Use, Stop Move Order (SUMs) and were imposed appropriate sanctions.\n\nThere were 544 Pest Control Operators (PCOs), and 235 establishments using pesticide impregnated plastics monitored and inspected for the year 2012.\n\nIn line with the occupational health and safety monitoring on fertilizer and pesticide production, there were seven (3) fertilizer, and forty our ( 44 ) pesticide plants visited as requirement for registration and post registration/licensing.",

The said data are used as reference by the general public, investors and banks.\n\nThe results of vigilant monitoring of FPA field personnel resulted to the confiscation of an estimated amount of P37.8 million unregistered/smuggled pesticide products in Region III. Also, salt adulterated fertilizers were seized in Regions XI and XII. The FPA has been working closely with the Philippine National Police (Criminal, Investigation and Detection Group), Bureau of Customs and the Department of Justice specifically the National Bureau of Investigation with regard to enforcement. Court cases have been filed against the violators.\n\nFollowing the phase-out of Methyl Bromide for Non-Quarantine Pre-Shipment (NQPS) use, the monitoring system on consumption of Methyl Bromide for Quarantine Pre-Shipment (QPS) use has been institutionalized through the issuance of the Department of Agriculture of Administrative Order No. 17 last 16 August 2010. The said AO provides the adoption of the logbook system in monitoring the usage of Methyl Bromide. FPA in compliance to the Montreal Protocol strictly monitors the usage of methyl bromide. Permit to purchase is processed and approved subject to the submission of authenticated logbook. For the year 2012, there were 234 Permits to Purchase Methyl Bromide approved for QPS use.",
