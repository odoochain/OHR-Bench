How to Make a FOIA Request.\n\nFor basic information about how to make a FOIA request, please visit our Web site at www.hud.gov.\nA. For the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all offices that receive FOIA requests, visit our Web site at www.hud.gov.\nB. Brief description of HUD's response time ranges.\n\nBecause the FOIA process is decentralized at HUD, the response time will vary from office to office depending on the complexity of the request and on the FOIA workload of the office which is processing the request. The response time for the majority of requests handled by the HUD field offices is within the 20 working days provided by statute. In HUD Headquarters, there is a backlog of between 250 and 300 FOIA requests. Requests are processed on a multi-track system. Some routine requests are processed within 20 working days, but the average processing time for such requests is 45 days. The average time for processing complex requests is between 60 and 90 days.\nC. Brief description of why FOIA requests are not granted.\n\nThe most frequent reason that a FOIA request is not granted is that no documents responsive to the request were located.\n\nThe primary reasons for not granting a request where documents could be located is that disclosure would result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or that the records are protected by the deliberative process, attorney-client, or attorney work product privilege.\n\nIII. Definitions of Terms and Acronyms Used in the Report.\nA. Agency-specific acronyms or other terms are as follows.\n1. HUD - Department of Housing and Urban Development",
