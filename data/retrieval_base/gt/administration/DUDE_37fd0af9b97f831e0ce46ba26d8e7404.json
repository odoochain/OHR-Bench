CoCs are required to provide an unduplicated count of homeless persons according to HUD standards (explained in HUD's two guides to Counting Sheltered and Unsheltered Homeless People at https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/counting_unsheltered.pdf). HUD has conducted a limited data quality review but has not independently verified all of the information submitted by each CoC. The reader is therefore cautioned that since compliance with these standards may vary, the reliability and consistency of the homeless counts may also vary among CoCs. Additionally, a shift in the methodology a CoC uses to count the homeless may cause a change in homeless counts between reporting periods.\n\nLA-503 New Orleans/Jefferson Parish CoC\n\nPoint-in Time Date: 3/31/2014\n\nSummary by household type reported:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}\n\\multicolumn{5}{c}{ Sheltered } \\\\\n& Emergency Shelter & Transitional Housing* & Unsheltered & Total \\\\\nHouseholds without children$^{1}$ & 523 & 289 & 794 & 1,606 \\\\\nHouseholds with at least one adult and one child$^{2}$ & 19 & 72 & 0 & 91 \\\\\nHouseholds with only children$^{3}$ & 13 & 37 & 4 & 54 \\\\\n  Total Homeless Households & 555 & 398 & 798 & 1,751 \\\\\n  Persons in households without children$^{4}$ & 523 & 304 & 810 & 1,637 \\\\\nPersons Age 18 to 24 & 86 & 44 & 124 & 254 \\\\\nPersons Over Age 24 & 437 & 260 & 686 & 1,383 \\\\\n  Persons in households with at least one adult and one child$^{2}$ & 57 & 229 & 0 & 286 \\\\\nChildren Under Age 18 & 36 & 126 & 0 & 162 \\\\\nPersons Age 18 to 24 & 6 & 30 & 0 & 36 \\\\\nPersons Over Age 24 & 15 & 73 & 0 & 88 \\\\\n  Persons in households with only children$^{3}$ & 13 & 37 & 8 & 58 \\\\\n  Total Homeless Persons & 593 & 570 & 818 & 1,981 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nSummary of homeless persons by subpopulations reported:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c}\n& Sheltered & Unsheltered & Total Population \\\\\nChronically Homeless & 77 & 395 & 472 \\\\\nChronically Homeless Individuals & 70 & 395 & 465 \\\\\nChronically Homeless Persons in Families & 7 & 0 & 7 \\\\\nSeverely Mentally Ill & 193 & 379 & 572 \\\\\nChronic Substance Abuse & 249 & 465 & 714 \\\\\nVeterans & 126 & 67 & 193 \\\\\nHIV/AIDS & 49 & 19 & 68 \\\\\nVictims of Domestic Violence & 120 & 89 & 209 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\n* Safe Haven programs are included in the Transitional Housing category\n\n${ }^{1}$ This category includes single adults, adult couples with no children, and groups of adults.\n${ }^{2}$ This category includes households with one adult and at least one child under age 18 .\n${ }^{3}$ This category includes persons under age 18, including children in one-child households, adolescent parents and their children, adolescent siblings, or other household configurations composed only of children",
