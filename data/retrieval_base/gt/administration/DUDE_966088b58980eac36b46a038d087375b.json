One major objective was to develop training materials for PSRO staffs and for hospital personnel responsible for collecting and using PHDDS at delegated hospitals. Resulting new materials have been combined with revised Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) instructional materials to provide complete instructions for all parts of the PHDDS. Contributors to this project are listed below:\n\nJames P. Cooney Jr., Ph.D. Executive Director Rhode Island Health Services Research, Inc. Formerly Associate Director HRET\n\nMary E.

Designed to assist hospitals in UHDDS collecting and use, it was developed and tested in cooperation with the American College of Life Underwriters (ACLU) between 1971 and 1973.

For a patient--such as a newborn or child--without a social security number but with Medicaid coverage, use his/her recipient identification number. If the hospital assigns a different medical record number, it is also to be furnished. The patient's name is not to be recorded.\n\nRESIDENCE: 2IP code\nDATE OF BIRTH: month, day, and year of birth\nSEX: male or female\nRACE: White, Black, or Other\nADMISSION DATE: month, day, year, and hour (00-23) of admission\nDISCHARGE DATE: month, day, and year of discharge\nPHYSICIAN IDENTIFICATION: the physician's social security number. The attending physician and the operating physician are to be identified.\n\nAttending Physician: the physician primarily responsible for the patient's care from the beginning of this hospital episode\n\nOperating Physician: the physician who performs the principal procedure\n\nDIAGNOSIS: all diagnoses that affect the current stay. Old diagnoses that relate to an earlier episode and have no bearing on this hospital stay are excluded.\n\nPrincipal diagnosis (to be designated): the condition established, after study, as the chief reason for the patient's admission. PSROs are required to report the ICDA-8 or H-ICDA-2 code for the principal diagnosis.\n\nOther Diagnoses: all conditions that coexist at the time of admission or develop subsequently and that affect the treatment and/or the length of stay.\n\nPROCEDURES AND DATES: all procedures performed in operating rooms are to be reported with the dates. In addition, all other significant procedures are to be recorded with the dates. A significant procedure is one that carries an operative or anesthetic risk that requires highly trained personnel or special facilities or equipment. Some examples are: cardio-catheterization, renal dialysis, angiography, 'exchange transfusion, endoscopy, encephalography, and supervoltage radiation therapy. When two or more procedures are recorded, the principal procedure is to be designated. In determining the principal",

When numerical information about a patient is to be retrieved from a list referenced by the patient's name, always:\na) check to make certain that the correct numbers have been retrieved; that is, that the numbers you record are the ones associated with that particular patient.\nb) check the full name of the patient, including middle initial, to make certain you are retrieving the right information.",

Mark the letter corresponding to your choice.\n1. As long as PSRO personnel have ample training in recording data, their motivation for accuracy and care in recording is relatively unimportant.\n2. Whenever possible, data should be recorded in the same manner throughout the PSRO area.\n3. A discharge summary form is a single document, capable of containing all the relevant patient discharge data.\n4. Since nost persons write numbers in almost the same fashion, it is not necessary to worry about uniformity in numbering style.\n5. Rules should be established regarding the type of writing implement acceptable for recording information.\n6. Rules should be established regarding the PSRO procedures to be followed in correcting errors made while recording.\n7. PSRO-wide unfformity in data recording, although desirable, should not be expected since it's virtually impossible to attain.\n8. When recording a number that has fewer digits than the number of spaces allocated, such as recording a four-digit number in a five-block space, it doesn't matter which four of the five blocks are used. Whether the number \" 5962 \" is recorded as [05962] or [59620], the data processor would read the number correctly as 5962.\n(T) (F)\n* * * * *\n\nFor questions 9 and 10 , complete the statement by filling in each blank with the appropriate words:\n9.

The hospital population is categorized as either inpatients or outpatients with further delineation to describe the clinical care unit* that provided the inpatient or outpatient services, such as the emergency department, clinics, home care program, day or night center, short-term care unit, long-term care unit, and others.\n\nPHDDS, PART A, THE UNIFORM HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA SET, DELINEATES THE POPULATION FOR WHICH DATA ARE TO BE COLLECTED: EVERY INPATIENT DISCHARGED FROM A SHORT-TERM CARE HOSPITAL OR THE SHORT-TERM UNIT OF A HOSPITAL.\n\nDefinitions with guidelines to follow are:\nINPATIENT: A patient who is provided with room, board, and continuous nursing service in an area of the hospital where patients generally stay overnight. Exceptions are those inpatients who die or are discharged before midnight (census-taking time) or those patients who utilize distinctive inpatient services other than room and board but who die or are transferred to another medical care institution.\n\nEach of the following would be considered an inpatient:\n- A patient who was transferred from the emergency department to operating suite and died during or immediately following surgery\n- A patient who received a battery of hospital services--x-rays, inhalation therapy, whole blood, laboratory tests, medicines, or intensive nursing services--but died before transfer to an inpatient bed area\n- A patient who was admitted and received diagnostic work-up, then eloped or left the hospital against the physician's advice\n- A patient who was taken from the emergency department to the operating suite and immediately following emergency surgery was transferred to another medical care institution\n- A hospital live birth* (newborn)\n\nNOTE: In some instances, a patient may be detained in the emergency department for close observation over an extended period. Depending on the emergency service facilities, the length of time, and the hospital's policy, this may be considered an inpatient admission. Your hospital's policy regarding such admissions should prevail.",

(Referred to as a hospital boarder.)\n\nNOTE: Even if the term boarder is used to describe a newborn infant who remains in the hospital or in the newborn nursery after his mother's discharge, the infant is a hospital inpatient, and not a boarder.\n- A stillbirth or hospital fetal death*.\n- A person for whom patient-care orders, diagnostic work-up, or treatment was cancelled immediately after his admission, either by himself or by his physician, and to whom no bill for hospital services was submitted. (This would constitute a cancellation of admission.)\n- An emergency service patient who was immediately transferred to the operating room but who died before a surgical procedure was performed.\n\nINPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION: Uninterrupted period as an inpatient, with the possible exception of authorized leaves of absence. It is identified by its beginning (inpatient admission*) and its end (inpatient discharge*).\n\nIf the hospital has separate units for short-term care and long-term (or extended) care, the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set requires separate reporting of short-term unit* and long-term unit* hospitalization.\n- If a patient is admitted to the short-term unit and subsequently transferred to the long-term or extended care unit, use the date of transfer as the discharge date for the short-term unit reporting.\n- If a patient is admitted to the long-term or extended care unit and subsequently transferred to the short-term unit, use the date of transfer as the admission date for the short-term unit reporting.\n\nINPATIENT DISCHARGE: The end of inpatient hospitalization:\n- By order of the physician\n- By death of the patient\n- Against medical advice\n- By transfer to hospital-based extended care unit (long-term unit)\n\n\n* See Glossary\n\n(Rev. 10/75)",
