A couple of years ago I asked that an employee's handbook be put out that would help people understand about the Agency and make them feel welcome when they first join. The initial cut on it was not very satisfactory. They have now made a fine effort to redo it, but it comes off rather more bureaucratic than I think we want if we're going to go to this expense. I'd like to:\na. Warm it up;\nb. Unstultify the language;\nc. Eliminate details that really aren't of interest to the average new employee (we're really writing this for the people coming in at the bottom of their specialties). (U)\n2. For instance, in describing what the CIA does, it seems to me we could be a little more imaginative and warm in the description. Just listing the offices doesn't seem to do much for me, and besides that we list the independent offices ahead of the main directorates, three of which are line activities. (U)\n3. You'll have some problems because we do have to be accurate, but when we tell people they get paid every two weeks except some people get paid every four weeks and some of them don't get paid at all, it is going to confuse people who will have no idea into which category they fall. I suspect a very, very high percentage fit into the every two weeks category, and we could leave it at that with some statement like, \"Ninety-five percent are paid every two weeks.\" (U)\n4. We really want some pitch in here also, preferably at the beginning, to build up esprit de corps and a sense of eliteness of coming into the Agency. If this doesn't make people more enthusiastic about the decision they have made to join, we shouldn't put it out. (U)\n5. This has been going on a long time so there is no big rush. (U)",
