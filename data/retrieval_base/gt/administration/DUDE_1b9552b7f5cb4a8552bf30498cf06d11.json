        "text": "GAMES AND AMUSENEENTS BOARD\n\nThe Games and Amusements Board (GAB), an agency attached to the Office of the President, is vested with supervisory and regulatory authority over professional sports and games in the Philippines. It was created as part of the government reorganization in 1951 pursuant to Executive Order 392 entitled \"Further Reorganizing the Different Executive Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and Agencies of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, Making Certain Readjustments of Personnel and Reallotments of Funds in Connection Therewith, and For Other Purposes.\"\n\nACCOMIPLSERMETETS\n\nCY 2016\n\nOFPICE OR THE CHAIRMAN AND CONHMSSIONERS\n\nThe Board is composed of Chairman Abraham Kahlil B. Mitra, Commissioner Eduard B. Trinidad and Commissioner Matthew P. Gaston. Through their guidance, the GAB was able to accomplish its target for CY2016 which shall be presented in the preceding portions of this report.\n\nAside from the targets set forth and approved by the Department of Budget and Management, hereunder are the accomplishments of GAB, to wit:\n1. GAB Anti-HIlegal Gambling Consultation Meeting. On August 3, 2016, the GAB, in coordination with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), met with the representatives from PAGCOR, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, Philippine Racing Commission, National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine National Police's Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and Anti-Cybercrime Group at the PAGCOR Office in Manila, to discuss the issues of illegal gambling in the country. Agencies presented their reports and concerns on illegal gambling and assured their full cooperation and support to the government's campaign against illegal gambling.\n\nThe GAB-AIGU was created by then President Corazon C. Aquino, through Administrative Order No. 262, series of 1992 and later strengthened by then President Fidel V. Ramos through AO No. 222 s. 1995. GAB-AIGU was specifically created to combat and prevent the existence and proliferation of illegal bookie joints and other illegal forms of organized gambling in professional sports and games. Since the last quarter of 2011, GAB-AIGU was not able to conduct anti-illegal gambling operations up to the present due to non-renewal or non-extension of detail of PNP personnel due to the depleted number of PNP personnel who shall be distributed and deployed to frontline units, leaving GAB-AIGU with its mandate without legal enforcement personnel to properly implement and execute the same.\n\nIn November and December 2016, the GAB sent requests to DILG to provide CIDG personnel to assist the GAB in its anti-illegal gambling operations.\n\nIn the meantime that no law enforcement personnel are detailed to GAB, any reports of illegal gambling activities received by GAB are being referred to PNP for appropriate action.",
