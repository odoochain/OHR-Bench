LEONARD L. BOSWELL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM IOWA\n\nThe Chairman. I would like to call the meeting to order.\nWelcome, everybody. I say in the beginning that my friend, Ranking Member, Jerry has had a death in the family and may show up late. I am not sure just yet.\n\nI also have my next door neighbor, Mr. Sam Graves, here. A state line divides us, I guess, but we have known each other a long time. We both like to talk about airplanes. In fact, we have already done it this morning, haven't we Sam?\n\nMr. Graves. Yes, we have.\nThe Chairman. Anyway we will come to order, and I would like to thank you for being here as we review the state of the crop insurance industry.\n\nI would like to thank the witnesses. Of course, when we have somebody from the home state here, we are always kind of pleased about that. We all look forward to these opportunities; and I want to give a welcome to the two Iowans who will be on the second panel, Mr. Rutledge and Mr. Dalton, for making the trip. Being from Iowa, the state with over 92,000 farms and over 30 million acres in production, we understand the challenges that farmers in that agriculture business face.\n\nYou probably heard this too many times, but it has been quite an impact on me, so I will keep telling it.

My, my, how it had changed, big time.\n\nI already knew-I always knew that, at least the size of the operation that I was involved in, and all sizes, actually, there are a couple of things you have to have. It is so capital intensive, you have to have a good banker you can work with; and, of course, you have to have the farmer store to buy and sell your product. You just have to have both.\n\nThen we went through the farm crisis in the late 1970s, early 1980s. Down in our part of the country we had banks closing, and it was tough. It was a tough time, and a lot didn't survive it. A lot of the neighbors I had did not survive.\n\nI had moved into the Iowa Legislature, and I had-Sam, I had five banks in my Senate district that went down. It was like a death in the family when that happens in a community. Throughout all that something else emerged, and that was the realization that you had to have a third element that had not been pursued too much and that was a good insurance program with a good insurance agent to help you manage your risk. So I and many others utilized that and didn't want to go back to what we just went through.\n\nSo I share that story because I understand the importance of the crop insurance industry, not just in our state but across the country. Last year alone, 265 million acres were enrolled in crop insurance. Sign-up and buy-up levels for crop insurance levels are at an all-time high, understandably so, proving that farmers appreciate having additional options to help them manage risk. However, certain regions and certain crops are under-represented. So, trying to look ahead, we need to see how we can make this program work for more producers.\n\nInitially, I have to say cutting funding for the program makes the task a lot more difficult. Budgets are tight, but tight budgets do not mean we must jeopardize the risk management tools that we have today, or put in question what improvements we can make in the future.\n\nWe have been very concerned at the level of cuts proposed by RMA through the standard renegotiation agreement, the SRA process. While I believe the national deficit is one of the most pressing issues facing our nation, we must not pull the rug out from under our farmers and ranchers to address the issue.\n\nOver $\\$ 5$ billion taken out of the crop insurance program in the 2008 Farm Bill and now an additional $\\$ 6$ billion removed through this SRA, I ask is there enough left to ensure farmers have access to affordable coverage, while trying to expand the program for crops for which it currently is not a viable option.\n\nWe must also acknowledge that the crop insurance industry is a business, and both the companies and agents need to make a profit in order to stay in the market and to stay in business. We can't begrudge them that. However, it is also the Committee's job to guarantee that every cent of taxpayer money spent in the program is spent wisely, and truly goes to provide a safety net for our producers.",

Boswell, a Representative in Congress from Iowa\n\nI would like to thank everyone for joining us here today as we review the state of the crop insurance industry. I would especially like to thank our witnesses. A very warm welcome to the two Iowans on the panel, Mr. Rutledge and Mr. Dalton, for making the trip to D.C. This Committee looks forward to hearing your valuable insight.\n\nBeing from Iowa-a state with over 92,000 farms and over 30 million acres in production-I understand the challenges that farmers and those in the agriculture business face today.\n\nWhen I retired from the Army and returned home to Iowa and to farm, I quickly realized that farming had greatly changed during the 20 years I was away. Back then, I had always said that in order to farm, producers needed to have access to a bank and a place to sell their product. After surviving the farm crisis in the 1980's, I also realized the importance of a good crop insurance agent to help me to manage my risk. I worked with an agent in my area to ensure that I was never put in the position that I was in during the 1980's farm crisis again.\n\nI shared that story because I understand the importance of the crop insurance industry not only in my State of Iowa but across the country. Last year alone 265 million acres were enrolled in crop insurance.\n\nSign-up and buy-up levels for crop insurance products are at an all-time high, proving that farmers appreciate having additional options to help them manage risk. However, certain regions and certain crops are under-represented. Looking ahead, we need to see how we can make this program work for more producers. Additionally, I have to say that cutting funding of the program makes that task much more difficult. Budgets are tight, but tight budgets do not mean we must jeopardize the risk management tools that we have today or put in question what improvements we can make in the future.\nI have been very concerned with the level of cuts proposed by the RMA through the Standard Renegotiation Agreement (SRA) process.

        "text": "Despite the creation of new commodities support and disaster assistance programs in the 2008 Farm Bill, agriculture producers in my district and in many other Congressional districts continue to rely on traditional farm programs and crop insurance to meet their risk management needs.\n\nAgriculture producers need options to take into account the various and unique characteristics of their individual operations. The crop insurance industry has often been a source of innovation in developing products to meet these needs. Unfortunately, the recently enacted SRA reduces the farm safety net by some $\\$ 6$ billion. I think many on this Committee would agree that the run-up in A\\&O in 2008 was a problem that needed to be addressed, but there were other strategies available that would not have so deeply impacted the farm safety net baseline.\n\nMr. Chairman, I think you summed things up pretty well; and, with that, I, too, am looking forward to hearing the testimony today and look forward to hearing what the witnesses have to say.\n\nThe Chairman. Well, thank you very much.\nI see we have been joined by Mr. Lucas from Oklahoma, the Ranking Member of the full Committee, and would recognize Frank for any statements you might want to make.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK D. LUCAS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM OKLAHOMA\n\nMr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. And I want to thank Administrator Murphy and all the panelists for being here today.\n\nI do wonder why we are having a hearing a week after companies basically have had a take-it-or-leave-it scenario thrust before them. The airing of some of these concerns would have been much more productive if they were not happening after the fact.\n\nAs the Department likes to point out, all 16 companies did sign the new SRA, but the signing of the agreement should not imply that the companies agree with the terms. If a company did not sign the document, the company would simply cease to exist, and thousands of people would be out of jobs.\n\nA number of troubling items have arisen out of this Standard Renegotiation Agreement, and I think this Committee needs to take a serious look at the precedent that this renegotiation has set, and whether Congress needs to set stronger parameters of what changes can be made in future agreements.\n\nAs the Administrator will tell us, Congress gave the Department discretion to renegotiate this agreement, but I am not sure that these wholesale changes were envisioned when that discretion was given in the 2008 Farm Bill. As one of our witnesses points out today, this power of the purse is and should be reserved to Congress. This duty was usurped by the Department in this case.\n\nIn the field hearing the Chairman held this spring, the importance of the crop insurance program to producers was reiterated time and time again. I worry that these huge cuts might imperil the delivery system that our producers depend upon.\n\nIn the 2008 Farm Bill, Congress made cuts to the program totaling around $\\$ 6$ billion. I don't think anyone involved in those negotiations thought that less than 2 years later the Department would",

Yes, they are gone from the baseline.\n\nIn addition, I worry about some of the last-minute provisions to the agreement, including the hard cap on agent commissions, limiting the ability of companies to sue, and a change in the A\\&O formula that generally affects my great State of Oklahoma.\n\nI do, though, commend Administrator Murphy, though, as he has consistently been up front and engaging in this process. I appreciate the open lines of communication that he and his office have shown to the Members of this Committee. I believe you were given an almost impossible job, sir, and you performed it admirably, considering everything.\n\nWith that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Lucas; and I appreciate what you just said.\n\nMr. Moran and I work very close together on trying to set these timetables, and your point is well taken about the timing. However, both Jerry and myself and probably you, since I know you pretty well, have been in contact with Mr. Murphy, so your point is well taken. I do remind us all that we do have some say in this before it is all said and done, so that is what we are trying to go through as we have this hearing today.\n\nWith that, I would ask that the rest of the Members present would follow standard procedure and request that they submit their opening statements for the record so we can begin the testimony and have ample time for questions.\n[The prepared statements of Mr. Peterson and Mr. Moran follow:]\n\nPrepared Statement of Hon. Collin C. Peterson, a Representative in Congress from Minnesota\n\nThank you, Chairman Boswell, for holding this hearing today to take a look at where things stand in terms of the crop insurance industry.\n\nThis hearing is particularly timely as the U.S. Department of Agriculture has just finished the process of renegotiating the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with the companies that provide crop insurance coverage to farmers and ranchers. Many people have a lot of opinions about how that process was carried out and what the outcome will be for farmers.\n\nAs a result of the SRA renegotiation, $\\$ 4$ billion will go to reducing the Federal deficit and $\\$ 2$ billion will go into improving risk management and conservation programs. As everyone knows, I am a strong supporter of reducing the Federal budget deficit because we are simply on an unsustainable path right now. And I want it to be noted that agriculture was first in line to contribute savings to the deficit, and the contribution of $\\$ 4$ billion was significant. If every other part of government followed this example and found a proportionate amount of savings in their programs, we could make some serious headway against the debt crisis we are facing in this country.\n\nIn the 2008 Farm Bill, we asked USDA to renegotiate the SRA, and that's what they have done. Many of us did not expect that as a result of those negotiations, there would be $\\$ 6$ billion in savings. I understand that there are concerns about how such a large change in the SRA could impact the delivery of crop insurance to farmers. We have some time between now and when we write the 2012 Farm",

        "text": "Bill, and if we see that the SRA is having an adverse effect on farmers, we could make some modifications at that time to address any problems that come up.\n\nAgain, thank you Chairman Boswell for holding this timely hearing today, and I look forward to the testimony.\n\nPrepared Statement of Hon. Jerry Moran, a Representative in Congress from Kansas\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. Given the recent events in the crop insurance industry, chiefly the signing of the 2011 Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA), it is important that we hold this hearing. While I am disappointed that we did not hold this hearing before the SRA was completed, which would have enabled Members of the Committee to publicly put their concerns and objections on record before RMA arrived at the final agreement terms, I am glad we have that opportunity now. Congress must exercise its oversight authority and doing so now will give us an idea about what parts of the SRA we must closely monitor as it is implemented.\n\nCompared to the first draft of the SRA released by the Risk Management Agency (RMA) in December of 2009, I believe the final draft is much improved. However, I do not want this to be misconstrued as me giving the 2011 SRA my stamp of approval. In fact, I continue to have significant concerns about the substance of the agreement. I am worried not only how it could adversely impact service to the agricultural producer, but also how it will affect the vitality of the existing crop insurance industry.\n\nWhile I plan to discuss my concerns further during the question period, I would like to highlight some initial issues. First, despite promises from Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack that he would work with the Committee to protect the budget baseline for the next Farm Bill, it appears there was no real attempt made by the Department to fulfill this promise. While the Department reduced its program cuts from $\\$ 8.4$ billion to $\\$ 6$ billion, it appears none of that funding will remain available to the Committee to assist it in writing the 2012 Farm Bill. Furthermore, the Department has set a dangerous precedent of taking funds from a commodity program to support two mandatory conservation programs in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). When the last farm bill was written, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) made assumptions about the cost of these programs, and in regard to CRP, assumed the program would be operated at near capacity for the life of the farm bill. This included the reenrollment of new and expiring CRP acres. It is perplexing why the Department now thinks it necessary to find additional offsets to run the program as Congress intended. If this example is followed, every time a CRP general signup is held, the Department is going to look for another way to reduce the producer safety net. Let me be clear, this is not what Congress intended.\n\nSecond, while Congress directed RMA to examine different methods of calculating the Administrative and Operating (A\\&O) subsidy, it did not direct RMA to restrict agent commissions. Agent commissions are an internal business decision of private companies. Often these agreements are made with independent agent contractors. RMA's decision to interfere with agent commissions is an unnecessary and unauthorized intrusion of government into a private business model. While crop insurance is a construct of the Federal Government, it was purposefully setup to operate through the use of a private delivery system. I worry that restrictions on agent commissions will eventually lead to a decrease in service to farmers and ranchers.\n\nThird, I have significant concerns that subparagraph III(a)(2)(K) of the 2011 SRA is an unauthorized restriction of the legal rights of not only companies who are participants in the SRA, but also agents who are not party to the agreement. I suspect that most courts would find such a provision to constitute a contract of adhesion and the provisions stricken upon legal challenge. It is troublesome that an Administration that advertises its commitment to transparency and equity would unilaterally try to cut off the legal rights of insurance companies and agents. It is especially troublesome that this provision was added at the last minute with little open debate or negotiation. The addition of such a provision begs the question: \"What is the Department trying to hide?\"\n\nFinally, I am concerned about the overall shifting of risk in this SRA from the private insurance and reinsurance industry to the government and ultimately the taxpayer. If RMA is concerned that profits in the crop insurance industry were getting excessive, why not move the program toward a more market oriented model. For example, rather than the government taking a greater share of the more profitable policies from the companies through realignment of the commercial funds, why",

        "text": "not simply transfer a greater share of the riskier policies to the companies, while allowing the companies to retain the more profitable polices. This would enable the companies greater upside potential, while also allowing the companies, through reinsurance, to spread risk across the industry.\n\nI hope these topics will be addressed by RMA in its testimony and I look forward to further discussion throughout the hearing today.\n\nThe Chairman. I would like to welcome the first panel which, of course, is, as you see, Mr. Murphy, Administrator, Risk Management Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nMr. Murphy, welcome and please begin.\n\nSTATEMENT OF WILLIAM J. \"BILL\" MURPHY, ADMINISTRATOR, RISK MANAGEMENT AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nMr. Murphy. Chairman Boswell, Congressman Graves, Members of the Subcommittee, as Administrator of the Risk Management Agency I am pleased to meet with you today to discuss progress, challenges, and successes of the Federal Crop Insurance Program, and in particular the recently negotiated Standard Reinsurance Agreement.\nSecretary Vilsack asked me to administer the Federal Crop Insurance Program in a manner that provides effective risk management services necessary for American farmers and ranchers, and one that offers such services to producers in all geographical areas, regardless of the size of their operation.\n\nFurther, the Secretary and I are aware that in today's economy it is important that the program be cost effective and give a fair value for the taxpayers' dollar.\n\nThe crop insurance program has grown in coverage and in value to producers over the last decade. In 1999, just 73 percent of insured acres for the ten major commodities had buy-up coverage. Today, that has risen to 92 percent. Not only are coverage levels increasing, but the type of coverage farmers are purchasing is shifting to the more complex, comprehensive revenue coverages.\n\nMany banks now require crop insurance coverage before making operating loans. Federal crop insurance has become an indispensable fact in the life of the American farmers.\n\nNegotiations for the 2011 SRA began in 2009, and were completed on July 13th, 2010, when the USDA announced that all 16 of the approved crop insurance companies had signed the new SRA. During the negotiation, RMA held many meetings with the companies to hear their concerns, their suggestions and to exchange ideas. Elements of many of the provisions in the final agreement were based on recommendations from the companies toward these negotiations.\n\nRMA and the companies negotiated in good faith and with respectful dialogue. The resulting agreement provides a reasonable rate of return to the companies for delivering the program, and will achieve $\\$ 6$ billion in savings over the next 10 years.\n\nThe new SRA will have no adverse impact on farmers' premium costs. In fact, certain farmers are likely to see a reduced insurance cost with the performance-based discount program resulting from the savings generated by this agreement.\n\nThe new SRA allows Administrative and Operating expense subsidies to fluctuate within a range, but removes the potential for the",

        "text": "type of excess windfalls experienced during the 2007 to 2009 price bubble.\n\nThe new SRA also for the first time provides the companies and their agents with financial protection from declines in the A\\&O subsidy should crop prices fall sharply.\n\nRMA also took steps in the new agreement to limit compensation to crop insurance agents. Companies have been unable to contain a disturbing escalation in agent commissions. In 2009, companies reported to RMA that the average agent commission in the Corn Belt States-Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Nebraskawas 18.6 percent, a premium, whereas the $\\mathrm{A} \\& O$ subsidy paid to the companies was only 17.1 percent.\n\nCompanies have been increasingly relying on expected underwriting gains which may or may not be realized to pay generous compensation arrangement to agents, while trying to meet their other program delivery costs. RMA is particularly sensitive to this issue because of the failure of American Growers due to similar circumstances in 2002, which cost taxpayers millions of dollars, disrupted program delivery, and still today is requiring government resources to close out this book of business.\n\nTo help ensure that does not reoccur, the new agreement limits company expenditures on base agent commissions to 80 percent of the A\\&O subsidy at the state level. This is the so-called \"soft cap.\"\n\nIn addition, if companies are in an underwriting profit, they may share this profit with agents, but total compensation will be limited to 100 percent of the annual subsidy at the state level. This is known as the \"hard cap.\"\n\nRMA believes that the amount companies can pay for their agents under the new SRA is reasonable and adequate to maintain producer servicing levels we see today. I, along with members of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Board of Directors, all the RMA staff across the country, recognize that the program is dependant on a reliable delivery system. The approved insurance companies who deliver this program with their network of agents and RMA rely heavily on each other to operate the program efficiently and effectively to meet the needs of Americans producers. At the same time, we are aware of our responsibility to be good stewards of taxpayer money. RMA is pleased to have a new and solid SRA in place.\n\nAgain, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important hearing. I look forward to responding to any questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Murphy follows:]\n\nPrepared Statement of William J. \"Bill\" Murphy, Administrator, Risk Management Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.\n\nChairman Boswell, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the Subcommittee, as Administrator of the Risk Management Agency (RMA), I am pleased to meet with you today to discuss the latest developments in RMA, the progress and challenges of the Federal Crop Insurance Program, and, in particular, to provide an update on the recently negotiated Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) and its benefits to the agricultural community and the American taxpayer.

        "text": "as regulators, we must also ensure the continued integrity and actuarial soundness of the Federal Crop Insurance Program.\n\nSecretary Vilsack asked me to administer the Federal Crop Insurance Program in a manner that provides effective risk management services necessary for American farmers and ranchers; and that offers such services and opportunities to participate in the program to farmers and ranchers in all geographical areas regardless of the size of their operation. The Secretary and I are aware that in today's economy it is important that the program be cost effective and give a fair value for the taxpayers' dollar.\n\nThe crop insurance program has grown in coverage and in value to producers over the last decade. In 1999, just 73 percent of insured acres for the ten staple crops had buy up coverage, compared to 92 percent in 2009 . Not only are coverage levels increasing, but the type of coverage farmers are purchasing is shifting to the more comprehensive revenue coverage. Many banks require crop insurance coverage in order to make operating loans to crop producers. Federal crop insurance has become a fact of life for many farmers-and one in which American farmers would find it difficult to continue providing America and the world with an abundant supply of food, fiber and fuel without the program.\n\nThis growth has been accomplished in an actuarially sound manner as required by Congress, and the program is working well. Over the last 2 decades, premiums (producer premiums added to premium subsidies) have been sufficient to cover the indemnities paid to producers plus a reasonable reserve, as directed by the Federal Crop Insurance Act.\n\nThe 2011 Standard Reinsurance Agreement\n\nThe Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill) allowed the renegotiation of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA), which is the agreement between USDA and the approved private insurance companies who deliver the program through a network of insurance agents. Negotiations began late in 2009, and on July 13, 2010, USDA announced that all of the approved crop insurance companies had signed the new SRA. At the beginning of the negotiations, Secretary Vilsack and I established six objectives for the new SRA that would build on the strengths of the program. The objectives were designed to align with RMA's primary mission to help producers manage the significant risks associated with agriculture. We maintained our focus on those objectives throughout the process and they have served us and America's farmers well. They are:\n\n(1) Maintain producer access to critical risk management tools;\n(2) Align the Administrative and Operating (A\\&O) subsidy paid to insurance companies closer to actual delivery costs;\n(3) Provide a reasonable rate of return to insurance companies;\n(4) Protect producers from higher costs while equalizing reinsurance performance across states to more effectively reach under-served producers, commodities, and areas;\n(5) Simplify provisions to make the SRA more understandable and transparent; and\n(6) Enhance program integrity.\n\nDuring the negotiations RMA held many meetings with the companies to hear their concerns and suggestions. Elements of several provisions in the final agreement were suggested by the companies during the negotiation. RMA and the companies negotiated in good faith and with respectful dialogue resulting in an agreement that provides a reasonable rate of return to the companies for delivering the program, and will achieve $\\$ 6$ billion in savings over the next 10 years. Two-thirds of the savings from the new SRA, $\\$ 4$ billion, will go toward paying down the Federal deficit. The $\\$ 4$ billion in budget savings USDA achieved is one of the first and most significant steps that a Federal agency has achieved in reducing mandatory spending from the long term Federal deficit. The President has laid out an aggressive plan for reducing the deficit and we are pleased to take a leadership role in that effort.\n\nThe remaining $1 / 3$ will support high priority risk management and conservation programs. This $\\$ 2$ billion invested in farm programs will be used, in part, to improve and expand several RMA risk management products. In fact, the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF) program has already been expanded as a result of the savings obtained through the SRA. Under the Rainfall Index (RI)-PRF plan of insurance, RMA will expand coverage for the 2011 crop year to specific counties in Colorado, and all counties in the states of California, Florida, Georgia, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas, bringing the total",

The Vegetation Index (VI)PRF will be expanded to the balance of counties in Idaho, Oregon, and South Dakota, and all counties in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah for 2011, bringing the state total where VI-PRF is available to nine.\n\nRMA has also received requests for further expansion of PRF in Nevada, Arkansas, Maryland, and Minnesota. RMA will take the expansion request for the 2012 crop year to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Board of Directors later this year for their consideration and potential approval.\n\nAs a result of these savings, RMA also plans to provide a performance based discount or refund, which will reduce the cost of crop insurance for certain producers. Additionally, USDA has used this opportunity to increase Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acreage to the maximum authorized level; investing in new and amended Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program initiatives; and investing in CRP monitoring.\n\nThe new SRA will have no adverse impact on farmers' premium costs. In fact, some farmers may even see reduced insurance costs with a performance-based discount or refund that result from the savings generated by this agreement.\n\nSRA Structure\n\nThe 2011 SRA was structured to reflect the realities of today's agriculture economy. Since government payments to crop insurance companies are tied to crop prices and price volatility, the unprecedented spike in commodity prices in recent years caused government payments to companies to more than double, from $\\$ 1.8$ billion in 2006 to $\\$ 3.8$ billion in 2009. The new SRA allows A\\&O payments to fluctuate within a range that removes the extremes. This will prevent windfall profits created by price spikes, like those we have seen in recent years, but will also ensure an adequate A\\&O subsidy is provided to companies. The new agreement provides a maximum A\\&O amount of $\\$ 1.3$ billion in 2011, and increases it yearly with inflation to $\\$ 1.37$ billion in 2015. This is almost 40 percent more than the $\\$ 935$ million the crop insurance companies received in A\\&O payments in 2006 (the last year before the price spikes) and 35 percent less than the $\\$ 2$ billion the industry received in 2008 (the height of the price spikes). Companies will be protected against extremely low crop prices by a minimum A\\&O reimbursement. This provision will ensure that the crop insurance companies receive at minimum about $\\$ 1$ billion in A\\&O payments, or slightly more than what it received in 2006 to deliver the program. This added protection will ensure that the companies have enough money to deliver the program, even if prices or price volatilities fall sharply.\n\nAgents' Compensation\n\nTo ensure the viability and integrity of the crop insurance delivery program, RMA took steps in the new agreement to limit compensation to crop insurance agents. Even in the face of cuts in A\\&O imposed by Congress, companies were unable to contain the escalation in agent commissions. A recent analysis showed that about 20 percent of A\\&O is needed to pay expenses related to loss adjustment, information technology, employees, and other operations (excluding agent commissions), yet many companies were paying agents far above the entire A\\&O subsidy amount in certain parts of the country. In 2009, average agent commission rates in the Corn Belt States (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Nebraska) were 18.6 percent of premium and the A\\&O paid to the companies was 17.1 percent. Therefore, these companies were relying on underwriting gains (which may or may not be realized) to pay for costs other than agent commissions. Companies were also moving A\\&O payments and bidding up agent commissions in the Corn Belt, which generally includes the most profitable states.\n\nThe new SRA includes a cap on agent commissions to ensure that companies have sufficient funds to pay the other operating expenses in years in which there may not be an underwriting gain. As the regulator for the Federal Crop Insurance Program, RMA saw a clear need to ensure that companies have sufficient funds to pay operating expenses (including agent commissions) without resorting to the reliance on uncertain underwriting gains.\n\nHistory has shown us that this step is necessary. In 2002, the largest crop insurance company in the program, American Growers Insurance Company, failed in large part because of high commissions paid to retain and acquire agents. American Growers' expenses exceeded the amount of A\\&O received so they were forced to rely on underwriting gains to remain solvent. Since 2002 was a moderately bad crop year, many crop insurance companies did not receive underwriting gains. American Growers actually ended the year with a small underwriting gain. However, its failure to receive an underwriting gain large enough to cover its commitments caused the company to collapse. This major failure caused widespread confusion and uncer-",

        "text": "tainty in the crop insurance program, and the remnants of this failure still are being felt by the program today.\n\nEight years later, in 2010, companies are still relying on large underwriting gains to operate the program and have been fortunate to have seen an unprecedented run of profitable underwriting years. The real possibility of even a modest loss year, such as 2002, however, creates a situation where several companies could be at risk for failure and thus jeopardize the entire delivery system.\n\nThe new agreement limits companies' expenditures on base agent commissions to 80 percent (soft cap) of the A\\&O subsidy at a state level. Companies may still use profit sharing, but total agent compensation will be limited to 100 percent (hard cap) of the A\\&O subsidy at a state level to ensure fair and equitable competition among all companies in all states.\n\nWhile the second draft proposal included only a \"soft cap\" on agent commissions equal to $80 \\%$ of the A\\&O subsidy, the final agreement added a \"hard cap\" on total agent compensation at $100 \\%$ of A\\&O subsidy on a state basis. This was done after considering concerns expressed by many companies and others that a soft cap alone would create equity issues between the states and provide an incentive for some companies to only write business in the most profitable states. Companies writing in these most profitable states would attract agents by claiming a potential for more consistent and higher rates of return and, consequently, greater availability of funding to provide for agent profit sharing. Providing a hard cap on profit sharing will limit the potential for companies to engage in such market-disrupting activities. Federal crop insurance is a nationwide program and the SRA should ensure that the companies and their agents have the incentives to provide service to all producers.\n\nEven with the hard cap, the expected amount of compensation potentially available to agents will be about $\\$ 1.3$ billion annually, given the expected A\\&O subsidy and average expected underwriting gain amounts provided by the agreement. On average, for the 2011 to 2015 life of the SRA, agent commissions will be limited to about $\\$ 1.1$ billion annually, while profit sharing will be limited annually to about $\\$ 270$ million. On average, the 100 percent cap allows around $1 / 3$ of total underwriting gains to be shared with agents, as determined by the companies.\n\nRMA analysis shows that the cap will primarily affect the Corn Belt states where companies generally have been paying average agent commissions above the total A\\&O subsidy. All other states have seen average commissions paid below the total A\\&O subsidy and are not likely to be affected.\n\nFor this year- 2010 -under the current SRA, agent commissions are already expected to decrease due to lower commodity prices and price volatilities not due to the new SRA. For example, Iowa agent commissions are expected to fall from about $\\$ 140$ million in 2009 to about $\\$ 110$ million in 2010 , under the current SRA. The new SRA hard cap will be placed at about $\\$ 105$ million in 2011 . Therefore, the provisions of the new SRA will result in an average 5.7 percent decline from 2010 in dollar terms in Iowa.\n\nHowever, this is $72 \\%$ greater than the dollars Iowa agents received in 2006, even though the number of policies serviced is virtually unchanged. In effect, expected 2011 agent compensation reflects the equivalent of compounded annual income increases of $12 \\%$ over this 5 year period, an impressive record that can be matched by very few others in the recent, sluggish economy. In an environment where the number of Iowa policies is stagnant, therefore, RMA believes compensation to agents through the new SRA is more than reasonable for 2011 and, with the builtin inflation adjustment factor, the compensation cap is guaranteed to increase with expected inflation.\n\nRisk Sharing\n\nThe previous agreement's risk sharing terms were structured in such a way that some states in the Corn Belt experienced much greater profitability for companies and agents than in other states. Analysis by Milliman, Inc. also indicates that the industry as a whole has been making far above a reasonable rate of return. This analysis shows that over the last 21 years a reasonable rate of return for the companies averaged 12.7 percent, while the companies actually received an average rate of return of 17.0 percent. The new agreement provides an expected return to companies of about 14.5 percent, almost two percentage points above the reasonable rate of return.\n\nThe new SRA rebalances the risk sharing terms to better equalize expected returns throughout the different states, including terms that are more profitable for states outside the Corn Belt. The new SRA also maintains the Assigned Risk Fund, which provides companies with stop loss protection at a state level.",

        "text": "The new agreement sets the Net Book Quota Share at 6.5 percent, with 1.5 percentage points of underwriting gain to be distributed to those companies that sell and service policyholders in 17 underserved or less-served states (Group 3 states). This provides an additional financial incentive for companies to continue doing business in these underserved or less-served states.\nTogether, the changes we have made in the new SRA, through negotiations with the private companies, will create a more sustainable Federal Crop Insurance Program, and the expansion of key risk management and conservation programs will improve the safety net for America's farmers and ranchers. The new SRA represents a fair deal for farmers and the government, the companies, the agents, and the taxpayers.\n\nStatus of the Federal Crop Insurance Program\n\nThe Federal Crop Insurance Program is helping the men and women who produce America's agricultural products to manage risk in an inherently risky business. For crop year 2009 with 1.2 million policies on 265 million acres, the program provided coverage for $\\$ 79.6$ billion in crop value. Of the $\\$ 8.9$ billion in total premium, USDA subsidized $\\$ 5.4$ billion for farmers, and paid out over $\\$ 5$ billion in claims for lost or damaged crops. In addition, RMA awarded $\\$ 8.6$ million in Partnership Agreements to assist small and underserved producers across the country.\n\nProducers generally have a choice of crop or livestock policies, with coverage they can tailor to best fit their risk management needs. In many cases, producers can buy insurance coverage for a yield loss, or revenue protection to provide coverage for a decline in yield or price. Today, most producers \"buy up\" to higher levels of coverage ranging up to 85 percent (smallest deductible), although a low level of catastrophic coverage (CAT) is still available for a nominal fee with the premium fully subsidized. Indemnity payments are usually made within 30 days after the producer signs the claim form.\n\nThe crop insurance program has seen sustained growth as demonstrated by the increasing proportion of acres insured at buy up levels over the last decade (see $A t$ tachment 3). In 2009, 92 percent of insured acres for the ten staple crops had buyup coverage, compared to just 73 percent in 1999. Not only are buy up levels increasing, but the type of coverage being purchased is shifting to the more comprehensive revenue coverage (see Attachment 4). In 2009, revenue coverage accounted for 57 percent of the insured acres, compared to just 27 percent in 1999. In addition, the average coverage level (percent of the total crop covered) for buy up insurance has increased. In 2009, the average coverage level rose to a recordhigh of 73 percent. In 1999, the average was 67 percent.\n\nProgram Integrity\n\nIn conjunction with the improved quality control requirements in the new SRA, RMA Compliance has revised its work plans to reflect a more balanced approach between quality assurance and investigating program abuses. In a time of declining resources and increased responsibilities, effective internal controls provide a significant cost-benefit compared to identifying and prosecuting program abuse alone. RMA is currently reviewing company operations and internal controls to determine the success of their efforts to address crop insurance program vulnerability concerns.\n\nRMA continues to make significant progress in preempting fraud, waste and abuse through the expanded use of data mining. We have preempted millions of dollars' worth of projected payments, and RMA continues to use data mining to identify anomalous producer, adjuster, and agent program results. With the assistance of the Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices, RMA and companies conduct growing season spot checks to ensure that claims for losses are legitimate. These spot checks based on data mining have resulted in a significant reduction in anomalous claims for those situations.\n\nWe are improving the timing and quality of our sanctions requests as well. RMA continues to work with USDA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) to limit the number of cases declined due to insufficient evidence. This improvement is attributable to Compliance personnel becoming more proficient at identifying evidence and establishing cases that will pass legal sufficiency requirements. The Administrative Sanctions regulations that were identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as requiring publication were published and were effective on January 20, 2009. Although RMA was using the statutory authority to impose sanctions before the regulations were published, RMA agreed with GAO that the publication should be prioritized to ensure that program participants and other interested parties were given appropriate constructive notice of the rules.",

        "text": "RMA is continually seeking new and more effective ways to work with the other regulatory bodies and government agencies as well as insurance companies, agents and producers to ensure the integrity of the Federal Crop Insurance Program. RMA compliance reviews continue to reveal that there are only a small number of producers who have been involved in fraud or illicit activity. While no level of criminal or abusive behavior is acceptable, RMA continues to believe the number of persons involved in criminal activity is relatively small.\n\nWhile RMA, FSA and the insurance providers have preempted tens of millions of dollars of improper payments through quality controls, data mining, and other measures, RMA is constantly identifying ways to balance competing needs to make our products less susceptible to fraud while seeking to provide responsive, useful risk protection to farmers. We still have work to do and improvements to make, but we are making good progress in our fight against program waste, fraud and abuse.\nIn the recent past, there have been some concerns expressed about unresolved Office of Inspector General (OIG) Audit recommendations. In particular, RMA was cited as having 70 OIG audit recommendations pending for a year or more after agencies agreed to implement them. However, according to RMA's records, there are only 14 audit recommendations that now meet this criterion. RMA believes that both OIG and GAO audits have resulted in program improvements over the years and continues to commit significant resources to resolving and implementing audit recommendations that can reasonably be expected to achieve greater efficiency or effectiveness for the program and the taxpayer.\n\nOrganics\n\nIn January 2010, RMA submitted a report to Congress entitled Organic Crops and the Federal Crop Insurance Program, as required by the 2008 Farm Bill. The report included information on the numbers and varieties of organic crops insured; the status of the development of new insurance approaches to organic crops and the progress of implementing organic initiatives required by the 2008 Farm Bill. The 2008 Farm Bill also required that RMA contract for research into whether or not sufficient data exists upon which RMA could determine a price election for organic crops; if such data does exist to pursue further development of a pricing methodology using that data; and that RMA contract for research into underwriting, risk and loss experience of organic crops as compared with the same crops produced in the same counties during the same crop years using nonorganic methods. Three studies that resulted from this research, Organic Crops: Report on Research of Additional Price Elections; Organic Crops: Final Development of Additional Price Elections and Organic Crops: Revised Written Rating Report are expected to be released shortly.\n\nReview of Rating Methodology\n\nRMA contracted with Sumaria Systems Inc. for a thorough actuarial review of the methodology and procedures used to determine the Actual Production History (yield) target rates and the rating process for the new Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (often referred to as COMBO policy) under the Federal Crop Insurance Program. The draft report was received in November 2009 and was made available for public comment. A final version of the review is now available at http:/ /www.rma.usda.gov/pubs / 2009/comprehensivereview.pdf on the RMA website.\n\nThe review found that RMA's general premium rating methodology (based on historical losses) is appropriate and should continue to be used. However, the study identified several areas for potential improvement, the most significant of which is to determine if all historical losses should be given the same weight in determining premium rates. In addition, key aspects of today's crop insurance program along with crop production technology would also be considered and evaluated for potential effects on past experience. This would provide a basis for evaluating the degree to which past catastrophic events may affect the historical loss data used in establishing current premium rates, and as appropriate, allow for adjustments to those rates. This could potentially result in lower premium rates in several parts of the country, especially the Corn Belt. RMA is currently in the process of soliciting bids for this review of its historical loss data so that work can commence later this year. In the near term, premium rates for the most popular revenue products, Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC) and Revenue Assurance (RA), are expected to be generally lower for the 2010 crop year as a result of decreasing price volatilities.\n\nNew Common Crop Insurance Policy (COMBO Policy)\n\nThe new Common Crop Insurance Policy, frequently referred to as the COMBO policy, is an initiative by RMA to combine and simplify the crop insurance program. RMA has combined CRC, RA, Income Protection (IP), and Indexed Income Protection (IIP) into a single uniform policy. RMA kept and combined the principle fea-",

        "text": "tures of the five plans that producers bought most often and developed a single rating and pricing component so all insurance coverage is consistent in insurance protection and cost to producers. The new Basic Provisions are effective for the 2011 crop year for crops with a contract change date of April 30, 2010 or later (effective for most 2011 crops) and for the 2012 crop year for crops with a 2011 crop year contract change date prior to April 30, 2010.\n\nComprehensive Information Management System\n\nThe Comprehensive Information Management System, referred to as CIMS, is designed to provide approved users timely access to 2006 thru 2010 RMA and Farm Service Agency (FSA) producer information and data. The system has improved operations between RMA and FSA and has the potential to continue improving information transfer. At this time, FSA employees have access to CIMS, which has led to a $56 \\%$ reduction in entity differences for producers participating in the programs of the two agencies, including support for the SURE program. Crop insurance companies have made over 18 million CIMS inquiries or requests for information, reducing resources and costs to obtain electronically data similar to the hard copy information that normally resides at the FSA County office. Companies are also incorporating the use of Common Land Unit reporting into their systems to enhance reconciliation efforts for acreage reporting and other applications for administering programs for prevented planting and cause of loss verification. RMA also is actively participating in the USDA Acreage/Crop Reporting Streamlining initiative to establish common USDA producer commodity reporting standards to facilitate greater use of CIMS and Agency sharing and reconciliation of data, along with potential incorporation of data obtained through the use of precision-ag technology.\n\nInformation Technology Modernization\n\nRMA's Information Technology Modernization (ITM) program is a multi-year, phased-implementation reengineering initiative to support COMBO and new insurance programs and products, increase actuarial capabilities, and provide efficient policy and financial processing for producers and insurance companies. The first phase, successfully operational in April 2010, focused on actuarial processes, policy processing, premium calculations, and other functions needed to administer various 2011 crop year insurance offers, and implement the new COMBO policy. The next phases of the ITM program, corporate business reporting and financial accounting, are in development with final completion scheduled for the end of 2011.\n\nI, along with members of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Board of Directors, all the RMA staff across the country, recognize that the program is dependent on a reliable delivery system. The approved insurance companies, who deliver this program with their network of agents, and RMA, are mutually dependent on each other to operate the program efficiently and effectively to meet the needs of producers. We are very aware of our responsibility to be good stewards of taxpayer money. By creating a new standard reinsurance agreement that maintains excellent service to farmers and ranchers, provides incentives for companies to operate in underserved and less served areas, provides a reasonable return for the companies and removes windfall government payments that were an unintended consequence of the past SRA structure, RMA is pleased to have met the goals set at the beginning of this negotiation. Again, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important hearing. I look forward to responding to your questions.",
