        "text": "To the Faculty, Committee Members and others associated with the Graduate School:\n\nMay 23, 1951\nMost widely read GS lectures\nare probably those given by Rudolf Flesch in 1943-45 to his classes in \"Readable Writing.\" These were published in his book, THE ART OF PLAIN TALK, shortly after Dr. Flesch moved to New York from Washington, where he had served as chief bulletin editor for the OFA. More than 170 thousand copies have been sold of this and two of his other books -- THE WAY TO WRITE and the ART OF READABLE WRITING.\n\nLast month Dr. Flesch came back to GS as guest lecturer to the class in \"Readable Writing\" now taught by his former students, Amy G. Cowing and Harry Mileham (Ext.). His subject was a new formula described in his most recently published book, HOW TO TEST READABILITY. You can get this from Harpers for $\\$ 1$.\n\nIn this country only 13 years, Dr. Flesch has made a tremendous impact on our writing. He turned to the study of library science when he could find no posts in this country for which his legal training in Austria fitted him. The formula for measuring reading difficulties was written while Dr. Flesch was a graduate student at Columbia. He thought it would be useful to librarians in estimating levels of reading interest and ability. It has had a much wider application.\n\nFor example, the annual report of the Associated Press in April pointed to striking improvements in newspaper copy prepared by AP reporters. Dr. Flesch gets the credit. Incidentally you can get a copy of his recommendations by sending ten cents to Victor Hackler, general executive of the AP, at 50 Rockefeller Plaza, New York 20, N. Y.\n\nDr. Flesch has another book in press, THE ART OF PLAIN THINKING, scheduled for publication in October. He has continued his teaching too and is now on the staff of New York University.\n\nPointing with pride\nto 4 new 1951-1952 rotating courses in advanced pharmacology taught by scientists from the Food and Drug Administration, Henry Stevens (AIC) of the Department of Physical Sciences says this work is not available elsewhere. The courses cover: (1) pharmacology of insecticides; (2) alkaloids, glucosides, and toxins of biological importance; (3) specialized analytical techniques; and (4) enzymatic bases of the pharmacological action of drugs. Arnold J. Lehman, Geoffrey Woodard, and Carter D. Johnson are the instructors.",

        "text": "for GS faculty members -- an increase from $\\$ 5$ a credit hour to $\\$ 6$-- goes into effect during the fall term. The change -- first proposed by the Committee on Long Range Plans -- has been in the works since 1948. It was recommended by the GS Council in June 1950 and adopted by the General Administration Board in July, but action was delayed because the 1950 1951 catalog had already gone to press. We feared another delay this spring when the OPS wage and price stabilization policies were announced. Fortunately, a supplementary regulation excepted schools and colleges from the control of tuition rates, fees, and other service charges. This will permit an increase in tuition fees to finance the increased faculty pay.\n\nNew chairmen of departmental committees\n\nAppointed May lare: Henry A. Donovan (BAIC), Office Techniques and Operations and Elsa O. Keiles (BHNHE), Physical Sciences. New vice-chairmen are James E. Halligan (FHA), Office Techniques and Operations; Arnold J. Lehman (FDA), Physical Sciences; and Harry C. Trelogan (ARA), Social Sciences. New names on the roster of Committee members are: Raymund L. Zwemer (LOC), Biological Sciences; Earl E. Houseman (BAE), Mathematics a√± Statistics; Leslie W. Ball (Navy), Physical Sciences; Bushrod W. Allin (BAE) and James E. Thigpen (PMA), Social Sciences.\n\n\"This country cannot afford\nto plan the mobilization of its manpower on the theory that sufficed for World War II: that manpower can be drawn from any and all peacetime pursuits to win a short war. If we must face the stark prospect of indefinite mobilization, then a regard for the individual rights of the generation coming of age as well as the civilization of the Nineteen Seventies demands that we budget our manpower for all scientific, professional, and cultural pursuits as well as for military strength and defense production.\" John J. Corson (Public Administration) NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, May 13, 1951.\n\nCollege students across the country\nare showing an interest in the Research Internship program. We notice in the most recent report of applicants that nominations have increased from 13 in 1949 to 69 for 1951-52. Among these are 33 nominations for posts as chemists, 17 for agricultural economists, 4 for agricultural education specialists with OFAR, 2 nutrition specialists, l entomologist, lengineer, $l$ bacteriologist, and 1 physicist. Eight of the applicants are women. Appointments in most cases won't be confirmed until after July 1 when agencies have the final word on appropriations.\n\nCredit the increased interest in the program to the work done by R. Y. Winters (ARA) and his Committee, to staffers in the Division of Employment (OP) and to excellent cooperation by graduate deans and others in Land-Grant colleges.",

        "text": "come from an article by D. M. Hall, University of Illinois, in the March EXTENSION NEWS:\n1. Bring into the planning phases all persons who are expected to to be integrated into the program.\n2. Set out to discover the potential resources of each member of the group. Maximum production is achieved only when we learn to respond to each other in terms of competencies rather than personal likes and dislikes.\n3. Make each new idea become the group's property. Then judge ideas rather than personalities.\n4. Consider each committee member a \"change agent\" with responsibilities for helping the group change its behavior. Remember, no one .- not even the chairman -- can become any better than he is unless he changes.\n- 5. Appoint an analyzer to record and report at frequent intervals what is going on. He evaluates processes rather than motions made. Thus each member becomes more conscious of the group's direction -- toward integration or disintegration.\n6. Establish an atmosphere that is conducive to change; cherish differences; maintain an atmosphere freed of fears.\n7. Become informed about, and skillful in playing, the roles that build up and suppress those roles that destroy.\n\nThe valuable services\nof USDA's library could be vastly improved, says a committee from the Association of Colleges and Reference Libraries, if funds were available for an adequate acquisition program.\n\nThe committee also recommends extending the cooperative library service, such as that set up at the University of Nebraska, to other areas and suggests that the USDA library establish a training program for agricultural libraries. The recommendations are carried in an 18 -page multilithed report on the policies and programs of the USDA library. The report was prepared by the Agricultural Libraries section of the Association.\n\nThe Fund for Adult Education\nset up in April by the Ford Foundation has recently granted $\\$ 160,000$ to the committee on liberal education of the Association of Evening Colleges. The money is to be used for a 2 -year study of liberal education for adults. The Association represents 76 evening colleges throughout the United States.",
