NELSON STATE ADVISORY BOARD MEETING\n\n\nTHE TAYLOR GRAZING ACT\n\nThere are two items which I wish to discuss with you in particular, for I believe a clear understanding is essential. One is the \"Taylor Grazing Act\" and the other is the phrase \"National Land Reserve\".\n\nAlthough the Taylor Grazing Act was enacted twenty-eight years ago, there is still a lack of understanding of its provisions. Actually, it is a conservation act even though some people have considered it as a law giving special privileges to range livestock operators and favoring their industry.\n\nThe act is a basic piece of legislation in that it provides for more than just the grazing use of the public land. The preamble of the act states, \"To stop injury to the public grazing lands by preventing overgrazing and soil deterioration, to provide for their orderly use, improvement, and development, to stabilize the livestock industry upon the public range, and for other purposes.\"\n\nYou will note that its first objective is to bring the grazing lands under management and control and to improve and rehabilitate the range. It then speaks of stabilizing the livestock industry. The two, however, go hand in hand for the industry cannot be stabilized unless the ranges are in such condition that they may provide assurance of feed over a period of favorable and unfavorable years.\n\nSection 1 of the act authorizes the establishment of grazing districts from the vacant, unappropriated and unreserved public domain lands. Two districts have been established in California having a combined acreage of about 4 million acres of public land. Their headquarters are at Bakersfield and Susanville. This section also assures right of access to these lands by the public.\n\nSection 2 directs the Secretary of the Interior to make rules and regulations providing for the protection, administration, regulation and improvement of the grazing districts.\n\nSection 3 authorizes the Secretary to issue or cause to be issued permits to graze livestock on the grazing districts, upon the payment of reasonable fees which will consist of a fee for the use of the range and a range improvement fee which, when appropriated by Congress, shall be available until expended solely for the construction, purchase, or maintenance of range improvements.\n\nIt also sets rules as to granting preferences to use the public range.",

        "text": "Section 4 provides for granting of permits to place range improvements on the public range and Section 5 deals with free use of forage and other materials. Section 6 assures ingress and egress over the public lands for proper and lawful purposes, the granting of rights-of-way and prospecting, locating, developing, mining, entering, leasing, or patenting mineral resources under applicable laws.\n\nSection 7 is a particularly important feature of the act. Two executive orders (Nov. 26, 1934 and Feb. 5, 1935) placed the heretofore vacant, unappropriated and unreserved public domain in a reserved status. These executive orders are in effect today. This section authorizes the Secretary in his discretion, to examine and classify lands withdrawn or reserved by these executive orders. There are approximately 16 million acres of such land in California which are not subject to disposition, settlement, or occupation until they have been classified and opened to entry. However, this section specifically provides that locations and entries under the mining laws may be made upon such withdrawn and reserved areas without regard to classification and without restrictions or limitations by any provision of the act.\n\nSection 8 provides for exchanges of lands and acceptance of lands as a gift. In Section 9 provision is made for cooperation with associations of stockmen and state agencies.\n\nSections 10 and 11 deal with the disposition of moneys received under authority of the act. Sections 12 and 13 authorize coordination and jurisdiction between the National forests and National land reserve, Section 14 authorizes the sale of isolated tracts of lands and rough and mountainous areas.\n\nIn California Section 15 is important for there are about 12 million acres of National land reserve not included in grazing districts. This section authorizes leasing to grazing users.\n\nSection 16 pertains to law enforcement on lands covered by the act, by the respective states. Section 17 has been superseded.\n\nSection 18 establishes by law, district advisory boards for the purpose of providing information, advice and recommendations. It sets up general rules as to membership and function.\n\nThis is just a brief resume' of the Act of June 28, 1934, commonly referred to as the Taylor Grazing Act. You have a copy of it in your folder and also a copy of the regulation which provides our field people and range users with specific rules relative to the administration of grazing use on the National land reserve.\n\nThe act is a most important piece of legislation for it recognized a need for the control of use of the lands now referred to as the National land reserve. It directed that these lands be brought under management.",

        "text": "Through the executive orders placing the lands in a reserved status, and the classification feature of the act, it authorized the Secretary of the Interior to consider the public interest with regards to land use and 1 and tenure.\n\nLater in the day our Division Chiefs will discuss their particular activities with you. I believe you may then more fully understand the broad influence of this act.\n\nTHE NATIONAL LAND RESERVE\n\nWhen our nation was founded, seven of the original thirteen states ceded their claims to some 233 million acres in what was then known as the Northwest Territory (Ohio - Indiana, etc.). These lands became the first \"public domain.\" It was the intention of the new nation that these public domain lands would pass from federal to private ownership. As new land acquisitions were made such as the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican Cession, etc., these lands also became a part of the public domain. During our history as a nation over one billion one million acres of land have been transferred to individual citizens, businesses and non-Federal governmental organizations under Federal legal authority generally referred to as the \"land laws\". Various Federal departments, agencies or commissions hold title to about 771 million acres or about 34 percent of the gross area of the United States. Most of these lands are in fact \"public domain\".\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management administers and manages approximately 477 million acres of \"public domain\" lands. Some 300 million acres are in Alaska and most of the remaining 177 million acres are in the states west of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. These lands are often referred to as the \"public domain\", \"Federal lands\" and \"Taylor grazing lands\". Although these terms may be factual, they are not necessarily descriptive of the lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management National forests, National parks, military reservations, too are largely \"public domain\".\n\nAbout 20 months ago the President in his message on natural resources to the Congress, referred to the lands under the administration and management of BLM as a \"vital land reserve\". From this statement was coined the phrase \"The National land reserve\" which we have been using.\n\nThe word \"reserve\" I know is objectionable to some people and I can understand why. In referring to the dictionary I find several meanings. The first two definitions in the dictionary I used were these:\n1. To set aside or withhold for the present, as for future use or disposal.\n2. To keep as ones own; retain possession or control of, as by legal or formal stipulation; as to reserve all rights in a book.",

        "text": "I believe the first definition is the connotation to be applied to the word \"reserve\" in the phrase \"National land reserve\".\n\nCongress in enacting the many laws pertaining to the \"public domain\"has established policy concerning these lands.\n\nAlthough I have previously touched briefly on Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act, I will cite it in its entirety for I believe it may assure that although we may be talking about reserved land, they are not locked up in perpetuity but are subject to certain stipulations and to many other land and mineral laws enacted by the Congress of the United States.\n\"Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized in his discretion, to examine and classify any lands withdrawn or reserved by Executive order of November 26, 1934 (numbered 6910), and amendments thereto, and Executive order of February 5, 1935 (numbered 6964), or within a grazing district, which are more valuable or suitable for the production of agricultural crops than for the production of native grasses and forage plants, or more valuable or suitable for any other use than for the use provided for under this Act, or proper for acquisition in satisfaction of any outstanding lieu, exchange or script rights or land grant, and to open such lands to entry, selection, or location for disposal in accordance with such classification under applicable public-1 and laws, except that homestead entries shall not be allowed for tracts exceeding three hundred and twenty acres in area. Such lands shall not be subject to disposition, settlement, or occupation until after the same have been classified and opened to entry: PROVIDED, That locations and entries under the mining laws, including the Act of February 25, 1920, as amended, may be made upon such withdrawn and reserved areas without regard to classification and without restrictions or limitation by any provision of this Act. Where such lands are located within grazing districts reasonable notice shall be given by the Secretary of the Interior to any grazing permittee of such lands. The applicant, after his entry, selection, or location is allowed, shall be entitled to the possession and use of such lands: PROVIDED, That upon the application of any applicant qualified to make entry, selection, or location, under the public-1and laws, filed in the land office of the proper district, the Secretary of the Interior shall cause any tract to be classified, and such application if allowed by the Secretary of the Interior, shall entitle the applicant to a preference right to enter, select, or locate such lands if opened to entry as herein provided. (43 U.S.C., sec. 315f)",

        "text": "In addition to the Taylor Grazing Act there are two others which provide for classification of lands. They are: The Recreation and Public Purposes Act and the Small Tract Act.\n\nLet us look for a moment at the Land Status Map of California. You will note large areas of BLM responsibility in the southeastern part of the state, another large area in the northeastern counties. A more scattered pattern exists on the edges of the great central valley, in the northwestern counties and Siskiyou County.\n\nThese lands are, and are becoming even more so, very important to the many special interest groups within the state. Some of the interests are represented here and some are not. These lands represent about 16 percent of the land surface of the state and therefore have a marked effect upon the social and economic future of the state. They are in fact a reservoir of land to serve the people of California, whether through transfer to private ownership or for the management of their resources.\n\nWe have needed a term which is descriptive of the lands for which we are responsible. If someone can coin one better than \"National land reserve\" I am sure that the Director of the Bureau and the Secretary would be glad to have their suggestion.",
