Numerous comments have been sent to me and my staff, certain legal counsels and certain state officials. In these comments have been numerous legitimate questions and concerns which I will address in this memorandum. There have also been allegations about business practices that are frankly wildly inaccurate and just plain wrong. I will address these as well.\n\nThere has been reference made by many to the State of Vermont Regional Center and the role it plays in Vermont EB-5 programs. I'd like to state what their role is.\nThe State of Vermont does indeed play an important role. They review and approve the business plan of each project before we start; paying close attention to the job creation matrix that is so vital in the removal of conditions stage of an investor's involvement. The state routinely visits the resort during construction and operation to review and monitor the implementation of the business plan and progress of the construction against the project schedule. We submit project data to the state quarterly to validate the degree to which construction and job creation are indeed keeping pace within our plans. Validating job creation is the most important thing to most every investor. Having the conditional green card made permanent is typically the thing every invcstor considers most important, and reaching job creation requirements is vital to this process. Jay Peak with the State of Vermont's help has been $100 \\%$ successful in job creation success and 829 authorizations for all Jay Peak EB-5 projects where I-829 removal of conditions are due.\nThe State of Vermont does not conduct financial statement audits on our EB-5 projects and frankly that is an expense we don't request the partners pay for. At Jay Peak we have three CPA's on our staff directly involved with the EB5 financial reporting and they adhere to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles at all times. Their licenses are at risk if they don't respect appropriate accounting principles.\n\nI would like to address some other items.\nThe economies of the project have largely been positive. The hotel was completed, albeit a bit late due to weather and permit delays, but opened Dccember 2009 and has been well received since. Income from operations has increased each year and dividends have been about $2 \\%$ each of the past three ycars. Jay Peak pays for all variable expenses of operating the hotel (payroll of staff, housekeeping, sales and marketing, front desk matcrials, reservation service fees) through a management agreement which was agreed to by every investor and provides the management company $50 \\%$ of revenue regardless of whether Jay Peak's costs are covered or not. The Limited Partnership is responsible for fixed expenses (insurance, utilitics, taxes, repairs \\& maintenance). The proceeds available after these types of costs are distributed to the Limited Partners. You have received income statements showing the calculation of the distributions. This is done at minimum",

        "text": "quarterly. The last statement reported as of August 31, 2013 is attached and included each month of operation for reference.\n\nIn 2013 several partners expressed to me their desire to have an exit strategy initiated that would begin to pay back the investment and that would assure them that as much of their investment as the market would support would ultimately be repaid. A hard truth is that since 2008-2009's banking collapse and the subsequent real estate collapse, the second home real estate market in New England, and really throughout the United States, fell to unprecedented lows and has not yet recovered.\n\nThis reality has limited our options for an exit plan. Real estate sales are as of today not existent to the level required to exit all partners anywhere near their original investment. At some point, second home markets may rebound, but all experts we consulted with don't see a return to pre- 2008 levels for some time, but we are monitoring this constantly.\n\nWhat I did hear from investors was that they would like me to find an exit strategy that would (1) start paying them back immediately, (2) that would ultimately guarantee as close to $100 \\%$ return of the original investment as possible, and (3) that would allow for acceleration of the repayments to investors as the market recovers. As General Partner for the limited partners, I turned to my company, Jay Peak, and inquired whether there was a way that Jay Peak could step up to the plate for the investors and get them what they were asking for.\nA program was structured to have the investors paid $\\$ 307,017(17,500,000 / 57$ suites $=307,017$ ) for each of the 57 hotel suites over time ( $\\$ 500,000$ to each investor), plus a small amount of interest while they waited for repayments as the market recovered. In order for Jay Peak to be interested in buying out all of the investors at this price point at this time in the marketplace, there needed to be a cash flow program with a balloon to guarantee the final payment. However, as I have stated we would revisit the marketplace annually in attempts to accelerate the buyout. This $\\$ \\mathbf{3 0 7 , 0 1 7}$ per unit sale price would not be available to investors in this marketplace under any other circumstances. If you feel that this transaction is one-sided or generous to Jay Peak, you should understand that Jay Peak has agreed to pay over $\\$ 18,000,000$ to the limited partners over the next 5 years for an asset that will pay Jay Peak approximately $\\$ 2.5$ Million over that same 5 year period. (This was determined by taking the $2-3 \\%$ return that Jay Peak will now receive annually instead of the investors.)\nAny other buyer would have looked at this in a much more objective, less attractive way. This represents more than 50 years for return of investment to the buyer and with no management rights.\nNo one could have predicted the financial trauma of 2008-2009. And although I'm sure that you are quite happy to be receiving $100 \\%$ of your investment back, without any sales commissions being paid, in a marketplace that is down as much as $50 \\%$, I know this schedule is not what you might have hoped for but I have done the best I could in these trying market conditions. Each partner expects, a return of their investment, as swiftly as possible and wants the repayment plan for the same to be guaranteed. As stated, market conditions and operating business levels just don't allow Jay Peak to pay $100 \\%$ of the $\\$ 500,000$ right away. We have evaluated the requests from several of you that a 9 year redemption plan is longer than desired and too great a burden! As such I have asked that Jay Peak's CFO revisit the financials and the offer, and demanded that the CFO make every attempt to find a way to shorten the payoff to you while still maintaining Jay Peak's financial ability to make the offer. Although I am advised that anything in excess of the original financial plan is not feasible to Jay Peak, I have convinced them to accelerate the balloon to occur at the end of 5 years rather than 9. Jay Peak has agreed to offer an amended payment plan to each investor as follows:\n\n2014-\\$21,500* 2015-\\$21,500 2016-\\$21,500",

        "text": "Furthermore, as stated before I will re-evaluate this plan at the end of each fiscal year to determine if the payment can be further accelerated. If operational outcomes allow or Real Estate markets improve I will enhance the plan. But at present, given market conditions, this is the best Jay Peak can do at this time.\nIn the interim you are free to use the promissory note with your private lenders to maximize the liquidity you can gain between now and 2018 with a private institution of your choosing.\nThe Promissory note has been rewritten to reflect this enhanced repayment schedule. It will also omit any reference to waiving legal rights. This revised note is attached.\nJay Peak has instructed me that any further enhancement or requests for amendment of this offer would not be financially sustainable by them and upon such would move to retract the offer and the redemption agreement. I do not believe this will be in the best interests of the investors as it may require them to wait years to achieve a marketplace where the units will be sold with expense commissions and without management rights. The offer by Jay Peak at this time is very generous in this marketplace and is why $I$ moved in this direction on your behalf.\n\nWhat authority did I have as General Partner to dissolve this limited partnership and proceed as we did?\nAttached are two portions of the offering documents which everyone has had from the beginning of this project. These documents form the basis of all operational activities and the guidelines for going forward activities. After all I-829's were approved, which has been accomplished, clear authority rests with the GP to sell the hotel if it allows for the structured setup to repay the limited partners. My objective was and is, to guarantee a repayment of the full investment of $\\$ 500,000$.\n\nI wish to sincerely apologize for the delay in getting you the documents on the Hotel transaction last August. The delay, however unintentional, was my fault and I apologize for it. We were simply very busy with a host of things and I should have been in contact with you at the time of the transition and not $4+$ months later. Even though your approval was not required, common courtesy dictated that communication take place at the time of the transition. This has created mistrust and I regret this very much.\n\nThere have also been some general references to Jay Peak and me personally as to our business conduct. Some of the verbiage used in recent communication about financial conduct, which I won't dignify by repeating, are ridiculous and without a single bit of justification.\n\nHere are some important facts.\nAll investors funds were properly invested in the Tram Haus Lodge $100 \\%$ of all $\\$ 17.5$ Million US Dollars. Please note your 829 filing for a detailed expenditure summary.\n\nA beautiful 57 suite Hotel was constructed and the size and scope of the property exceeds the offering document requirements. Any excess cost for the enhanced quality and scope of the Hotel was paid $100 \\%$ by Jay Peak. Many partners have been here to see the property and know it to be everything and more than was promised.\n\nWe produce very honest and adequate quarterly reports for each partner throughout all of our projects. It is a very big job with 564 limited partners in 6 projects, but our accounting team does a thorough and exceptional job. We are in the process of expanding the EB-5 accounting team.\n\nTo Summarize, all investors received green cards, had conditions removed, many are now citizens, have begun receiving principle payback and the full payback is guaranteed by promissory notes of Jay Peak Resort with assets far in excess of the value of these notes. This is",

Because this is not available we could wait until market conditions better allow, or begin paying back the partners now.\nI chose at the behest of many of you to begin repayment. It was not required that I do anything, but to delay is just pushing repayment off to a future time. Perhaps the easy thing to do, but that does not address the needs many of you advocated for, a guaranteed repayment plan starting in 2013.\n\nI hope these comments and clarifications are helpful. I look forward to seeing this buyback plan completed successfully for all. If you have any questions I will do my best to answer them.\n\n\nGentral Partrer\nJay Peak Phase I L.P.",
