If $\\sigma(A)=\\alpha$, then\n\n$$\nA(n)\\geq\\alpha n\n$$\n\nfor all $n=1,2,3,\\ldots.$ If $1\\notin A$, then $A(1)=0$ and so $\\sigma(A)=0$.\n\nIf A contains every positive integer, then $A(n)=n$ for all $n\\geq1$ and so $\\sigma(A)=1$. If $m\\not\\in A$ for some $m\\geq1$, then $A(m)\\leq m-1$ and\n\n$$\n\\sigma(A)\\leq{\\frac{A(m)}{m}}\\leq1-{\\frac{1}{m}}<1.\n$$\n\nThus, $\\sigma(A)=1$ if and only if $A$ contains every positive integer.\n\nIf $A$ and $B$ are sets of integers, the sumset $A+B$ is the set consisting of all integers of the form $a+b$, where $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$. If $A_{1},\\ldots,A_{h}$ are $h$ sets of integers, then\n\n$$\nA_{1}+A_{2}+\\cdots+A_{h}\n$$\n\ndenotes the set of all integers of the form $a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{h}$, where $a_{i}\\in A_{i}$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,h$. If $A_{i}=A$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,h$, we let\n\n$$\nh A=\\underbrace{A+\\cdots+A}_{h{\\mathrm{~times}}}.\n$$\n\nThe set $A$ is called a basis of order $h$ if $hA$ contains every non negative integer, that is, if every non negative integer can be represented as the sum of $h$ not necessarily distinct elements of $A$. The set $A$ is called a basis of finite order if $A$ is a basis of order $h$ for some $h\\geq1$.\n\nShnirel'man density is an important additive measure of the size of a set of integers. In particular, the set $A$ is a basis of order $h$ if and only if $\\sigma(h A)=1$, and the set $A$ is a basis of finite order if and only if $\\sigma(h A)=1$ for some $h\\geq1$.\n\nShnirel'man made the simple but extraordinarily powerful discovery that if $A$ is a set of integers that contains 0 and has positive Shnirel'man density, then $A$ is a basis of finite order.\n\nLemma 7.3 Let $A$ and $B$ be sets of integers such that $0\\in A, 0\\in B. If n\\geq0$ and $A(n)+B(n)\\geq n$, then $n\\in A+B$.",
