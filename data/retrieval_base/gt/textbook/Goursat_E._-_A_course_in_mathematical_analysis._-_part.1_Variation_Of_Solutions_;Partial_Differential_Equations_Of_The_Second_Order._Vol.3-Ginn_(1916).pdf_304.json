        "text": "(III, 41) which here is  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}(v)=\\frac{\\partial^{2}v}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=0.\n$$  \n\nThese two equations have a single family of characteristics, which consists of parallels to the $x$-axis. We shall say that one of these functions, $u(x,y)$ or $v(x,y)$, is regular in a domain $D$ if it is continuous and has continuous first partial derivatives in this domain. It will even be sufficient to say that the derivative with respect to $y$ is continuous; for if $\\partial u/\\partial y$ for example, is a continuous function, equation (1) proves that the same is true of $\\partial^{2}u/\\partial x^{2}$ and, consequently, of $\\hat{c}u/\\hat{c}x$.\n\nSince equation (1) has constant coefficients, it possesses particular integrals of the form $e^{a x + b y}$ (III, 27); the relation between $a$ and $b$ is, in this case, $b=a^{2}$. From the integral $e^{a x + a^{2}y}$ thus obtained we can derive any infinity of others by taking its successive derivatives with respect to the parameter $a$, or, what amounts to the same thing, by taking the successive coefficients of the expansion of this integral, in powers of $a$. Let us write this expansion in the form  \n\n$$\ne^{\\alpha x+a^{2}y}=1\\,+\\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\frac{n^{n}}{n!}\\,V_{n}(x,\\,y)\\,;\n$$  \n\n$V_{n}(x,y)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ in $x, y$ homogeneous in $x$ and $\\sqrt{y}$.\n\n$$\nV_{n}(x,y)\\,=\\,x^{n}\\,+\\,n(n-1)\\,x^{n-2}y\\,+\\ldots+\\frac{n(n-1)\\ldots(n-2p+1)}{p!}x^{n-2p}y^p+\\ldots\n$$  \n\nwhich is terminated by a term in $y^{\\frac{1}{2}n}$ if $n$ is even and by a term in $x y^{\\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$, if $\\pi$ is odd. These polynomials $V_{n}$ are integrals of equation (1), from their very definition. We can easily verify this by observing that equation (3), differentiated with respect to $x$ and to $y$, gives the relations  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\,V_{n}}{\\partial x}\\,=\\,n\\,V_{n-1},\\qquad\\frac{\\partial\\,V_{n}}{\\partial y}\\,=\\,n(n\\,-\\,1)\\,\\,V_{n-2},\n$$",
