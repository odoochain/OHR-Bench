This near weightlessness is due to its continuous state of free-fall around the Earth not considering a small amount of atmospheric drag. An accounting of precisely how weightless comes by virtue of the Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS) which monitors the quasi-steady acceleration environment 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nThe ISS offers a microgravity research platform for those who need to leverage its unique environment. The space station is over 350 feet ( 109 m ) wide and has 3 separate, main laboratory modules, each roughly the size of a school bus. Each laboratory has a multitude of equipment, some related to science operations and some related to life-support. Centrifuges, fans, pumps, compressors, structural bending, etc. all contribute to tiny vibrations over a wide range of frequencies that are monitored continuously by sensors distributed in locations designated for support by the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). These SAMS measurements along with those from MAMS give researchers, technology developers, and structural analysts the information they need to do their work, whether it is principal investigators studying fluid or combustion behavior in microgravity, or analysts tracking the structural integrity of the ISS.",

Systems and processes affected by microgravity include surface wetting and interfacial tension, multiphase flow and heat transfer, multiphase system dynamics, solidification, and fire phenomena and combustion. Microgravity induces a vast array of changes in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, including global alterations in gene expression and 3-D aggregation of cells into tissue-like architecture.\n2. Extreme conditions in the ISS environment include exposure to extreme heat and cold cycling, ultra-vacuum, atomic oxygen, and high-energy radiation. Testing and qualification of materials exposed to these extreme conditions have provided data to enable the manufacturing of longlife, reliable components used on Earth as well as in the world's most sophisticated satellite and spacecraft components.\n3. Low-Earth orbit at 51 degrees inclination and at a 90-minute orbit affords ISS a unique vantage point with an altitude of approximately 240 miles ( 400 kilometers) and an orbital path over 90 percent of the Earth's population. This can provide improved spatial resolution and variable lighting conditions compared to the sun-synchronous orbits of typical Earth remote-sensing satellites.",

        "text": "Components of Microgravity Environment\n\nThe acceleration environment of any orbiting spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) is not truly \"zero G\" as sometimes assumed. This popular idiom applies only to the vehicle's center of mass, a point that is not necessarily a physical part of the spacecraft's structure. All the rest of the mass that comprise the vehicle or are otherwise attached to it will experience accelerations from a variety of sources, such as pumps, fans, thrusters, atmospheric drag, rotational forces and others. These accelerations are often referred to as disturbances in that they can introduce undesired effects. These disturbances are mostly transmitted mechanically through the vehicle structure or acoustically through the air within the habitable modules.\n\nA prismatic view of the ISS acceleration environment reveals a broad spectrum of vibrational frequencies, ranging from the relatively low-magnitude, low-frequency portion referred to as the quasi-steady regime up through the relatively highfrequency, high-magnitude vibratory regime. Without any additional payload vibration isolation, the ISS acceleration spectrum ranges from on the order of much less than a micro-g at the low-frequency end $(<0.1 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ to well over 10 milli-g at the high-frequency end of the spectrum. With available ISS payload vibration isolation systems, the acceleration environment can further be reduced by up to a factor of 100 so as to sometimes meet the ISS microgravity requirements.\n\nAnother aspect of the acceleration environment to consider is the transient regime, which is associated with relatively brief and relatively high-magnitude accelerations, such as those introduced by a vehicle docking, thruster firing, or even a crew push-off or crew landing. These impulsive events do not fall neatly into either the quasi-steady regime or the vibratory regime. When we consider its spectral decomposition, we see that this type of disturbance has impact over a wide portion of the acceleration spectrum.\n\nWhy use the label microgravity? Well, if we consider only the low-frequency, lowmagnitude accelerations, then we note that those are approximately one-millionth of what would be experienced at the surface of the Earth-one-millionth, hence the prefix \"micro.\" This label, of course, is oversimplified and not intended to completely characterize the dynamic acceleration environment of the ISS. See Figure 1 Microgravity Environment Components for an overview of microgravity environment acceleration components.",

        "text": "Figure 1. Microgravity Environment Components\n\nThe Quasi-Steady Regime\n\nThe quasi-steady regime is comprised of accelerations at the lower end of the spectrum (below 0.01 hertz ) and with magnitudes on the order of less than a micro-g. These low-frequency disturbances are associated with phenomena related to the ISS orbital rate of about 90 minutes, and primarily are due to aerodynamic drag and vehicle rotation. The drag exerted on the space station comes from a thin atmosphere that exists even at a nominal altitude of about 200 miles. This drag varies as the ISS traverses a slightly elliptical orbit through the atmosphere with thermal variations throughout. Denser portions give rise to more drag and thus higher acceleration levels. In its nominal attitude (+XVV +ZLV), the aerodynamic drag exerted on the ISS is primarily manifested on the two axes aligned with its orbital trajectory. One axis is aligned with the local vertical axis (the Z-axis), and one axis is aligned with the velocity vector or direction of travel (the X-axis). See\n\n\nFigure 2. Space Station Analysis (SSA) Coordinate System Figure 2 Space Station Analysis (SSA) Coordinate System for a depiction of this attitude and a description of the SSA coordinate system.\n\nGravity gradient and rotational effects are key factors in shaping the quasi-steady regime. Both of these factors depend on the location of interest relative to the vehicle's center of mass. The gravity gradient component stems from the fact that",

        "text": "Earth's gravitational tug decreases according to the inverse-square law, whereby the lower part of the orbiting structure will get a slightly stronger tug from the Earth. Rotational effects come about from the attitude maintained by the ISS. In essence, the space station tumbles or rotates once per orbit.\n\nThe Vibratory Regime\n\nThe vibratory regime is comprised of vibrations in the acceleration spectrum above 0.01 hertz. These vibrations result from motion of the vehicle, crew or experimentrelated equipment. The omnipresent flexing and bending of vehicle structure, crew sleep/wake cycles, crew exercise, turbulent airflow, and rotating/reciprocating machinery are some of the disturbance sources that play a role in shaping this vibratory regime. In general, as the vibrational frequency under consideration increases, the more localized the effect of these disturbances tends to be. Vehicle subsystems such as those needed for life support, thermal control or communications produce significant disturbances here. The impact of these is primarily a function of proximity to the disturbance source. In a similar way, experiment-related equipment needed to support or conduct scientific investigations on the space station can play a major role, particularly as disturbances to other payloads in their vicinity.\n\nVehicle Structural Modes\n\nVehicle structural modes reside at the low-frequency end of the vibratory portion of the acceleration spectrum. These vibrations fall within the frequency range from about 0.1 hertz to about 5 hertz. These vibrations arise from the excitation of natural frequencies associated with large components of the space station structure, such as the main truss, and with fundamental appendage modes, such as solar arrays. These structures are typically excited by relatively large magnitude, relatively brief impulsive events like during a reboost or by crew locomotive events like push-offs. The driving excitation of such events results in response vibrations as structural ringing damps out. Also, relatively small magnitude vibrations at just the right frequency will give rise to structural resonance. Structural vibrations propagate via mechanical linkage. While the frequency of these disturbances may be registered the same throughout the space station, their amplitude is a function of location. Structural mode vibrations tend to be low amplitude during crew sleep periods relative to crew active periods owing to the absence of impulsive push-off and landing events by the crew on space station structure.\n\nAfter assembly complete, the first such structural mode of the ISS, sometimes referred to as \"mode one\" is nominally at about 0.1 hertz. During quiet periods such",

Conversely, the color spectrogram in Figure 4 Spectrogram Showing Mode One with Crew Slow Transition to Sleep for that same day shows mode one along with other structural vibrations tapering off after GMT 21:00 with transition toward weaker (blue) magnitudes.\n\nIn the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) and in the Columbus Module (COL), mode one is about two orders of magnitude less during quiet periods. In addition to mode one, there is a cluster of modes below 5 hertz that further characterize the vibrations of large space station structures. These are noted along with the location",

Geometry, structural dynamics and sensor location account for this difference.\n\nCrew Exercise\n\nNext in the vibratory regime, we examine crew exercise. Exercise is an important part of the crew's daily routine. In addition to promoting fitness, this activity is geared to help prevent bone and muscle loss associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity. On average, each crew member is scheduled to exercise approximately",

There are three basic types of exercise equipment that the crew can use including a treadmill, a cycle ergometer and a resistive apparatus.\n\nThe space station has one treadmill in Node 3 referred to as \"T2\" and another one in the Service Module, which is called the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (TVIS). The TVIS is suspended over an opening in the floor, which allows for movement of the treadmill into and back out of this opening. The vibration isolation system serves to minimize the transfer of exercise forces from the treadmill to the ISS structure. There are a couple of cycle ergometers on the ISS: the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) located in the USL, and the Veloergometer (Velo) located in the Service Module. These devices provide controlled workloads for the crew. The CEVIS is located in the USL where the astronauts strap themselves in. The CEVIS was designed to counteract crew motions in order to attenuate the transfer of its vibratory disturbances to the space station. The last type of exercise equipment comes in the form of the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) located in Node 3. This is a resistive device that simulates gravity. The ARED provides the capability to do both upper- and lower-body exercises including squats, dead lifts, heel raises, bicep curls and bench press. This equipment has built-in vibration isolation as well.\n\nIn general, these exercise equipment were designed to maintain the ISS microgravity environment. However, factors outside of their design envelope can play a role in this activity having an impact on the environment. As a result, this activity can excite vehicle structural modes depending on the frequency of exercise movement and on",

In addition, exercise will introduce its own, unique signature in the vibratory regime. Typically, these signatures are manifest below about 3 hertz. The color spectrogram of Figure 5 Spectrogram Showing Crew Exercise Periods and Relative Quiet Period shows a couple of bouts of exercise between about GMT 10:00 and 11:00 with the strongest impact (red horizontal streaks) seen below 3 hertz. Interesting to note in this figure also is the relative quiet crew period ending at about GMT 13:30 as indicated by the vertical dark blue region. This indicates most or all of the crew members were relatively still for the 15 minutes or so of the dark blue span.\n\nUrine Processor Assembly (UPA)\nAnother noticeable, but weak, disturbance source in the vibratory regime is the UPA, which is part of the ISS water recovery system in Node 3. The UPA houses a distillation assembly centrifuge that was designed to spin at 220 rpm ( 3.67 hertz). Onboard acceleration measurements indicate that it often rotates closer to 221 rpm (3.68 hertz).

The impact of this disturbance was measured by SAMS in the USL, and is also evident in SAMS measurements from the COL. The signature from this equipment, however, is much less clear in the JEM. To summarize, the UPA injects a weak narrowband signature at just over 3.6 hertz. This narrowband disturbance is most distinctive in the USL, with RMS levels of around 38 ug at the SAMS es06 sensor location; with RMS levels in the JEM of about 6 ug at the SAMS 121 f05 sensor location.

Also, use Table 2 as a reference for sensor locations on the ISS.\n\nKu-Band Antenna\n\nThe Ku-band antenna provides a link for payload communications between the ISS and ground stations throughout the world. The antenna is also referred to as the space-to-ground antenna and is mounted on a two-axis gimbal assembly to allow the dish to rotate for acquisition and line-of-sight tracking of data relay satellites. The vibratory signature of the Ku-band antenna is persistent and distributed mainly over the frequency range from about 5 hertz to about 20 hertz. Extended durations of auto-tracking while locked on current target satellite are punctuated by occasional, brief spatial acquisition iterations to lock on to the next target satellite and the vibratory motions associated with these functions are seen as twin spectral peaks at about 5.2 hertz and 7.8 hertz. Superimposed, there is a broad spectral hump between about 5 and 8 hertz, which gets registered to varying degrees throughout the ISS. The magnitude of this disturbance at any given sensor location is not a function of quiet versus nominal periods, like sleep versus wake, because this communications link is maintained around the clock; it does vary with",

Its acceleration signature is characterized by a semi-regular pattern of frequency sweeps that are evident on a time scale of an orbital period.

It is tightly controlled in frequency producing narrowband vibrations at 23.5 hertz. These vibrations were measured as loudest in the USL at the 121 f 03 and 121 f 04 locations at about 29 ugRMS.\n\nSAMS Fan\n\nThere is a SAMS fan that produces a narrowband vibration at 47 hertz. This disturbance is only detectable at sensor locations near ER1 in the USL. At the SAMS 121 f04 location on LAB1O2, it is registered with an RMS level of about 174 ug.\n\nGeneral Laboratory Active Cryogenic International Space Station Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER)\n\nThe GLACIER is a water-cooled freezer that provides cryogenic transportation and preservation of samples requiring temperatures as low as minus 160 degrees Celsius. Acceleration spectral analysis shows the vibratory impact of this equipment was focused primarily in three narrowband peaks at 60 hertz, 120 hertz, and 180 hertz. Since these are common operating frequencies, it is likely that some of the energy in these bands is attributable to other equipment as well. Acceleration measurements indicate the epicenter of this disturbance's 60 hertz component is in the USL near ER1 (the 121 f 04 location on LAB1O2 at about 1027 ugRMS), and it was also loud near ER2 (the 121 f03 location on LAB1O1 at about 911 ugRMS) and to a much lesser extent near the MSG (the 121 f 02 location at about 97 ugRMS).

Both fans are then shut down during the transition from the port side CCAA to the starboard CCAA. Operation of the water separator results in the primary impact of this system on the microgravity environment. The water separator has a narrowband signature at about 98 hertz and imparts RMS levels as follows (see Table 2 for sensor locations): about 557 ugRMS at the 121 f 03 location, 397 ugRMS at the 121 f 02 location, 232 ugRMS at the 121 f04 location, and 39 ugRMS at the SAMS es06 location.\n\nControl Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs)\n\nThere are four CMGs located on the Z1 truss structure of the ISS.

These accelerations are associated with events like thruster firings for reboosts or attitude maneuvers, which are more globally felt and can include crew push-offs and landings, which tend to be more localized.

Foremost in this pursuit is to capture, process and archive the acceleration measurements, which continuously stream from the space station. Furthermore, it offers analysis services for the microgravity community in general and with the capability to provide tailored products for scientific payloads, structural dynamics monitoring, and technology developers. As a means to fulfill its acceleration program goals, the GRC sponsors the SAMS, the Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS), and the PIMS projects.\n\nSpace Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS)\n\nSAMS has been a cornerstone in the ongoing effort to provide continuous access to the vibratory environment on the ISS. This system has a proven track record of sustained, reliable performance. It first flew in June 1991 and has flown on nearly every major microgravity science mission on the space shuttle. In addition, SAMS was used for four years aboard the Russian space station, Mir, where it measured accelerations in support of scientific investigations. SAMS has been onboard the ISS since 2001. It has streamed acceleration measurement data nearly continuously since then in support of principal investigators, technology developers, and the microgravity community at-large. Last, but certainly not least, SAMS also plays an integral role in daily loads and dynamics monitoring and feeds into the detailed analysis aimed at preserving structural integrity and possibly extending the longevity of the ISS as a microgravity research platform.\n\nSAMS has the ability to instrument and measure the local vibratory regime ( 0.01 $<\\mathrm{f}<300$ hertz) in all three of the ISS laboratories, including throughout the USL. The accelerations it measures arise from vehicle activities and subsystems, experiment operations, crew movements, and structural dynamics. SAMS Remote Triaxial Sensor (RTS) systems are used primarily to monitor the local vibratory environment for individual experiments requiring acceleration measurement support, and for daily vehicle structural monitoring. Each RTS is capable of measuring acceleration disturbances between 0.01 hertz and 400 hertz. Each RTS consists of two components: the RTS sensor enclosure (SE), and the RTS electronics enclosure (EE). The RTS-SE, is mounted as close to the experiment as possible. There, it measures and translates the data into a digital signal, which gets routed to its RTS-EE. The RTS-EE, in turn, sends the acceleration data to the SAMS Control Unit (CU). The",
