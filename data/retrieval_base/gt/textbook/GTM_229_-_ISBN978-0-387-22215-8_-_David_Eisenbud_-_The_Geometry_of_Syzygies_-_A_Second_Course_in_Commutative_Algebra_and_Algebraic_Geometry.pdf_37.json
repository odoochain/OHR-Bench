        "text": "Two linear forms that generate the ideal of the line, together with any form of degree 7 vanishing on the points but not on the line. But Theorem 4.2(c) tells us that since the 7 points of $X$ are in linearly general position, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $S_{X}$ (defined in Chapter 4) is 2, or equivalently, that the Betti diagram of $S_{X}$ fits into 3 rows. Moreover, the ring $S_{X}$ is reduced and of dimension 1, so it has depth 1. The Auslander-Buchsbaum Formula A2.15 shows that the resolution will have length 3. Putting this together, and using Corollary 1.9, we see that the minimal free resolution of $S_{X}$ must have a Betti diagram of the form  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{}}&{{}}&{{{{}} {{0}} {{1}} {{2}} {{3}} {{0}} {{1}} {{-}} {{-}} {{-}} {{1}} {{-}} {{\\beta_{1,2}}} {{\\beta_{2,3}}} {{\\beta_{3,4}}} {{2}} {{-}} {{\\beta_{1,3}}} {{\\beta_{2,4}}} {{\\beta_{3,5}}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the $\\beta_{i,j}$ that are not shown are zero. In particular, the ideal of $X$ is generated by quadrics and cubics.  \n\nUsing Corollary 1.10, we compute successively $\\beta_{1,2}=3$, $\\beta_{1,3}-\\beta_{2,3}=1$, $\\beta_{2,4}-\\beta_{3,4}=6$, $\\beta_{3,5}=3$, and the Betti diagram has the form  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{}}&{{}}&{{{{}} {{0}} {{1}} {{2}} {{3}} {{0}} {{1}} {{-}} {{-}} {{-}} {{1}} {{-}} {{3}} {{\\beta_{2,3}}} {{\\beta_{3,4}}} {{2}} {{-}} {{1+\\beta_{2,3}}} {{6+\\beta_{3,4}}} {{3}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n(This is the same diagram as at the end of the previous section. Here is the connection: Extending the ground field if necessary to make it infinite, we could use Lemma A2.3 and choose a linear form $x\\in S$ that is a nonzero divisor on $S_{X}$. By Lemma 3.15, the graded Betti numbers of $S_{X}/x S_{X}$ as an $S/x S$ -module are the same as those of $S_{X}$ as an $S$ -module. Using our knowledge of the Hilbert function of $S_{X}$ and the exactness of the sequence  \n\n$$\n0\\longrightarrow S_{X}(-1)\\stackrel{x}{\\longrightarrow}S_{X}\\longrightarrow S_{X}/x S_{x}\\longrightarrow0,\n$$  \n\nwe see that the cyclic $(S/x S)$ -module $S_{X}/x S_{x}$ has a Hilbert function with values $1, 3, 3$. This is what we used in Section 2B.)  \n\n# ..and Other Information in the Resolution  \n\nWe see that even in this simple case, the Hilbert function does not determine the $\\beta_{i,j}$, and indeed they can take different values. It turns out that the difference reflects a fundamental geometric distinction between different sets $X$ of 7 points in linearly general position in $\\mathbb{P^{3}}$: whether or not $X$ lies on a curve of degree 3.  \n\nUp to linear automorphisms of $\\mathbb{P}^{3}$, there is only one irreducible curve of degree 3 not contained in a plane. This twisted cubic is one of the rational normal curves studied in Chapter 6. Any 6 points in linearly general position in $\\mathbb{P}^{3}$ lie",
