        "text": "PROOF. The quotient space $E/F$ is Hausdorff and finite-dimensional, and the natural projection $\\pi\\colon E\\,\\rightarrow\\,E/F$ is continuous. Its restriction $\\pi|_{G}$ to $G$ is an algebraic, hence by the proven theorem also a topological isomorphism between $G$ and $E/F$. The projection $p_{G}\\colon E\\to G$ has the form $p_{G}=(\\pi|_{G})^{-1}\\circ\\pi,$ hence is continuous.\n\n1.5.4. Definition. A subset $A$ of a topological vector space $E$ is called precompact and totally bounded if for every neighborhood of zero $V$ in $E$ one can find a finite set $\\{a_{1},\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}\\}$ in $E$ such that $\\textstyle A\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+V)$.\n\nThe set $\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}$ is called a finite $V$-net (or an $\\varepsilon$-net if $V$ is a ball of radius $\\varepsilon$ in a metric space). It is easily seen that every compact set in a topological vector space is precompact. We observe (this fact is not needed now, so it will be proven in $\\S\\,1.8$ after we discuss completions of topological vector spaces) that a subset of a topological vector space is precompact precisely when its closure in the completion of this topological vector space is compact. However, the closure of a precompact set in an incomplete space may fail to be compact.\n\n1.5.5. Lemma. Every precompact subset of a topological vector space is bounded.\n\nPROOF. Let $A$ be a precompact subset of a topological vector space $E$ and let $V$ be a neighborhood of zero in $E$; we have to prove that there exists $\\nu>0$ such that $A\\subset t V$ if $|t|>\\nu$. Let $W$ be a circled neighborhood of zero such that $W+W\\subset V$ and let $a_{1},\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}$ be elements of $E$ for which $\\textstyle A\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+W)$. Let $\\nu>1$ be such that $\\{a_{1},\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}\\}\\,\\subset\\,t W$ if $|t|>\\nu$. Then for such numbers $t$ we have\n\n$$\nA\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+W)\\subset t W+W\\subset t W+t W=t(W+W)\\subset t V,\n$$\n\nwhich shows that $A$ is bounded.\n\n1.5.6. Theorem. A Hausdorff topological vector space $E$ over the field $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ is finite-dimensional if and only if it possesses a compact neighborhood of zero. Moreover, it is sufficient that it possess a precompact neighborhood of zero.\n\nPROOF. The necessity is clear from Theorem 1.5.1, since any Hausdorff topological vector space (over an on discrete complete normed field $\\mathbb{K}$) of finite dimension $n$ is isomorphic (as a topological vector space) to the space ${\\mathbb K}^{n}$, and if $S$ is a compact neighborhood of zero in $\\mathbb{K}$ then the product of $n$ copies of $S$ is a compact neighborhood of zero in $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$.\n\nLet us prove the sufficiency (the given proof is due to Gleason). Let $V$ be a precompact neighborhood of zero in $E$ and let $a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\in E$ be elements such that\n\n$$\nV\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}{\\Big(}a_{k}+{\\frac{1}{2}}V{\\Big)}.\n$$\n\nWe show that the linear span of the set $A\\;=\\;\\{a_{1},\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}\\}$ coincides with the whole space, i.e., that every element in $E$ is a linear combination of elements of $A$.",
