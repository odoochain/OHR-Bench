Heuristically, when $V\\equiv1$, the first term in (3.34) and (3.35) is due to the volume energy which always has a tendency to “shrink” (in order to minimize), while the second $\\pm\\beta e^{-2\\lambda(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}-\\rho)}$ the boundary “pushes” the mass of the solution away from the boundary (therefore only single-peak solutions are possible), but in the Neumann case the boundary “pulls” the mass of the solution and thereby reaches a balance at $\\varepsilon\\rho=r_{\\varepsilon}\\sim1-\\varepsilon|\\log\\varepsilon|$ creating an extra solution.  \n\nWe remark that the method described above also applies to the annulus case and yields the following interesting results for $V\\equiv1$, which illustrate the opposite effects between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions most vividly.  \n\n# Theorem 3.11 (see [AMN3]).  \n\n(i) For every $p>1$ and $\\varepsilon$ small, the Neumann problem (3.1) with $\\Omega=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\mid0<a<$   $|x|<b\\}$ possesses a solution concentrating at $|x|=r_{\\varepsilon}$, where $b-r_{\\varepsilon}\\sim\\varepsilon|\\log\\varepsilon|$, near the outer boundary $|x|=b$.  \n\n(ii) For every $p>1$ and $\\varepsilon$ small, the Dirichlet problem (3.2) with $\\Omega=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\,\\vert\\,0<a<$   $|x|<b\\}$ possesses a solution concentrating at $|x|=r_{\\varepsilon}$, where $r_{\\varepsilon}-a\\sim\\varepsilon|\\log\\varepsilon|$, near the inner boundary $|x|=a$.  \n\nObserve that from the “moving plane” method [GNN1] it follows easily that the Dirichlet problem (3.2) does not have a solution concentrating on a sphere near the outer boundary $|x|=b$.  \n\nIn conclusion, we mention that the method of Theorem 3.10 can be extended to produce solutions with $k$-dimensional concentration sets, but again, some symmetry assumptions are needed. Other interesting progress in this direction includes a one-dimensional concentration set in the interior of a two-dimensional domain due to [WY]. The conjecture stated at the beginning of this section remains largely a major open problem.  \n\n# 3.1.4 Remarks  \n\nIn Section 3.1, we have considered the various concentration phenomena for essentially just one equation, namely,  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{2}\\Delta u-u+u^{p}=0\n$$  \n\nin a bounded domain $\\Omega$ under either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions in (3.2) or (3.1), respectively. However, since (3.36) is quite basic, similar phenomena could be",
