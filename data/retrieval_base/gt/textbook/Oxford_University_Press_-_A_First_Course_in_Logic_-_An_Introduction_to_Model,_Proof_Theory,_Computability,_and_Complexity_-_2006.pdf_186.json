        "text": "(ii) Otherwise $\\varphi_{\\gamma}$ has the form $\\exists x\\theta(x)$. In this case, let $T_{\\gamma+1}$ be $T_{\\gamma}\\cup\\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\}\\cup$ $\\{\\theta(c)\\}$ where $c$ is a constant in $C$ that does not occur in $T_{\\gamma}\\cup\\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\}$. Since $T_{\\gamma}$ contains fewer than $\\kappa$ constants of $C$, such a $c$ exists.  \n\nSo if $\\beta=\\gamma+1$, then $T_{\\beta}=T_{\\gamma+1}$ is obtained by adding at most a sentence or two to $T_{\\gamma}$. Since $T_{\\gamma}$ contains at most $|\\gamma|+\\aleph_{0}$ of the constants in $C$, so does $T_{\\beta}$. Moreover, $T_{\\beta}$ can be shown to be consistent in the same manner that $T_{m+1}$ was shown to be consistent in the first claim in the proof of Theorem 4.2.  \n\nNow suppose that $\\beta$ is not a successor ordinal. Then it is a limit ordinal. In this case, define $T_{\\beta}$ as the set of all $\\nu^{+}$ -sentences that occur in $T_{\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma<\\beta$. Again, we claim that $T_{\\beta}$ is consistent and contains at most $|\\beta|+\\aleph_{0}$ of the constants in $C$.  \n\n# Claim 1: $T_{\\beta}$ is consistent.  \n\nProof: Suppose $T_{\\beta}$ is not consistent. Then $T_{\\beta}\\vdash\\bot$ for some contradiction $\\perp$. Since formal proofs are finite, $\\Delta\\vdash\\bot$ for some finite subset $\\Delta$ of $T_{\\beta}$. Since it is finite, $\\Delta\\subset T_{\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma<\\beta$. But this contradicts our assumption that any such $T_{\\gamma}$ is consistent. We conclude that $T_{\\beta}$ must be consistent as was claimed.  \n\nClaim 2: $T_{\\beta}$ contains at most $|\\beta|$ of the constants in $C$.  \n\nProof: For each $\\gamma<\\beta$, let $C_{\\gamma}$ be the set of constants in $C$ that occur in $T_{\\gamma}$. Then $T_{\\beta}$ $U_{\\gamma<\\beta}\\,C_{\\gamma}$. $|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq|\\gamma|+\\aleph_{0}\\leq$ $|\\beta|+\\aleph_{0}$. Since we are assuming that $\\beta$ is a limit ordinal, $\\beta$ is infinite. In particular, $\\left|\\beta\\right|+\\aleph_{0}=\\left|\\beta\\right|$. So each $|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq|\\beta|$. It follows that the number of constants from $C$ occurring in $T_{\\beta}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\bigcup_{\\gamma<\\beta}C_{\\gamma}\\right|\\leq\\sum_{\\gamma<\\beta}|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq\\sum_{\\gamma<\\beta}|\\beta|=|\\beta|\\cdot|\\beta|=|\\beta|.\n$$  \n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.  \n\nSo for each $\\beta<\\alpha$, we have successfully defined a $\\nu^{+}$ -theory $T_{\\beta}$. These have been defined in such a way that $T_{\\beta_{1}}\\subset T_{\\beta_{2}}$ for $\\beta_{1}<\\beta_{2}<\\alpha$.  \n\nWe now define $T_{\\alpha}$ as the set of all $\\nu^{+}$ -sentences that occur in $T_{\\beta}$ for some $\\beta<\\alpha$. Like each $T_{\\beta}$, $T_{\\alpha}$ is a theory. This can be proved in the same manner as Claim 1 above. Unlike $T_{\\beta}$ for $\\beta<\\alpha$, $T_{\\alpha}$ is a complete theory. This is because each $\\nu^{+}$ -sentence is enumerated as $\\varphi_{\\ell}$ for some $\\iota<\\alpha$. Either $\\varphi_{t}$ or $\\neg\\varphi_{\\iota}$ is in $T_{t+1}$ and, hence, in $T_{\\alpha}$ as well.  \n\nSince $\\Gamma=T_{0}\\subset T_{\\alpha}$, $T_{\\alpha}$ has Property 1. Moreover, part (b)ii of the definition of $T_{\\gamma+1}\\subset T_{\\alpha}$ guarantees that $T_{\\alpha}$ has Property 2. It was shown in the proof of Theorem 4.2 that any complete theory with Property 2 has a model. Therefore, $T_{\\alpha}$ has a model and $\\Gamma$ is satisfiable.",
