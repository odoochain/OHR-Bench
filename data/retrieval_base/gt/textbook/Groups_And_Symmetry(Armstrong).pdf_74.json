Let $O$ denote the subgroup of $E_{2}$ which consists of the orthogonal transformations. In other words, the elements of $O$ are rotations about the origin and reflections in lines through the origin. The discussion in the previous paragraph shows that $E_{2}=T O$.\n\nThe intersection of $T$ and $O$ is just the identity transformation because every non-trivial translation moves the origin, whereas every element of $O$ keeps the origin fixed. The usual argument now shows that each isometry can be written in only one way as an orthogonal transformation followed by a translation. For if $g=\\tau f=\\tau^{\\prime}f^{\\prime}$ where $\\tau, \\tau^{\\prime}\\in T$ and $f,f^{\\prime}\\in O$, then $(\\tau^{\\prime})^{-1}\\tau=f^{\\prime}f^{-1}$ lies in $T\\cap O$ and hence $\\tau=\\tau^{\\prime}, f=f^{\\prime}$. If $g=\\tau f$ and if $f$ is a rotation, then $g$ is called a direct isometry. In the other case, when $f$ is a reflection, $g$ is said to be an opposite isometry.\n\nSuppose $f\\in O, \\tau\\in T$ and $\\tau(\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{v}$. Then for each $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{f\\tau f^{-1}(\\mathbf{x})=f(\\mathbf{v}+f^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}))}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=f(\\mathbf{v})+f(f^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}))\\qquad\\mathrm{because~}f\\mathrm{~is~linear~}}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=f(\\mathbf{v})+\\mathbf{x}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore the conjugate $f\\tau f^{-1}$ is translation by the vector $f(\\mathbf{v})$. Since the elements of $T$ and $O$ together generate $E_{2}$, we see (using (15.2)) that $T$ is a normal subgroup of $E_{2}$.\n\nWe can now understand the product structure of our group in terms of the decomposition $E_{2}=T O$. If $g=\\tau f, h=\\tau_{1}f_{1}$ where $\\tau, \\tau_{1}\\in T$ and $f, f_{1}\\in O$, then\n\n$$\ngh=\\tau f\\tau_{1}f_{1}=(\\tau f\\tau_{1}f^{-1})(ff_{1})\n$$  \n\nexpresses $gh$ as an orthogonal transformation followed by a translation. Put another way, the correspondence  \n\n$$\ng\\rightarrow(\\tau,f)\n$$  \n\nis an isomorphism between $E_{2}$ and the semi-direct product $T\\times_{\\varphi}O$ where $\\varphi\\colon O\\to\\mathrm{Aut}(T)$ is given by conjugation.\n\nSpecific calculations are best carried out using rather different notation. Suppose $g=\\tau f$ where $\\tau\\in T$ and $f\\in O$. If $\\mathbf{v}=\\tau(\\mathbf{0})$, and if $M$ is the orthogonal matrix which represents $f$ in the standard basis for $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then  \n\n$$\ng(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{v}+f_{M}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{x}M^{t}\n$$  \n\nfor all $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Conversely, given $\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $M\\in O_{2}$, the formula $(*)$ determines an isometry of the plane. We may therefore think of each isometry as an ordered pair $(\\mathbf{v},M)$ in which $\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $M\\in O_{2}$, with multiplication given by  \n\n$$\n({\\bf v},M)({\\bf v}_{1},M_{1})=({\\bf v}+f_{M}({\\bf v}_{1}),M M_{1}).\n$$  \n\nIf we are pressed to be very precise, we explain that we have identified $E_{2}$ with the semi-direct product $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\times_{\\psi}O_{2}$, the homomorphism $\\psi:O_{2}\\to\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ being the usual action of $O_{2}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Notice that $(\\mathbf{v},M)$ is a direct isometry when det $M=+1$ and an opposite isometry when det $M=-1$.\n\nThe \"simplest\" isometries are easily described as ordered pairs. Let  \n\n$$\nA={\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\cos\\theta}&{}&{-\\sin\\theta}\\\\ {\\sin\\theta}&{}&{\\cos\\theta}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]},\\qquad B={\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\cos\\varphi}&{}&{\\sin\\varphi}\\\\ {\\sin\\varphi}&{}&{-\\cos\\varphi}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}\n$$  \n\nand let $l, m$ be the lines shown in Figure 24.3.\n\n  \nFigure 24.3",
