        "text": "For $\\pmb{p}$ a prime and $(a, p) = 1$, let the Legendre symbol $\\left(a\\vert p\\right)$ (classical notation $\\scriptstyle\\left({\\frac{a}{p}}\\right)$) denote 1 when $\\pmb{a}$ is a square mod $\\pmb{p}$ and $^{-1}$ when $\\pmb{a}$ is not a square mod $\\pmb{p}$. With this notation, the previous theorem says that $a^{(p-1)/2}\\equiv(a|p)(p)$ when $\\pmb{p}$ is a prime and $\\pmb{a}$ is prime to $\\pmb{p}$. The following important result will be proved in the third section of chapter 4.\n\nTHE QUADRATIC RECIPROCITY THEOREM. Suppose that $p$ and $\\pmb q$ are odd primes. Then\n\n$$\n(p|q)(q|p)=(-1)^{(p-1)(q-1)/4}.\n$$\n\nNote. In other words, the product $(p|q)(q|p)$ equals 1 unless both $\\pmb{p}$ and $\\pmb q$ are $\\equiv 3$ mod 4, in which case it equals $^{-1}$.\n\nNote. This result, first proved by Gauss in 1801, is one of the most famous and beautiful results in number theory.\n\nR. Define $\\left(a\\vert p\\right)$ to be zero when $\\mathcal{P}$ divides $\\pmb{a}$. It is obvious that $\\left(a|p\\right)=\\left(b|p\\right)$ when $a\\equiv b\\,\\left(p\\right)$. Prove that $(a b|p)=(a|p)(b|p)$. (Hint: This amounts to the statement that the product of two squares mod $\\pmb{p}$ is a square mod $\\pmb{p}$, etc. At one point it is useful to know that there are as many squares as non-squares.)\n\nR. Verify that $(-1|p)=(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ and that $(a|2)=1$ for all odd integers $\\pmb{a}$.\n\nExamples\n\nAny odd prime has the form $6k+\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon\\,=\\,\\pm1$. Hence $(p|3) = (6k + \\epsilon | 3) = (\\epsilon | 3) = \\epsilon$, for 1 is a square mod 3 but not ${-1}$. Similarly $p\\equiv\\pm1$ or $\\pm2 {\\bmod{5}} $. In the first case, $(p|5)=1$, in the second $(p|5)=-1$.\n\nExercise\n\nDo the same computations with 7 taking the place of 5.\n\nThe quadratic reciprocity theorem has the following complement\n\nTHEOREM. When $p>2$ is a prime, $(2|p)=(-1)^{c}$, where $c={\\left(p^{2}-1\\right)}/{8}$.\n\nNote. The proof below is similar to one of Gauss's proofs of the quadratic reciprocity theorem.\n\nNote. Using this result and the quadratic reciprocity theorem, we can compute any $\\left(n|p\\right)$ with $\\pmb{p}$ prime. In fact, reducing $\\pmb{n}$ modulo $p_{i}$ we can assume that $1\\,\\leq\\,n\\,<\\,p$ and then factor $\\pmb{\\mathscr{n}}$ into powers of primes. Since $(a b|p)=(a|p)(b|p)$, this reduces the problem to the quadratic reciprocity theorem and the computation of $(2|p)$.\n\nProoF: We are going to consider the numbers $C=\\{1,2,\\ldots,(p-1)/2\\}$ whose sum is $c\\,=\\,(p^{2}\\,-\\,1)/8$, and the set $2C=\\{2,4,\\ldots,p-1\\}$.
