        "text": "While picketing is a mode of communication, it is inseparably something more and different. The very purpose of a picket line is to exert influence, and it produces consequences, different from other modes of communication. ——Justice Felix Frankfurter, 1950  \n\nBusiness. Many people will not cross a picket line, depriving a business of its workers and customers.  \n\nThrough much of American history, courts have supported many kinds of restraints on labor picketing. Then, in Thornhill v. Alabama1 (1940), the Supreme Court ruled that peaceful picketing was a form of free speech. It reflected the growing strength of the labor movement in American life.  \n\nIn later decisions, however, the Court severely limited the position it took in Thornhill. In Hughes v. Superior Court2 (1950), the Court refused to overturn a California court's ban on picketing at a supermarket to force it to hire African American workers. The Court wrote: This and other protestors demonstrated during the August 1997 Teamsters-UPS labor dispute which crippled the nation for 15 days.  \n\n\n\nSee the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook: 1. Thornhill v. Alabama case summary, page 766. 2. Hughes v. Superior Court case summary, page 759.\n\nIn 1996, Gladiola Campos joined 1,000 other college students and activists in a program called Union Summer. The program, which was sponsored by the AFL-CIO, was designed to strengthen the nation's labor movement by encouraging people to join unions and protest unfair labor practices. It was modeled after Freedom Summer, a similar program in 1964 in which students were bussed across the South to register African American voters. Union Summer participants were paid \\$210 a week and traveled to various parts of the country to help draw attention to unfair labor practices. Students helped sewage-plant employees protesting in Denver, put pressure on a Washington store to stop selling clothing made in sweatshops, and picketed hotels in South Carolina for their unfair labor practices.\n\nCampos, a University of Texas student, was sent to Los Angeles. One of her projects was distributing leaflets outside a hotel to urge people to boycott the establishment. The owners of the hotel had been blocking their employees' efforts to organize a union for three years. Many of the employees were Hispanic immigrants.\n\nThe union issue hits close to home with Campos. Her mother was a maintenance worker when she was growing up in El Paso, Texas. Before the hospital where her mother worked was unionized, Campos said her mother \"had to work two jobs, and we couldn't afford health insurance.\" Campos thinks her summer experience was worthwhile. \"I'm finally doing something instead of just talking,\" she said.\n\n  \nWe the People Making a Difference Gladiola Campos -- Union Summer logo",
