        "text": "Further, the vertices in any component of $T\\setminus\\{k\\}$ are either all positive, all negative, or all zero. It follows that the subgraph of $T$ induced by the zero vertices is connected. The proof of the second part is similar to the one given for (i).\n\n# 8.4 Bounds for Algebraic Connectivity\n\nThe following representation for the second smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix will be used. It is easily derived from the spectral theorem.\n\nLemma 8.15 Let A be a symmetric $n\\times n$ matrix with eigenvalues $\\lambda_{1} \\geq \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\geq \\lambda_{n-1} \\geq \\lambda_{n}$. Let u be an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to $\\lambda_{n}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{n-1}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{{\\frac{x^{\\prime}A x}{x^{\\prime}x}}\\right\\},\n$$\n\nwhere the minimum is taken over all nonzero vectors $x$, orthogonal to $u$.\n\nWe introduce some notation. Let $G$ be a connected graph with $V(G)=\\{1,.\\,.\\,.\\,,n\\}$. If $i,j\\in V(G)$, then as usual the distance between $i$ and $j$, denoted $d(i,j)$, is defined to be the length (that is, the number of edges) in the shortest $(i j)$-path. We set $d(i,i)=0, i=1,.\\,.\\,.\\,,n$. If $V_{1}$, $V_{2}\\subset V(G)$ are nonempty sets, then define\n\n$$\nd(V_{1},V_{2})=\\operatorname*{min}\\{d(i,j):i\\in V_{1},\\,j\\in V_{2}\\}.\n$$\n\nIf $V_{1}=\\{i\\}$, we write $d(V_{1},V_{2})$ as $d(i,V_{2})$.\n\nTheorem 8.16 Let $G$ be a connected graph with $V(G)=\\{1,.\\,.\\,.\\,,n\\}$. Let $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ be nonempty disjoint subsets of $V(G)$, and let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be the subgraphs induced by $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, respectively. Let $L$ be the Laplacian of $G$ and $\\mu$ the algebraic connectivity. Then\n\n$$\n\\mu\\leq\\frac{1}{d(V_{1},V_{2})^{2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{|V_{1}|}+\\frac{1}{|V_{2}|}\\right)(|E(G)|-|E(G_{1})|-|E(G_{2})|).\n$$\n\nProof Let\n\n$$\ng(i)=\\frac{1}{|V_{1}|}-\\frac{1}{d(V_{1},V_{2})}\\left(\\frac{1}{|V_{1}|}+\\frac{1}{|V_{2}|}\\right)\\operatorname*{min}\\{d(i,V_{1}),d(V_{1},V_{2})\\},\n$$\n\n$i=1,\\dots,n$, $i\\in V_{1}$, $\\begin{array}{r}{g(i)=\\frac{1}{|V_{1}|}}\\end{array}$, $i\\in V_{2}$, $g(i)=-\\frac{1}{|V_{2}|}$. Also, if $i\\sim j$, then $|d(i,V_{1})-d(j,V_{2})|\\leq1$ and hence\n\n$$\n|g(i)-g(j)|\\leq{\\frac{1}{d(V_{1},\\,V_{2})}}\\,\\bigg({\\frac{1}{|V_{1}|}}+{\\frac{1}{|V_{2}|}}\\bigg).\n$$",
