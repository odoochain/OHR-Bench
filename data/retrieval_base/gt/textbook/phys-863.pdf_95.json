At lower temperatures, the bilayer is in a $L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ 'gel' phase and there is a transition to 'fluid' phase, $L_{\\alpha}$ at higher temperatures due to an increase in mobility of individual lipids in the bilayer. As the ripple phase $P_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ is observed in hydrated lipid bilayers between the $L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ and $L_{\\alpha}$ phase. This phase is characterized by corrugations of the membrane surface with well-defined periodicity with an axis parallel to the mean bilayer plane [1]. The molecular origin of ripple-phase formation has traditionally been associated with the lipid headgroup region and hence lipids can be classified into ripple-forming and non-ripple forming lipids based on their headgroups. One of the lipid families belonging to the ripple-forming class is phosphatidyl cholines and has been studied in extensive detail [1].  \n\n  \nScheme above shows different physical states adopted by a lipid bilayer in an aqueous medium [2].  \n\n# Thermodynamics and Existence  \n\nThe existence of the ripple phase at first sight is paradoxical on thermodynamic grounds since it involves an apparent lowering of symmetry (from $L_{\\beta},$ to $P_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$) on increasing the temperature. Some models suggest that ripples exist because of periodic local spontaneous curvature in the lipid bilayers formed due to electrostatic coupling between water molecules and the polar headgroups or coupling between membrane curvature and molecular tilt. It has also been speculated that ripples form to relieve packing frustrations that arise whenever the relationship between head-group cross sectional area and cross-sectional area of the apolar tails exceeds a certain threshold [1]. However, there is not one conclusive theory to explain ripple phase formation.  \n\n# Phase Diagram Depicting Ripple Phase  \n\n  \nConcentration (% $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O})$",
