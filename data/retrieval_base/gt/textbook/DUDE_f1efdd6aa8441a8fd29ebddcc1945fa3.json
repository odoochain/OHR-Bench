This guide contains tips and guidelines which should help you get the most out of this experience!\n\nWe hope this role will be useful and enjoyable for you.\n\nWho is Wiki Ambassador?\n\nWiki Ambassador is a student who establishes and strengthens the link between an educational institution and Wikimedia Serbia. You will implement a Wiki-student project at the Faculty in which you are currently studying. This project is based on the idea where students can write seminar papers on Serbian Wikipedia or use another Wiki project in their work. In addition, the task of the Wiki Ambassador is to present Wiki ideas to the academic world and motivate fellow students to participate in the project. In short, the Wiki Ambassadors represent the face of Wikimedia Serbia at their own faculties.\n\nWhat does Wiki Ambassador do?\n\nAs a Wiki Ambassador, you will be able to establish and maintain cooperation between the educational institution and Wikimedia Serbia. You will achieve this by maintaining regular communication with professors and teaching assistants and by arranging lectures and workshops on editing Wikipedia or another Wiki project. Your responsibilities will also include coordinating students work, promoting Wikimedia Serbia and proposing new activities and EDU projects at the educational institution you attend. Communication with other Wiki Ambassadors, sharing your experiences with them and planning common activities can always help you complete your activities successfully.\n\nWhat can you achieve?",

This experience can be very useful for your CV and can help you improve your active listening skills, organizational skills, proactive decision-making and presentation skills. Through various channels of communication, you will learn how to communicate clearly and impartially. In addition, the Wiki Ambassador role will help you in developing a network of contacts that will be useful in your further career.\n\nWhat makes a good Wiki Ambassador?\n\nA good Wiki ambassador must be visible and accessible to all students, which is why you should think about the creative ways to announce your presence at the Faculty and the ways students can get in touch with you. Wikimedia Serbia can always help you with this. Also, you will receive your business cards and email address that can help you in your mission. In addition, each professor will allow you to briefly introduce yourself to the group of students during the class if you ask them. Remember that you will interact with a diverse group of students, so you may want to think about some other ways to ensure that everyone is accessible.\n\nWith whom should you communicate and how?\n\nBefore you begin, you need to be informed about the Wikipedia in schools project and other Wikimedia projects in Serbia. Don't be afraid to talk to others and ask questions. You may find yourself in a situation where these students and professors ask questions about Wikimedia Serbia that are not related to your role. If you don't know what it is about, reply honestly and contact someone at Wikimedia Serbia office so that you can forward the answer later. Wiki ambassador strives to speak clearly and concisely, to listen actively and to be objective and opinionated. It's also important that you check your emails regularly.",

        "text": "What should your workshop look like?\n\nAt the very beginning of planning the workshops, you should know that, depending on the institution, the decision to hold them is made by the specific professors or the Faculty staff. That's why they should be the first instance you would talk to. When organizing a workshop, be sure to pay attention to the space in which the workshop will be held, what the capacity of the classroom is, whether it has sufficient computers and high-speed Internet. In certain situations, you may not be able to keep the workshop as planned due to the interruption of your internet connection or other unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, it would be a good idea to always have a backup plan for your workshop.\n\nAt the beginning of each workshop, the structure of the lecture is presented and explained. Note that most of the writing will be done by students at home, unless the professor has stated otherwise. Do not forget to tell the participants at the beginning of each class to write their first and last name, email address and username on Wikipedia on one piece of paper so that we could have a detailed record of those participants.\n\nThe first part of the workshop should cover a lecture on Wikimedia Serbia and the basic principles of Wikipedia. It is very important that you take a concise approach in this part, otherwise students will lose interest. Also, you should strive to get as much interaction with students as possible.\n\nThe second part of the workshop is designed to be more interactive, because students should, through shorter assignments, learn about the Wiki syntax and try to edit Wikipedia independently. The best ways for students to learn about Wikipedia editing are examples of good and bad articles, which you should prepare before the workshop. This will help students to successfully get informed about Wikipedia editing in their sandboxes and user pages.",

        "text": "To keep students engaged during the workshop, you need to avoid monotonous presentations and do interactive lectures instead, as well as encourage participants to ask questions. Make sure you put as much active work into the workshop and be patient with students and their comments. It is always good to hold workshops in a smaller group, because it is easier to interact with all the participants. For further advice on this, you can contact Educational program manager or one of the Wiki Ambassadors with more experience.\n\nAfter the workshop, it is advisable to leave the students an email address that they can contact if they need help. Also, be sure to present the necessary resources in the form of presentations and brochures.\n\nChosing the topics for the articles\n\nBefore students start writing articles, you need to check if the topics already exist on Wikipedia. You can always suggest they translate Wikipedia articles from other languages, providing these articles do not exist in Serbian Wikipedia. What you need to do is to create a list of students with assigned topics, user accounts and email addresses. You should also do this in consultation with assistants or professors. Google Drive and Spreadsheets are very useful because, unlike a paper list, an online list cannot be lost and can be easily shared with a professor or assistant.\n\nWhat after the workshop?\n\nAfter each workshop, please send students an evaluation questionnaire. You can also send it to the assistant or professor so they can forward it to the students. Google Drive and Google questionnaires are suitable for this. It is very important that you regularly monitor the work of the students and give them advices. If you feel they need extra motivation, you can animate them in many ways, some of them can be certificates, thank you notes, invitations to the other events organized by Wikimedia Serbia, symbolic awards etc. Students are highly motivated by grades, so it might be",

        "text": "a good idea to arrange with the assistants and professors to give them grades or points for the effort, but it is important to determine the criteria for grading.\n\nAfter the articles are submitted, your task will be to continue and establish sustainable cooperation in the coming years, but also to seek to expand cooperation on other faculty subjects and to find and establish cooperation with students who share the values of Wikimedia Serbia.\n\nHow shoud you monitor students' work?\n\nIn order to successfully complete the entry of the articles, it is necessary to use Dashboard tool, where you will create the course page. Each article must include a template for article entries from a particular institution, and it is your job to see if students have put it. If necessary, offer students an additional workshop or meeting, as they may sometimes forget about some things or they simply need a consultation.\n\nChallenges\n\nYou should know that you will often face certain challenges in your work, and one of the first could be starting the communication with a professor and scheduling your first meeting. Because professors are often very busy, it is important to be flexible in scheduling your meeting, but also to have a clear concept of how to encourage a professor to participate in the project. For advice, feel free to contact other Wiki Ambassadors or the Education Program Manager.\n\nOne of the challenges is that the Wikipedia community is not always in the mood for novice mistakes. That is why it is important to be diplomatic and not to get into the conflict with the community, especially with administrators. It is important that you explain this to the students as well. Administrators sometimes place templates on specific articles that indicate what needs to be corrected in the articles. If you are not sure what it means, feel free to contact the administrators.",

        "text": "For the end\n\nFinally, you need to know that Wikimedia Serbia regularly hosts meetings of Wiki Ambassadors that you should attend. In addition, it will be your responsibility to write a report in a specific format after each meeting, workshop or other activity, and to forward it to the Educational Program Manager. Wiki ambassadors also write annual reports. A good Wiki ambassador thinks in advance, so if your studies are nearing the end, think about who might replace you in your Wiki Ambassador role.\n\nWe hope that this short guide will help you understand and successfully carry out the important role of the Wiki Ambassador. We are grateful for the time and effort you will invest in working with us!\n\nAuthor:\n\nNebojša Ratković\nEducation Program Manager\nWikimedia Serbia\nnebojsa.ratkovic@vikimedija.org\n\nProofreading:\n\nMiroslav Loci\nWikimedia Serbia",
