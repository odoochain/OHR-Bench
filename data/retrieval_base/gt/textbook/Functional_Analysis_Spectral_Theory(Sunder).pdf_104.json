        "text": "The inequality 3.4.21 states that $x \\in N_{\\phi}$ if and only if $\\phi(y^{*}x) = 0$ for all $y \\in A$; this implies that $N_{\\phi}$ is a vector subspace of $A$, which is in fact a left-ideal (i.e., $x \\in N_{\\phi} \\implies zx \\in N_{\\phi}$ $\\forall z \\in A$).\n\nDeduce now that the equation  \n\n$$\n\\langle x + N_{\\phi}, y + N_{\\phi} \\rangle = \\phi(y^{\\ast}x)\n$$\n\ndefines a genuine inner product on the quotient space $V = A/N_{\\phi}$. For notational convenience, let us write $\\eta(x) = x + N_{\\phi}$ so that $\\eta: A \\rightarrow V$; since $N_{\\phi}$ is a left-ideal in $A$, it follows that each $x \\in A$ unambiguously defines a linear map $L_{x}: V \\to V$ by the prescription: $L_{x}\\eta(y) = \\eta(xy)$.\n\nWe claim now that each $L_{x}$ is a bounded operator on the inner product space $V$ and that $||L_{x}||_{\\mathcal{L}(V)} \\leq ||x||_{A}$. This amounts to the assertion that  \n\n$$\n\\phi(y^{*}x^{*}xy) = ||L_{x}\\eta(y)||^{2} \\leq ||x||^{2}||\\eta(y)||^{2} = ||x||^{2}\\phi(y^{*}y)\n$$  \n\nfor all $x, y \\in A$. Notice now that, for each fixed $y \\in A$, if we consider the functional $\\psi(z) = \\phi(y^{*}zy)$, then $\\psi$ is a positive linear functional; consequently, we find from Proposition 3.4.11 that $||\\psi|| = \\psi(1) = \\phi(y^{*}y)$; in particular, we find that for arbitrary $x, y \\in A$, we must have $\\phi(y^{*}x^{*}xy) = \\psi(x^{*}x) \\leq ||\\psi|| \\cdot ||x^{*}x||$, in other words, $\\phi(y^{*}x^{*}xy) \\leq ||x||^{2}\\phi(y^{*}y)$, as asserted.\n\nSince $V$ is a genuine inner product space, we may form its completion—call it $\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}$—where we think of $V$ as a dense subspace of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}$. We may deduce from the previous paragraph that each $L_{x}$ extends uniquely to a bounded operator on $\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}$, which we will denote by $\\pi_{\\phi}(x)$; the operator $\\pi_{\\phi}(x)$ is defined by the requirement that $\\pi_{\\phi}(x)\\eta(y) = \\eta(xy)$; this immediately implies that $\\pi_{\\phi}$ is an unital algebra homomorphism of $A$ into $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi})$. To see that $\\pi_{\\phi}$ preserves adjoints, note that if $x, y, z \\in A$ are arbitrary, then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}\n{{\\langle\\pi_{\\phi}(x)\\eta(y), \\eta(z)\\rangle}} &{{=}} &{{\\phi(z^{\\ast}(xy))}}\\\\\n{{\\ }} &{{=}} &{{\\phi((x^{\\ast}z)^{\\ast}y)}}\\\\\n{{\\ }} &{{=}} &{{\\langle\\eta(y), \\pi_{\\phi}(x^{\\ast})\\eta(z)\\rangle,}}\n\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhich implies, in view of the density of $\\eta(A)$ in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}$, that $\\pi_{\\phi}(x)^{*} = \\pi_{\\phi}(x^{*})$, so that $\\pi_{\\phi}$ is indeed a representation of $A$ on $\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}$. Finally, it should be obvious that $\\xi_{\\phi} = \\eta(1)$ is a cyclic vector for this representation.\n\nConversely, if $({\\mathcal{H}}, \\pi, \\xi)$ is another triple which also “works” for $\\phi$ as asserted in the statement of the second half of Theorem 3.4.13, observe that for arbitrary $x, y \\in A$, we have  \n\n$$\n\\langle\\pi(x)\\xi, \\pi(y)\\xi\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}} = \\phi(y^{*}x) = \\langle\\pi_{\\phi}(x)\\xi_{\\phi}, \\pi_{\\phi}(y)\\xi_{\\phi}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}}\n$$  \n\nfor all $x, y \\in A$; the assumptions that $\\xi$ and $\\xi_{\\phi}$ are cyclic vectors for the representations $\\pi$ and $\\pi_{\\phi}$ respectively imply, via Exercise 3.4.12, that there exists a unique unitary operator $U: \\mathcal{H} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}$ with the property that $U(\\pi(x)\\xi) = \\pi_{\\phi}(x)\\xi_{\\phi}$ for all $x \\in A$; it is clear that $U$ has the properties asserted in Theorem 3.4.13.",
