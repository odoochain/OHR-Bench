This competition provides students with an opportunity to gain valuable design experience and showcase their talents to LLNL staff. Students who would like to participate are encouraged to form multidisciplinary teams of 4-6 students and submit their resumes to the MEP office (application details provided later).\n\nSix teams will be selected and each team will be provided with a basic 450-quadcopter drone kit, similar to the kit shown in Figure 1, and a budget to purchase additional parts or materials. The teams will/can then participate in three competitions: Drones winning fastest course time trial, drones able to carry the most weight over the longest distance, and the best design review.\n\nPrizes include:\n\nTrophies\nLLNL T-Shirts and bennies\nGroup tour of LLNL's laser, additive manufacturing and Supercomputers\nCredit towards usage of the AM machines at Cal Poly\n\n\nFigure 1 Example of 450-Quadcopter Kit\nSource: https://pixhawk.org/platforms/multicopters/dji_flamewheel_450",

There are several departments and clubs that offer rapid prototyping services. Details of AM campus resources can be found in Appendix A. All flight tests and the flight competition will be held at the Educational Flight Range.\n\nFaculty \\& Graduate Advisors\n\nAppendix A lists faculty and graduate students who are willing to help teams with technical questions. Please feel free to contact the advisors listed in the Appendix but be respectful of their time and come prepared with questions. Your first resource for the project should always be your team members. The list of faculty will be updated periodically throughout the quarter and the update Appendix can be found in the MEP 24-hour study room. Please do not limit yourself to the advisors listed on the form.\n\nTime Trial Challenge\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of the time trial course is to complete three laps of the course in the fastest time while remaining within the fly zone shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nFigure 2 Time Trial Course",

This includes editing the flight controller software; however, teams cannot replace the flight controller. Additionally, teams must use the real-time operating system (OS) loaded on the Pixhawk Mini or write their own. The team must produce any non-original software. Please note that the ball bearing mechanism for the second challenge does not have to be attached for the time trials.\n\nScoring\n\nEach team will be given three practice laps followed by three timed laps. A penalty of 5 [sec] will be added every time a drone leaves the fly zone during its flight. The team with the lowest total time will receive 12 points, the second lowest will receive 10 points, and so on.\n\nBall Bearing Delivery Course\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of the ball bearing course is to deliver one of six 1 [in] ball bearings to each of the designated target areas shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nFigure 3 Ball Bearing Delivery Course",

Once the drone leaves the start point no more adjustments can be made.\n\nThe bearing release mechanism can be remotely operated.\n\nScoring\n\nTeams will receive 2 points for every bearing successfully delivered and lose 1 points for any bearing dropped outside of the delivery zone. Teams will also lose 1 point for every additional bearing dropped in a delivery zone that already has a ball bearing in it.\n\nAn additional 4 points will be given to teams who automate the bearing release mechanism. In order to receive credit, no commands can be given to the drone after it leaves the start point.\n\nDeliverables\n\nFlight Readiness Review (FRR)\n\nCompleting and approving a Flight Readiness Review is mandatory before flying any UAV. Each team will be required to have a safety lead. This lead and any additional members available will attend a Flight Readiness Review Training.\n\nTeams will present their FRR plan (15-minute presentation) to the FRR board. After receiving feedback, they will make changes to their plan and present their final plan. Once the FRR Board approves the team's plan, they can start flying their aircraft.\n\nConceptual Design Review (CDR)\n\nEach team will conduct a brief CDR with Cal Poly faculty, graduate students, and/or LLNL staff. The purpose of this CDR is to demonstrate that your team understands the assigned problem, has the technical skills necessary to solve the problem, and has a plan to complete the task in a timely manner.\n\nThe format for the CDR will be a 5-10 [min] informal presentation. In the CDR teams should formally define the scope of the project, discuss specific design requirements, list several proposed concepts, and briefly describe their design selection methodology.\n\nPrior to CDR, teams should:\n1. Discuss the purpose of the CDR\n2. Review both challenges and determine specific requirements\n3. Brainstorm several solutions to the problems presented in both challenges\n4. Investigate new materials and fabrication processes\n5. Discuss a plan for performing analysis, manufacturing, and testing\n6. Create a Gantt chart to show your proposed timeline",

Students can create Gantt charts using Microsoft Project which is preloaded on most campus computers.\n\nPreliminary Design Review (PDR)\n\nTeams will present a PDR to Cal Poly faculty, graduate students, and/or LLNL staff. The purpose of this PDR is to justify the selected design and review the analysis performed. Additionally, the results of any testing conducted should be discussed.\n\nThe format of the PDR will be a 20-30 [min] presentation. Please refer to the points rubric listed in Appendix B for scoring information.\n\nTeam Applications\n\nInterested students can independently form teams or contact the MEP office for help finding a team. Once a team is formed, they must submit their team name, resumes and names, majors and emails of each team member to mep@calpoly.edu. MEP will send the teams to LLNL for consideration. Teams must consist of:\n- 4-6 members\n- A minimum of 1 upperclassman\n- Multiple engineering disciplines (for example 2 ME, 2 EE , and 1 CPE )\n- One student must be designated \"safety lead\"\n- At least one student must be affiliated with the Multicultural Engineering Program",
