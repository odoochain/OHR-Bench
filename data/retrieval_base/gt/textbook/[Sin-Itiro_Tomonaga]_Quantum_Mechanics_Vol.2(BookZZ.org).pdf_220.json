(59.12), by the way, is given by  \n\n$$\nP(q)=\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\pi}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\delta}\\exp\\Big\\{-\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}\\,(q\\!-\\!q^{0})^{2}\\Big\\}.\n$$  \n\n(iv) The Uncertainty Relation  \n\nThe two uncertainties $(\\varDelta q$ and $\\varDelta p)$ obtained in the last subsection seem to show a reciprocal relation. Namely, according to Eqs. (59.14) and (59.17), respectively,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\varDelta q=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\delta}}\\\\ {{\\varDelta p=\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\delta\\sqrt{2}}\\,.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThat is, $\\varDelta q$ is proportional to $\\delta$ while $\\varDelta p$ is to $1/\\delta$. Therefore, an effort to reduce $\\varDelta q$ inevitably causes an increase in $\\varDelta p$ and vice versa.  \n\nFrom Eq. (59.20) we find that  \n\n$$\n\\varDelta p\\cdot\\varDelta q={\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\frac{h}{2\\pi}}\\,.\n$$  \n\nIt says, for instance, that $\\varDelta\\phi$ approaches infinity if $\\varDelta q$ tends to 0, and $\\varDelta q$ approaches infinity if $\\varDelta p$ tends to 0. In other words, in a state in which the coordinate has a definite value, the value of momentum is completely indefinite, and in a state in which the momentum has a definite value, the value of coordinate is completely indefinite.  \n\nThe relation (59.21) has been derived from the consideration of a specific wave packet of the form of Eq. (59.12). The question is then, what happens if we take a state other than that chosen here? We give the answer first. For a general $\\psi_{i}$, the relation given in Eq. (59.21) does not necessarily hold, but the product $\\varDelta p \\varDelta q$ never becomes smaller than the value given by Eq. (59.21). We have namely",
