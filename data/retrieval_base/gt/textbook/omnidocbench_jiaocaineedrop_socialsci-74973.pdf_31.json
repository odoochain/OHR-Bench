        "text": "# TeamOne: Julian and Anne\n\nJulian,from Team One,is a white, senior English/Comparative Literature major who had worked in the EWC for two years, including a quarter as an in-class tutor with me. Julian commented minimally on papers and met one-to-one with students at the EWC. He also attended two in-class peer reviews. He has the most experience tutoring one-to-one and in the classroom of all the tutors. Having worked with Julian very closely for two years prior to this study, I found him outspoken and highly intelligent.\n\nAnne is a white, third year TA in English Language and Rhetoric. She had one year of teaching experience with first-years prior to this pairing. She had extensive training and experience, about five years, teaching one-to-one for the EWC and CLUE (CLUE, or the Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment,is another campus student-support service that houses an evening writing center.) She had also presented at several national and regional writing center and Composition and Rhetoric conferences.\n\nTable 2-2.Team One descriptions\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}  \nThe Model & The Tutor & The Instructor \\\\  \nWriting Advisor Tutor Tutor commented on papers and met one-to-one with students at the English Department Writing Center (EWC).

She was planning to pursue K-12 teaching.Like all the EWC tutors(except Sam) she took a five-credit course in writing center theory and practice. Megan considered herself not the strongest writer. During her interview she described how struggling with an English class, from which she eventually earned a 4.0, persuaded her to apply to the EWC.Having worked with her an entire summer, to me Megan always seemed very nice (often \"bubbly\") and approachable.\n\nLaura is a second year TA and Chinese International student, focusing on postcolonial studies and Asian-American literature.She had one year of teaching experience with first-years prior to this pairing.\n\nTable 2-3: Team Two descriptions\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}  \nThe Model & The Tutor & The Instructor \\\\  \nIn-Class Tutor Tutor attended class every day and worked one-to-one with . students at the English Department Writing Center (EWC). & Megan is a white, senior Communications/ English major with two years tutoring in the EWC.

Madeleine is an African-American sophomore English (creative writing) major who had worked for the IC only one quarter prior to this pairing. She enjoys performing spoken-word poetry. She did not receive any formal training in one-to-one teaching prior to this pairing.She attended a college prep high school and participated in running start.Prior to this study, I was not familiar with the personality or tutoring patterns of Madeleine.\n\nSydney,a woman of color (African-American)herself,is a second year TA studying nineteenth-and twentieth-century AfricanAmerican literature. She had about five years of teaching and tutoring experience with high school students and one year of teaching with first-years prior to this pairing.On her wish-list, Sydney had written me a note asking, if at all possible, for a tutor of color.Serendipity worked in her favor in the form of Madeleine,whom I would later learn was the only IC tutor willing to participate in this study.\n\nTable 2-4: Team Three descriptions\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}  \nThe Model & The Tutor & The Instructor \\\\  \n & & \\\\  \n\\end{tabular}",
