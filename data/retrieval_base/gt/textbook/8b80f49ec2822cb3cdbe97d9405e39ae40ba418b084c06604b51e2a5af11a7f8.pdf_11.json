(A) Consistent with the Window Masker results, more 13-mers are found to be repeated (present at a higher frequency) on the D. mojavensis F element (dark blue line) than the other analysis regions. The genomic sequence in each analysis region is partitioned into overlapping 13-mers and the frequency of each 13-mer is tabulated using Tallymer. The values on the x-axis correspond to the number of times that a particular 13-mer is found in the analysis region, whereas the y-axis corresponds to the total number of 13-mers (of all sequences) that appear at each frequency. For example, approximately $10^{6}$ 13-mers appear only once in each analysis region. (B) Cumulative dinucleotide repeats analysis shows a higher frequency of dinucleotide repeats on the D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi F elements (dark blue and purple lines, respectively) than on the D. melanogaster and D. erecta F elements (dark red and orange lines, respectively). A pseudocount of one has been added to the cumulative distribution plots in order to show a continuous distribution in the semi-log plot.\n\ncandidate is shown in Figure S5. (See File S1 for a more detailed description of this analysis.)  \n\nOverall repeat distribution on the F element: Collectively, the repeat analysis shows the F elements have a higher repeat density than the euchromatic reference regions in all four Drosophila species. It also shows that although the D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi F elements have similar total repeat densities, they have strikingly different repeat compositions. A total of $75\\%$ of the repeats that overlap with a repeat identified by WindowMasker on the D. mojavensis F element are transposons (particularly DINE-1 elements) compared to only $27\\%$ on the D. grimshawi F element, whereas the D. grimshawi F element shows a greater density of simple and low complexity repeats than the D. mojavensis F element $39\\%$ vs. $20\\%$ These differences in repeat composition could impact the local chromatin structure and thus the evolution of the resident genes.  \n\n# Evolution of F element genes  \n\nDespite its high repeat density, the distal arm of the D. melanogaster F element contains 79 genes, many of which have important developmental and housekeeping functions (Riddle et al. 2012). Our manual gene annotations (described previously) show that the D. melanogaster, D. erecta, D. mojavensis, and D. grimshawi F elements all have approximately 80 genes. The gene density of the F element is lower than that of the euchromatic reference regions from the D element ($\\sim$60 genes/Mb vs. $\\sim$80 genes/Mb) for these four species (Table S6). Among the four species, the D. mojavensis F element has the lowest gene density (48 genes/Mb compared with 60-66 genes/Mb in the other F elements). This reflects the increased size of the D. mojavensis F element due to the expansion of repetitious elements (1.7 Mb vs. 1.2-1.3 Mb in the other F elements) (Table S6 and Figure 3).  \n\nAlthough we have produced annotations for all isoforms, our analysis below is based only on the isoform with the largest coding region (i.e., the most comprehensive isoform) for each gene. Restricting our analysis to the most comprehensive isoform allows us to avoid counting the same region multiple times because of alternative splicing. We initially examined genes at the base, extended, and telomeric regions (described previously) of the D. erecta D element. Since the genes in these three euchromatic regions exhibit similar characteristics, the primary focus of the following analysis is on the comparison of genes between the F element and the base of the D element (results for all of the analysis regions are available in Figure S6). Summary statistics for all of the gene characteristics, and results of multiple comparison tests after the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) rank sum tests (Kruskal and Wallis 1952), are available in File S6.  \n\nF element genes are larger because they have larger introns and more coding exons: Comparisons of the distribution of gene characteristics using violin plots (Hintze and Nelson 1998) show that the coding span (i.e., the region that spans from the start codon to the stop codon, including introns) for F element genes is much larger (median 5156-7569 bp) than for genes at the base of the D elements (median 1028-1736 bp) (Figure 5, top left). The KW test shows that this difference is statistically significant (p-value: 2.12E-48).  \n\nPart of this difference in the coding span can be attributed to the significantly higher transposon density (KW test p-value: 2.40E-82) within the introns of F element genes (Figure 5, top center; “repeat size is the total size of the transposon fragments within the introns of a gene, in bp). Among the four species analyzed in this study, $71–83\\%$ of the F element genes contain at least one transposon fragment in an intron. In contrast, only $20–46\\%$ of the D element genes contain at least one transposon fragment. Consistent with the results of the",
