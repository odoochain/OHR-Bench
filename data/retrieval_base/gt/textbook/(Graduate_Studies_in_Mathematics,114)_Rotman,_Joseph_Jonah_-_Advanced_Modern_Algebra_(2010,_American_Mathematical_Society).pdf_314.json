If $I$ is a proper ideal in a commutative ring $R$ , then there is an inclusion-preserving bijection $\\varphi$ from the set of all ideals $J$ in $R$ containing $I$ to the set of all ideals in $R/I$, given by\n\n$$\n\\varphi\\colon J\\mapsto J/I=\\{a+I\\colon a\\in J\\}.\n$$\n\nProof. If we forget its multiplication, the commutative ring $R$ is merely an additive abelian group and its ideal $I$ is a (normal) subgroup. The Correspondence Theorem for Groups, Theorem 1.82, now applies to the natural map $\\pi\\colon R\\to R/I$ , and it gives an inclusion-preserving bijection\n\n$\\Phi$ : {all subgroups of $R$ containing $I$ } $\\to$ {all subgroups of $R/I$}\n\nwhere $\\Phi(J)=\\pi(J)=J/I$\n\nIf $J$ is an ideal, then $\\Phi(J)$ is also an ideal, for if $r\\in R$ and $a\\in J$, then $r a\\in J$ and\n\n$$\n(r+I)(a+I)=r a+I\\in J/I.\n$$\n\nLet $\\varphi$ be the restriction of $\\Phi$ to the set of intermediate ideals; $\\varphi$ is an injection because $\\Phi$ is an injection. To see that $\\varphi$ is surjective, let $J^{*}$ be an ideal in $R/I$. Now $\\pi^{-1}(J^{*})$ is an intermediate ideal in $R$ , for it contains $I\\,=\\,\\pi^{-1}((0))$ , and $\\varphi(\\pi^{-1}(J^{*}))=\\pi(\\pi^{-1}(J^{*}))=J^{*}$.$^1$\n\n  \nFigure 5.1. Correspondence Theorem.\n\nUsually, the Correspondence Theorem for Rings is invoked, tacitly, by saying that every ideal in the quotient ring $R/I$ has the form $J/I$ for some unique ideal $J$ with $I\\subseteq J\\subseteq R$\n\nExample 5.2. Let $I=(m)$ be a nonzero ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$. If $J$ is an ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$ containing $I$ , then $J=\\left(a\\right)$ for some $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ (because $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID). Since $(m)\\subseteq(a)$ if and only if $a\\mid m$ , the Correspondence Theorem for Rings shows that every ideal in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/I=\\mathbb{I}_{m}$ has the form $J/I=\\left([a]\\right)$ for some divisor $a$ of $m$.\n\nDefinition. An ideal $I$ in a commutative ring $R$ is called a prime ideal if it is a proper ideal, that is, $I\\neq R,$ and $a b\\in I$ implies that $a\\in I$ or $b\\in I$\n\n# Example 5.3.\n\n(i) The ideal $(0)$ is a prime ideal in a ring $R$ if and only if $R$ is a domain.",
