As in the chordal case, we are in fact going to focus on the conformal geometry of the complement  $H_{t}$  of  $K_{t}$  in the unit disk  $\\mathbb{U}$. One first has to find a natural time-parametrization. It turns out to be convenient to define the conformal map  $g_{t}$  from  $H_{t}$  onto  $\\mathbb{U}$  that is normalised by  \n\n$$\ng_{t}(0) = 0 \\ \\mathrm{and} \\ g_{t}^{\\prime}(0) > 0.\n$$  \n\nNote that  $g_{t}^{\\prime}(0) \\geq 1$. This can be, for instance, derived using the fact that  $\\log g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)$  is the limit when  $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$  of  $\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$  times the probability that a planar Brownian motion started from  $\\varepsilon$  hits the circle of radius  $\\varepsilon^{2}$  before exiting  $H_{t}$  (an analyst would find this justification very strange, for sure).  \n\nThen (and this is simply because, with obvious notation,  $(\\widetilde{g}_{s} \\circ g_{t})(0) = \\widetilde{g}_{s}(0) \\circ g_{t}^{\\prime}(0))$, one measures the “size”  $a(K_{t})$  of  $K_{t}$  via the derivative of  $g_{t}$  at the origin:  \n\n$$\ng_{t}^{\\prime}(0) = \\exp(a(t)).\n$$  \n\nHence, we will consider growing families of compact sets such that  $a(K_{t}) = t$.  \n\nSuppose now that  $(\\zeta_{t}, t \\geq 0)$  is a continuous function on the unit circle  $\\mathcal{O}\\mathbb{U}$. Define for all  $z \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{U}}$, the solution  $g_{t}(z)$  to the ODE  \n\n$$\n\\partial_{t}g_{t}(z) = -g_{t}(z) \\frac{g_{t}(z) + \\zeta_{t}}{g_{t}(z) - \\zeta_{t}}\n$$  \n\nsuch that  $g_{0}(z) = z$. This solution is well-defined up to the (possibly infinite) time  $T(z)$  defined by  \n\n$$\nT(z) = \\operatorname*{sup}\\{t > 0 : \\operatorname*{min}_{s \\in [0, t]} |g_{s}(z) - \\zeta_{s}| > 0\\}.\n$$  \n\nWe then define  \n\n$$\nK_{t} := \\{z \\in \\mathbb{U} : T(z) \\leq t\\}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nU_{t} := \\mathbb{U} \\setminus K_{t}.\n$$  \n\nThe family  $(K_{t}, t \\ge 0)$  is called the (radial) Loewner chain associated to the driving function  $\\zeta^{-}$.  \n\nThe general statements that we described in the chordal case are also valid in this radial case. One can add one feature that has no analog in the chordal case: It is possible to estimate the Euclidean distance  $d_{t}$  from 0 to  $K_{t}$  in terms of  $a(t) = t$. Indeed, since  $U_{t}$  contains the disc  $d_{t} \\times \\mathbb{U}$, it is clear that  $g_{t}^{\\prime}(0) \\leq 1/d_{t}$. On the other hand, a classical result of the theory of",
