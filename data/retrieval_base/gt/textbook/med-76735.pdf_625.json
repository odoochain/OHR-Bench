A sample PES statement is, \"Impaired Religiosity related to environmental barriers to practicing religion as evidenced by difficulty adhering to prescribed religious beliefs.\" The nurse could contact the patient's pastor to arrange a visitor or determine if services can be viewed online.  \n\n# Spiritual Distress  \n\nEvents that place patient populations at risk for developing spiritual distress include birth of a child, death of a significant other, exposure to death, a significant life transition, severe illness or injury, exposure to natural disaster, racial conflict, or an unexpected event.",
