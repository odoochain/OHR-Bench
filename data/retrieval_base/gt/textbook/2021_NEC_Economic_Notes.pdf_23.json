        "text": "Contraction - real GDP begins to fall. If there is a contraction for more than two quarters, there is a recession. Real GDP falls and unemployment increases. Price levels slow and may fall down.  \n\nTrough - cycle's minimum real GDP, end of contraction. Wide spread unemployment followed by expansion (recovery).  \n\nSometimes called economic fluctuations because they are not predictable.  \n\n# #TRENDS  \n\nLong-term growth trend - the straight line that shows how output grows when the fluctuations are removed. The output is known as the potential output.  \n\nUnemployment falls when real GDP grows (expansion). Firms hire more labor and increase quantity of output.  \n\nUnemployment increases when real GDP falls (contraction). Firms cut production and have to fire some workers.  \n\nWhen an economy experiences full employment, there is still a natural rate of unemployment.  \n\nIf actual GDP $>$ potential GDP, unemployment is lower than the natural rate. If potential GDP $>$ actual GDP, unemployment is greater than the natural rate.  \n\nThere is a GDP (output) gap if the actual GDP is above/below the potential GDP.  \n\n# REASONS TO STUDY CYCLE  \n\nReal output growth means that there's a chance to have higher standards of living.  \n\nLarge fluctuations are not desirable, because with expansion, inflation could happen and with a contraction, unemployment increases.  \n\nSome key macroeconomic objectives: rapid economic growth, full employment, and price stability.",
