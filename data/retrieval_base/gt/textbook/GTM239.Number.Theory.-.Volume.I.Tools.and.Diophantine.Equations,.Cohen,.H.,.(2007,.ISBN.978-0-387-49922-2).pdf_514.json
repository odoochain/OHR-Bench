        "text": "Lemma 7.3.8. Assume that $g(T)$ is not equal to a constant times the square of a rational function, and let $P \\in E_{g}(K)$. The following are equivalent:\n\n(1) $h(P) = 0$\n\n(2) $P \\in E_{g}(k)$\n\n(3) Either $P = \\mathcal{O}$ or there exists $u \\in k$ such that $P = (u, 0)$\n\n(4) For all $Q \\in E_{g}(K)$ we have $h(P+Q)=h(Q)$; in other words, $B(P,Q) = 0$.\n\nProof. Since the result is trivial when $P = \\mathcal{O}$, assume that this is not the case and write as usual $P = (X_{P}, Y_{P})$. Clearly $h(P) = 0$ if and only if $X_{P} \\in k$, so we can write $X_{P} = u$. We thus have $g(T)Y_{P}^{2} = f(u)$, so that if $f(u) \\neq 0$, $g(T)$ is equal to a constant times the square of the rational function $1/Y_{P}$, contrary to our assumption. Thus $f(u) = 0$, so $Y_{P} = 0$ and $P = (u, 0)$, proving that (1) implies (3), and (3) implies (2) implies (1) is trivial, so that (1), (2), and (3) are equivalent. To prove that (3) implies (4), we note that if $Q = \\pm P$, we have $h(2P) = 4h(P) = 0$ and $h(P-P) = 0$; so (4) is clear, and (4) is also clear if $Q = \\mathcal{O}$. Otherwise, a simple computation using the addition law gives $X_{P+Q} = u + f^{\\prime}(u)/(X_{Q}-u)$, and since $f(u) = 0$ we have $f^{\\prime}(u) \\neq 0$, and this is easily seen to imply that $h(P+Q) = h(Q)$ as desired. Finally, (4) applied to $Q = k P$ for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ gives $(k+1)^{2}h(P) = h(P+Q) = h(Q) = k^{2}h(P)$; hence $h(P) = 0$, so (4) implies (1).\n\n# 7.3.4 Elliptic Curves over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$\n\nWe begin with the following very easy lemma.\n\nLemma 7.3.9. Let $q$ be an odd prime power, let $\\rho$ be the unique multiplicative character of order 2 on $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, and let $y^{2} = f(x)$ be the equation of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $f(X)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Then $|E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})| = q+1-a_{q}$ with $a_{q} = -\\sum_{x\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}} \\rho(f(x))$. In particular, if $q = p$ is prime, we have $|E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})| = p+1-a_{p}$ with\n\n$$\na_{p} = -\\sum_{x\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}}\\left({\\frac{f(x)}{p}}\\right).\n$$\n\nProof. For a given $X \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ it is clear that the number of $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ such that $y^{2} = X$ is equal to $1 + \\rho(X)$. Counting the point at infinity separately, it follows that\n\n$$\n|E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})| = 1 + \\sum_{x\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(1 + \\rho(f(x))\\right) = q + 1 + \\sum_{x\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\rho(f(x)),\n$$\n\nproving the lemma.\n\nThe main result for curves over finite fields is Hasse's theorem giving precise bounds on the cardinality of $E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})$.
