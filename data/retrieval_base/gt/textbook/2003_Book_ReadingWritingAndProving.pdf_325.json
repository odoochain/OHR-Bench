This algorithm is in the seventh book of Euclid's Elements, but was likely known earlier.  \n\nThere are two trivial cases that must be considered before moving to the interesting one. If $m = n$, then the greatest common divisor is obviously |m|. If one of the integers is zero (remember that both can't be zero), then the greatest common divisor is the absolute value of the non-zero integer. Now for the main case, note that the positive divisors of an integer m are the same as the ones of -m. For this reason, we may assume that both m and $n$ are positive. After possible relabelling of the two numbers, we may further assume that $m > n > 0$.  \n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a repeated application of the division algorithm, Theorem 25.3. Each line is obtained from the previous one by shifting the divisor to the spot previously occupied by the dividend, and the remainder to the spot previously occupied by the divisor. It's easier to see than to say. Here is the way to see it:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{m}&{=}&{q_{1}n+r_{1},}\\\\ {n}&{=}&{q_{2}r_{1}+r_{2},}\\\\ {r_{1}}&{=}&{q_{3}r_{2}+r_{3},}\\\\ {\\cdots}&{}&\\\\ {r_{k-3}}&{=}&{q_{k-1}r_{k-2}+r_{k-1},}\\\\ {r_{k-2}}&{=}&{q_{k}r_{k-1}+r_{k},}\\\\ {r_{k-1}}&{=}&{q_{k+1}r_{k}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy the division algorithm, the remainders satisfy the inequalities $n > r_{1} > \\ldots > r_{i} > r_{i+1} > \\ldots > 0$. This guarantees that the algorithm comes to a halt after finitely many steps. We label the last non-zero remainder $r_{k}$ and solve for $r_{k}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{r_{k}}&{=}&{r_{k-2}-q_{k}r_{k-1}}\\\\ &{=}&{r_{k-2}-q_{k}(r_{k-3}-q_{k-1}r_{k-2})\\,\\,\\,\\,=}&{-q_{k}r_{k-3}+(1+q_{k}q_{k-1})r_{k-2}}\\\\ &&{\\,\\,\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot}\\\\ &{=}&{x_{0}m+y_{0}n}\\end{array}\n$$",
