Exercises\n\n(1) Let $E$ be a complex vector bundle over $S^{4k}$. Give a formula for the Pontrjagin class $p_{k}(E)$ in terms of $c_{2k}(E)$.\n\n(2) Let $E$ be a $2k$-dimensional oriented vector bundle. Prove that $p_{k}(E)=e(E)\\smile e(E)$.\n\n(3) Let $E$ be a not necessarily oriented $2k$-dimensional vector bundle. Prove that the class represented by $p_{k}(E)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$-cohomology is equal to $w_{2k}(E)\\smile w_{2k}(E)$. \n\n(4) Prove that $\\langle p_{k}(E),[S^{4k}]\\rangle$ is even for all vector bundles $E$ over $S^{4k}$. You can use (or better prove it as an application of Sard's theorem) that an $r$-dimensional vector bundle over $S^{n}$ with $r\\ >\\ n$ is isomorphic to $F\\oplus(S^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{r-n})$ for some $\\mathit{n}$-dimensional vector bundle $F$.",
