Now if $2/n$ is less than the smallest nonzero $t_{i}$, $x$, $x_{n}$, $\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}H$, $P\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}(H)$, $=P_{n}\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}(H)$, $P_{n}\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}\\Rightarrow P\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}$, $R^{k}$ for each $t_{1},\\cdots,t_{k}$. On the other hand, the set $\\{y:|y(t)|\\,\\leq\\,1/2,0\\,\\leqq t\\leqq1\\}$, the sphere of radius $1/2$ about $\\mathbf{x}$, is a $P$ -continuity set and $P_{n}(A)=1$ does not converge to $P(A)=0$. Thus $P_{n}$ does not converge weakly to $P$.\n\nThis example shows that if there is convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions, that is, if\n\n$$\nP_{n}\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}\\Rightarrow P\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}\n$$\n\nfor all $k$ and $t_{1},\\cdots,t_{k}$, it does not follow that there is weak convergence of $P_{n}$ to $P$.\n\n$$\nP_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{\\cdot}\n$$\n\n(The converse proposition of course does hold because of Corollary 2 to Theorem 3.3.) Thus weak convergence in $c$ involves considerations going beyond finite dimensional ones, which is why it is useful (see the introduction).\n\nOn the other hand, (5.1) does imply (5.2) in the presence of relative compactness.\n\nTHEOREM 5.1. If (5.1) holds for all $k$ and $t_{1},\\dots,t_{k}$ and if $\\left\\{{{\\cal P}}_{n}\\right\\}$ is relatively compact, then (5.2) holds.\n\nProof. Since $\\{P_{n}\\}$ is relatively compact, each subsequence $\\{P_{n_{i}}\\}$ contains a $\\{P_{n_{i_{m}}}\\}$ such that $P_{n_{i_{m}}}\\Rightarrow Q$ as $m\\to\\infty$. For each $Q$ in $C$, $P_{n_{i_{m}}}\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}\\Rightarrow\\hat{Q\\pi}_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}$, and $Q\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}$ is $\\mathbf{\\alpha}=P\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}$. Since $P$ and $Q$ are equal as observed above, this implies $P=Q$. Thus each subsequence of $\\{P_{n}\\}$ contains a further subsequence converging weakly to $P$, and (5.2) follows by Theorem 2.2.\n\nTheorem 4.1 characterizes relative compactness by tightness. In order to apply Theorem 5.1 in concrete cases, we shall in turn characterize tightness by means of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.\n\nFor $x\\in C$ and $\\delta>0$ the modulus of continuity is defined by\n\n$$\nw_{x}(\\delta)=\\operatorname*{sup}\\{|x(s)-x(t)|\\,{:}0\\leq s,t\\leq1,|s-t|<\\delta\\}\\,.\n$$\n\nAccording to the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, a set $A$ in $c$ has compact closure if and only if\n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{sup}_{x\\in C}\\lvert x(0)\\rvert<\\infty\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\delta\\to0}\\ \\operatorname*{sup}_{x\\in C}\\ w_{x}(\\delta)=0.\n$$\n\nTHEOREM 5.2. A family $\\Pi$ of probability measures on $c$ is tight (hence relatively compact) if and only if, for each $\\eta$, there exists an $a$ such that\n\n$$\nP\\{x\\!:\\!|x(0)|\\,>\\,a\\}\\,<\\eta\\,,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ P\\in\\Pi\\,,\n$$",
