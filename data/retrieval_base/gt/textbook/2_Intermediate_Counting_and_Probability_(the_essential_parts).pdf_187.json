We can add this 1 to our example, though, without any difficulty. If there are 0 stairs, then there's only 1 way to climb this staircase: do nothing! So $f(0) = 1$ makes sense. Also note that $f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2,$ so that our equation $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$ holds for all positive integers $n \\geq 2$.\n\nWhen we add this first 1 to our sequence, we get the sequence that we first saw at the start of the chapter:\n\n$$\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThese numbers are called the Fibonacci numbers, in honor of the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, whose nickname was \"Fibonacci,\" and who first published the sequence of numbers in his Liber abaci in 1202.\n\nWe've seen that each Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. We can write this using a more formal definition.\n\nWe typically denote sequences using a variable with a subscript, such as\n\n$$\na_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\dotsc.\n$$\n\nThus, $a_{1}$ is the first number in the sequence, $a_{2}$ is the second number in the sequence, and so on. Sometimes we'll start our lists with $a_{0}$ instead of $a_{1},$ so that our sequence would be\n\n$$\na_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots.\n$$\n\nThe Fibonacci numbers are defined by $F_{1} = 1, F_{2} = 1,$ and $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for all positive integers $n > 2.$ So, for example,",
