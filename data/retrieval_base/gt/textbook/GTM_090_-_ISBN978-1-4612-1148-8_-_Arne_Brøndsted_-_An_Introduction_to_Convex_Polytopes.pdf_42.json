        "text": "To prove $(b)\\Rightarrow(a)$, it suffices to show that  \n\n$$\nC\\in\\operatorname{conv}(\\operatorname{ext}\\,C).\n$$\n\n(In fact, suppose that (4) holds. Since the opposite inclusion of (4) is obvious, it then follows that $C={\\mathrm{conv}}({\\mathrm{ext}}\\ C)$. But then we also have $C={\\mathrm{conv}}\\ M$ for any subset $M$ of $C$ containing ext $C$.) We shall prove (4) by induction on the dimension of $C$. For dim $C=-1,0$, there is nothing to prove. For dim $C=1$, the statement is clearly valid. Suppose that the statement is valid for all compact convex sets of dimension $<e$, where $e\\geq2$, and let $C$ be a compact convex set of dimension $e$. Let $x$ be any point in $C$; we shall prove that $x$ is a convex combination of extreme points of $C$, cf. Theorem 2.2. If $x$ itself is an extreme point, there is nothing to prove. If $x$ is not an extreme point, then there is a segment in $C$ having $x$ in its relative interior. Extending the segment, if necessary, we see that there are in fact points $y_{0},y_{1}\\in\\mathrm{rb}\\;C$ such that $x\\in\\;]y_{0},y_{1}[$. Let $F_{0}$ and $F_{1}$ be the smallest faces of $C$ containing $y_{0}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively. Then $F_{0}$ and $F_{1}$ are proper faces of $C$, cf. Corollary 5.7. They are, in particular, compact convex sets, cf. Theorem 5.1, and they both have dimension $<e$, cf. Corollary 5.5. Then, by the induction hypothesis, there are points $x_{0\\,1},\\dots,x_{0\\,p}\\in\\,\\mathrm{ext}\\,F_{0}$ and $x_{11},\\dots,x_{1q}\\in\\,\\mathrm{ext}\\,F_{\\mathrm{1}}$ such that $y_{0}$ is a convex combination of the $x_{0i}$'s and $y_{1}$ is a convex combination of the $x_{1j}$'s. Since $x$ is a convex combination of $y_{0}$ and $y_{1}$, it follows that $x$ is a convex combination of the $x_{0i}$'s and $x_{1j}$'s. To complete the proof, we note that the $x_{0i}$'s and $x_{1j}$'s are in fact extreme points of $C$; this follows from Theorem 5.2.\n\nCorollary 5.11. Let $C$ be a compact convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with $\\mathrm{dim}\\;C=n$. Then each point of $C$ is a convex combination of at most $n+1$ extreme points of $C$.\n\nProof. Combine Theorem 5.10(c) and Corollary 2.4.  \n\n# EXERCISES  \n\n5.1. Show that ext $C$ is closed when $C$ is a 2-dimensional compact convex set.\n\n5.2.

Let $C$ be a closed convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Show that if a convex subset $F$ of $C$ is a face of $C$, then $C\\backslash F$ is convex. Show that the converse does not hold in general.  \n\n5.4. Let $C$ be a non-empty closed convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. An affine subspace $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is said to support $C$ if $A\\cap C\\neq\\emptyset$ and $C\\backslash A$ is convex. Show that the supporting hyperplanes of $C$ in the sense of Section 4 are the hyperplanes that support $C$ in the sense just mentioned.",
