        "text": "infinite sequence. Now we just need a systematic way to put all the elements $a_{i j}$ into a sequence. We do this by listing first all the elements $a_{i j}$ in which $i+j=2$ (there is only one such pair, $(1,1)$), then all the elements in which $i+j=3$ (there are only two such pairs, $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$), and so on; except that we do not list any element that we have already listed. So, assuming that these elements are distinct, our list starts $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, $a_{21}$, $a_{13}$, $a_{22}$, $a_{31}$, $a_{14}$, .... (If any of these terms duplicates a previous term, then it is simply omitted.) The result of this process will be either an infinite sequence or a finite sequence containing all the elements of the union of the sets $A_{\\imath}$. Thus, that union is countable.\n\n29. There are only a finite number of bit strings of each finite length, so we can list all the bit strings by listing first those of length 0, then those of length 1, etc. The listing might be $\\lambda, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, \\ldots.$ (Recall that $\\lambda$ denotes the empty string.) Actually, this is a special case of Exercise 27: the set of all bit strings is the union of a countable number of countable (actually finite) sets, namely the sets of bit strings of length $n$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$\n\n30. A little experimentation with this function shows the pattern:\n\nf(1,1) = 1 f(2,1) = 3 f(3,1) = 6 f(4,1) = 10 f(5,1) = 15 f(6,1) = 21 f(1,2) = 2 f(2,2) = 5 f(3,2) = 9 f(4,2) = 14 f(5,2) = 20 f(6,2) = 27 f(1,3) = 4 f(2,3) = 8 f(3,3) = 13 f(4,3) = 19 f(5,3) = 26 f(1,4) = 7 f(2,4) = 12 f(3,4) = 18 f(4,4) = 25 f(1,5) = 11 f(2,5) = 17 f(3,5) = 24 f(1,6) = 16 f(2,6) = 23 f(1,7) = 22\n\nWe see by looking at the diagonals of this table that the function takes on successive values as $m+n$ increases. When $m+n=2$, $f(m,n)=1$. When $m+n=3$, $f(m,n)$ takes on the values 2 and 3. When $m+n=4$, $f(m,n)$ takes on the values 4, 5, and 6. And so on. It is clear from the formula that the range of values the $m+n$ $m+n=x$ $\\textstyle{\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+1$ $\\textstyle{\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+(x-1)$ since $m$ can assume the values $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, (x-1)$ under these conditions, and the first term in the formula is a fixed positive integer when $m+n$ is fixed. To show that this function is one-to-one and onto, we merely need to show that the range of values for $x+1$ picks up precisely where the range of values for $\\mathbf{x}$ left off, i.e., that $f(x-1,1)+1=f(1,x)$. We compute:\n\n$$\nf(x-1,1)+1={\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+(x-1)+1={\\frac{x^{2}-x+2}{2}}={\\frac{(x-1)x}{2}}+1=f(1,x)\n$$\n\n33. It suffices to find one-to-one functions $f:(0,1)\\to[0,1]$ and $g:[0,1]\\,\\longrightarrow\\,(0,1)$. We can obviously use the function $f(x)=x$ in the first case. For the second, we can just compress $[0, 1]$ into, say, $[\\frac{1}{3},\\,\\frac{2}{3}]$; the increasing linear function $g(x)\\,=\\,(x+1)/3$ will do that. It then follows from the Schroder-Bernstein theorem that $|(0,1)|=|[0,1]|$.\n\n34. We can follow the hint or argue as follows, which really amounts to the same thing. (See the answer key for a proof using bit strings.) Suppose there were such a one-to-one correspondence $f$ from $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ to the power set of $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ (the set of all subsets of $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$). Thus, for each $x\\in\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$, $f(x)$ is a subset of $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$. We will derive a contradiction by showing that $f$ is not onto; we do this by finding an element not in its range. To this end, let $A\\,=\\,\\{\\,x\\,\\mid\\,x\\,\\not\\in\\,f(x)\\,\\}\\,,$ We claim that $A$ is not in the range of $f$. If it were, then $A\\,=\\,f(x_{0})$ for some $x_{0}\\in\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$. Let us look at whether $x_{0}\\in A$ or not. On the one hand, if $x_{0}\\in A$, then by the definition of $A$ it must be true that $x_{0}\\notin f(x_{0})$, which means that $x_{0}\\notin A$; that is a contradiction. On the other hand, if $x_{0}\\notin A$, then by the definition of $A$, it must be true that $x_{0}\\in f(x_{0})$, which means that $x_{0}\\in A$, again a contradiction. Therefore, no such one-to-one correspondence exists.",
