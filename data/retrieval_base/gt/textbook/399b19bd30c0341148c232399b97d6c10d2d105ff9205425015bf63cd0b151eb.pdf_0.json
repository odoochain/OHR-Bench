Greer\n\n# BACKGROUND  \n\nTo survive, trees must complete multiple tasks, which can be optimized for. The closer a tree is to being optimized for a task, the better it does that task, but the more risk it takes on. A species optimization is determined by how well it fits a corresponding model.\n\n- Hydraulic efficiency is predicted by Murray's Law, which is based off area being conserved at branching points.\n- Structural support of limbs is predicted by the Uniform Stress Model (USM). Over optimization (ratio $>1$) puts branches at risk of breaking, so a safety margin must be kept. \n- Total size is optimized under the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) Model, if over optimized trees are more susceptible to wind.\n\nThese models have previously been used with destructive methods, we aim to develop a photographic based methodology, that can still produce precise and accurate enough data to distinguish between models and species.\n\n# METHODS\n\n- DB Hand scaled photos of the entire tree and first node were taken for 30 Ginkgo.\n- Tree height, mother diameter, daughter diameter, and angle between branches of the basal node were measured using Image J (NIH). \n- For each model, a regression compared observed data for mother and daughter attributes, and predicted values were generated using residuals from the observed data regression. An ANCOVA compared slope and y-intercept of the observed regression and the predicted.\n\n\nFigure 1. Full tree image for a Ginkgo\n\n\nFigure 2. Node 1 image for a Ginkgo\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

(Fig. 4)\n- Ginkgo best fit Murray's Law and USM, respectively. (Fig. 5) Thus, Ginkgo is best optimized for hydraulic efficiency and structural support, at the cost of total mass.\n- We do not know why Ginkgo keeps such a large safety margin for total mass. One hypothesis is that because Ginkgo was mostly found in cities, where it does not have nearby trees to compete with, reducing pressure to be tall. Lack of neighbors also means Ginkgo are more exposed to the wind.\n- The photographic data we gathered provided usable data that highlighted even small deviations from the models and differences between species.\n\n# BOTTOM LINE  \n\nAs a proof of concept that photographs can yield usable data, our experiments were a success. It is also clear that different species optimize for different tasks, and that for Ginkgo biloba, minimizing the risk of buckling in the wind is important.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. ANCOVA for WBE model, the slopes of observed and predicted differed statistically significantly. Observed Ginkgo differed from models' predictions most in its optimization for total mass.\n\n  \n\nFigure 5. Comparison of how well Sugar Maple, American Beech, and Gingko fit each model. Ginkgo has a large safety margin to reduce risk of buckling, because of its under optimization for total mass.",
