Since $\\mathcal{N}$ is sequentially closed in the weak operator topology and $\\operatorname{lim}c_{n}$ is in $W$, it follows that $\\operatorname*{lim}w_{n}$ is in $W$. So $W$ is $\\sigma$ -closed in $A^{\\prime\\prime}$. Also, by Lemma 5.4.3,\n\n$$\nk(\\operatorname*{lim}w_{n})=k(\\operatorname*{lim}c_{n})=c=\\bigvee_{n\\geq1}c_{n}=\\bigvee_{n\\geq1}k(w_{n}).\n$$\n\nWe now come to the representation theorem for monotone $\\sigma$-complete $C^{*}$-algebras.\n\nTheorem 5.4.5 Let $A$ be monotone $\\sigma$-complete. There exists a $\\sigma$-homomorphism $q$ from $A^{\\infty}$ onto $A$ such that $q(a)=a$ for each $a\\in A$. Then $A^{\\infty}\\cap\\mathcal{N}$ is a $\\sigma$-ideal of $A^{\\infty}$ and is the kernel of $q$. So $A$ is isomorphic to $A^{\\infty}/(A^{\\infty}\\cap\\mathcal{N})$.\n\nProof The smallest $\\sigma$-closed subspace of $A_{s a}^{\\prime\\prime}$ which contains $A_{s a}$ is $A_{s a}^{\\infty}$. So $A^{\\infty}\\subset W$. Let $q$ be the restriction of $k$ to $A^{\\infty}$. The result follows from Corollary 5.4.4.\n\nWe recall that the algebra $\\mathcal{N}$ is the complex linear span of $\\mathcal{M}^{+}$. We shall see from the results of Sect. 5.6, that in Theorem 5.6.5, we may replace $A^{\\infty}\\cap\\mathcal{N}$ by $A^{\\infty}\\cap\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nWhen specialized to commutative algebras, Theorem 5.4.5 corresponds to the Loomis-Sikorski theorem for Boolean $\\sigma$ -algebras [153].\n\nBy applying results of Birkhoff-Ulam for complete Boolean algebras, see Theorem 4.1.3, every commutative monotone complete $C^{*}$ -algebra can be represented as follows. Let $S$ be the spectrum of a commutative monotone complete $C^{*}$-algebra, then $C(S)$ is isomorphic to the quotient of the algebra of bounded Borel measurable functions on $S$ modulo the ideal of meagre Borel functions. This may be thought of as a special case, for commutative algebras, of the following representation theorem. See Theorem 4.2.9.\n\nTheorem 5.4.6 Let $A$ be monotone complete. There exists a $\\sigma$ -homomorphism $q$ from $A^{b}$ onto $A$ such that $q(a)=a$ for each $a\\in A$. Then $A^{b}\\cap{\\mathcal{N}}$ is a $\\sigma$-ideal of $A^{b}$ and is the kernel of $q$. So $A$ is isomorphic to $A^{b}/(A^{b}\\cap\\mathcal{N})$. Let $\\left(c_{\\lambda}\\right)$ be a norm bounded increasing net in $A_{s a}$ with least upper bound $c$ in $A_{s a}$. Let $\\operatorname*{lim}c_{\\lambda}$ be its strong (and so weak) operator limit in $A^{\\prime\\prime}$ (and so is in $A^{b}$), then\n\n$$\nq(\\operatorname*{lim}c_{\\lambda})=c.\n$$\n\nFurthermore, given $f\\in A_{s a}^{b}$, $q(f)\\leq0$ if and only if $f\\le0$ a.e. So $q(f)=0$ if, and only if, $f=0$ a.e.\n\nProof Let $\\left(c_{\\lambda}\\right)$ be a norm-bounded, upward directed net in $A_{s a}$. Then $\\operatorname*{lim}c_{\\lambda}$ is in $A^{b}$. By Lemma 5.4.3, $\\operatorname*{lim}c_{\\lambda}$ is also in $W$. By definition, $A_{s a}^{b}$ is the smallest $\\sigma$-closed subspace of $A^{\\prime\\prime}_{s a}$ which contains all $x$ that correspond to lower semi-continuous affine functions on $K$. So $A^{b}\\subset W$. Let $q$ be the restriction of $k$ to $A^{b}$.",
