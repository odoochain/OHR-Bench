The three stages of the Respecting Choices速 model include First Steps速, for generally well adults; Next Steps速, for adults diagnosed with chronic or life-limiting diseases; and Last Steps速, for those with a life expectancy of less than one year (Hammes & Briggs, 2011). The staged planning process is intended to meet the ongoing needs of the adult with chronic and/or life-limiting diseases (Hammes, et al., 2012; Hickman, et al., 2009).\n\n# Background\n\nThe initiative for ACP started over twenty years ago in the national legislature. The effort was predicated by a number of court cases pleading for a patient's right to choose whether to receive medical treatment (Ulrich, 1999). Two of the more publicized cases were Karen Ann Quinlan v. State of New Jersey and Nancy Cruzan v.

The PSDA provided the legal right for patients to determine which, if any, treatment options they preferred. It also allowed patients to appoint an advocate who would make decisions on their behalves in the event they were unable to do so (Duke, et al., 2009; Ulrich, 1999). The primary intention of the PSDA was to prevent cases similar to Quinlan's or Cruzan's from reoccurring by increasing the availability and utility of AD documents (Ulrich).\n\nUnfortunately, the AD documents that followed were often vague and left the interpretation of the document to the advocate (Andershed & Harstade, 2007; Kirchhoff",
