The amendment addressed and, in most cases, solved this problem by ending the terms of senators and representatives on January 3, and the term of the president on January 20 in the year following their November elections.\n\nThe Twenty-first Amendment (1933) repeals the unsuccessful Eighteenth Amendment. The Twenty-first Amendment, however, continued to ban the transport of alcohol into any state where its possession violated state law.\n\nThe Twenty-second Amendment (1951) limits presidents to a maximum of two elected terms. It was passed largely as a reaction to Franklin D. Roosevelt's election to four terms between 1933 and 1945.\n\nThe Twenty-third Amendment (1961) allows citizens living in Washington, D.C., to vote for president and vice president, a right previously denied residents of the nation's capital. The District of Columbia now has three presidential electors, the number to which it would be entitled if it were a state.\n\nThe Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964) prohibits poll taxes in federal electionsâ€”taxes paid in order to vote. Prior to the passage of this amendment, some states had used such taxes to keep low-income African Americans from voting.\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment (1967) establishes a process for the vice president to take over leadership of the nation when a president is disabled. It also sets procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president. This amendment addresses a delicate issue: when should a president be considered unable to perform the duties of the office? A few times in the nation's history, illness prevented a president from performing his official duties. Should the vice president be considered president during this time? The amendment says that when a president or vice president, with the support of the majority of the cabinet, writes to the president pro tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House expressing the inability of the president to perform the duties of the office, the vice president immediately becomes the acting president. In a conflict between the president and the vice president over this issue, Congress must decide who will perform the duties of the office.\n\nThe Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971) lowers the voting age in both federal and state elections to 18.\n\nThe Twenty-seventh Amendment (1992) makes congressional pay raises effective during the term following their passage. Originally proposed by James Madison in 1789, this amendment lingered in obscurity for more than 200 years until it was discovered by a university student.\n\n# Section 4 Assessment\n\n# Checking for Understanding\n\n1. Main Idea In a table, categorize the 27 amendments into the three major groups described in this section.\n\n$\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n \n\\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Constitutional Amendments}\\\\\n \n&&\\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n$\n\n2. Define prior restraint, probable cause, search warrant, arrest warrant, due process of law, eminent domain, lame duck, poll tax.\n\n3. Identify Bill of Rights, Chisholm v. Georgia. \n\n4. What rights are listed in the First Amendment?\n\n5. Identify the twentieth-century amendments that deal with voting rights.\n\n# Critical Thinking\n\n6. Analyzing Information How do the amendments to the Constitution preserve individual rights?\n\nGrowth of Democracy Amendments often reflect a change in society or a need for change in the structure and power of government.
