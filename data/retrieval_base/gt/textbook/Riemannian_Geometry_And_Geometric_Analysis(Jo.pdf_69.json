        "text": "Necessarily nondegenerate quadratic form on $V$ would suffice, but here we have no need to investigate the most general possible construction. On the contrary, for our purposes it suffices to take $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with its standard Euclidean scalar product. An orthonormal basis will be denoted by $e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}$.\n\nDefinition 1.8.1 The Clifford algebra $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$, also denoted $\\mathrm{Cl}(n)$, is the quotient of the tensor algebra $\\bigoplus_{k\\geq0}V\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes V$ generated by $V$ by the two-sided ideal generated by all elements of the form $v\\otimes v+\\|v\\|^{2}$ for $v\\in V$.\n\nThus, the multiplication rule for the Clifford algebra $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ is  \n\n$$\nv w+w v=-2\\langle v,w\\rangle\n$$  \n\nIn particular, in terms of our orthonormal basis $e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}$, we have  \n\n$$\ne_{i}{}^{2}=-1{\\mathrm{~and~}}e_{i}e_{j}=-e_{i}e_{j}{\\mathrm{~for~}}i\\neq j.\n$$  \n\nFrom this, one easily sees that a basis of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ as a real vector space is given by  \n\n$$\ne_{0}:=1,\\quad e_{\\alpha}:=e_{\\alpha_{1}}e_{\\alpha_{2}}\\ldots e_{\\alpha_{k}}\n$$  \n\nwith $\\alpha=\\{\\alpha_{1},\\ldots,\\alpha_{k}\\}\\subset\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ and $\\alpha_{1}<\\alpha_{2}\\ldots<\\alpha_{k}$. For such an $\\alpha$, we shall put $|\\alpha|:=k$ in the sequel. Thus, as a vector space, $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ is isomorphic to $A^{*}(V)$ (as algebras, these two spaces are of course different). In particular, the dimension of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ as a vector space is $2^{n}$. Also, declaring this basis as being orthonormal, we obtain a scalar product on $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ extending the one on $V$.\n\nWe define the degree of as being $|\\alpha|$. The of degree $k$ generate the $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ $e_{\\alpha}$ subset $\\operatorname{Cl}^{k}(V)$ of elements of degree $k$. We have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{Cl}^{0}=\\mathbb{R}}\\\\ {\\mathrm{Cl}^{1}=V.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFinally, we let $\\operatorname{Cl}^{e v}(V)$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{o d d}(V)$ be the subspaces of elements of even resp. odd degree. The former is a subalgebra of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$, but not the latter.\n\nLemma 1.8.1 The center of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ consists of those elements that commute with all $v\\in\\operatorname{Cl}^{1}(V)=V$. For $n$ even, the center is $\\mathrm{Cl}^{0}(V)$, while for $n$ odd it is $\\mathrm{Cl}^{0}(V)\\oplus\\mathrm{Cl}^{n}(V)$.\n\nProof. It suffices to consider basis vectors $e_{\\alpha} = e_{\\alpha_{1}}\\ldots,e_{\\alpha_{k}}$ as above. For $j\\not\\in\\alpha$, we have  \n\n$$\ne_{\\alpha}e_{j}=(-1)^{|\\alpha|}e_{j}e_{\\alpha},\n$$  \n\nand thus $|\\alpha|$ has to be even for $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ to commute with $e_{j}$, while  \n\n$$\ne_{\\alpha}e_{\\alpha_{j}}=(-1)^{|\\alpha|-1}e_{\\alpha_{j}}e_{\\alpha},\n$$",
