        "text": "The principal ideal $\\pi A$ generated by $\\pi$ can be described in terms of $\\pmb{v}$ as\n\n$\\{\\,x\\in K:v(x)>0\\,\\}$. It is a maximal ideal, since every element of $A$ not in\n\n$\\pi A$ is a unit. The quotient ring $k=A/\\pi A$ is therefore a field, called the residue field associated to the valuation $\\pmb{v}$.\n\nExample. Let $K$ be the field $\\mathbf{Q}$ of rational numbers, and let $\\pmb{p}$ be a prime number. The $\\pmb{p}$-adic valuation on $\\mathbf{Q}$ is defined by setting $v(x)$ equal to the exponent of $\\pmb{p}$ in the prime factorization of $\\pmb{x}$. More precisely, given $\\pmb{x}\\in\\mathbf{Q}^{*}$ write ${\\pmb x}={\\pmb p}^{n}{\\pmb u}$, where $\\pmb{n}$ is a (possibly negative) integer and $\\pmb{u}$ is a rational number whose numerator and denominator are not divisible by $\\pmb{p}$, then ${\\pmb v}({\\pmb x})=n$. The valuation ring $A$ is the ring of fractions $a/b$ with ${\\pmb a},{\\pmb b}\\in{\\bf Z}$ and $b$ not divisible by $\\pmb{p}$. [The ring $A$ happens to be the localization of $\\mathbf{z}$ at $\\pmb{p}$, but we will not make any use of this.] The residue field $\\pmb{k}$ is the field $\\mathbf{F}_{p}$ of integers mod $p$, one sees this by using the homomorphism $A\\nrightarrow\\mathbf{F}_{p}$ given by $a/b\\mapsto{\\big(}a{\\mathrm{~mod~}}p{\\big)}(b{\\mathrm{~mod~}}p)^{-1}$, where $\\pmb{a}$ and $b$ are as above.\n\nThe valuation ring $A$ in this example can be described informally as the largest subring of $\\mathbf{Q}$ on which reduction mod $\\pmb{p}$ makes sense. It is thus the natural ring to introduce if one wants to relate the field $\\mathbf{Q}$ to the field $\\mathbf{F}_{p}$. This illustrates our point of view toward valuations: We will be interested in studying things (namely, matrix groups) defined over a field $K$, and we wish to “reduce” to a simpler field $\\pmb{k}$ as an aid in this study; a discrete valuation makes this possible by providing us with a nice ring $A$ to serve as intermediary between $K$ and $\\pmb{k}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{A}&{\\hookrightarrow}&{K}\\\\ {\\downarrow}&{}&{}\\\\ k&{}&{}\\end{array}\n$$\n\nReturning now to the general theory, we note that the study of the arithmetic of $A$ (e.g., ideals and prime factorization) is fairly trivial:\n\nProposition 1. A discrete valuation ring $A$ is a principal ideal domain and every non-zero ideal is generated by $\\pi^{n}$ for some $n\\geq0$. In particular, $\\pi A$ is the unique non-zero prime ideal of $A$.\n\nPROOF: Let $I$ be a non-zero ideal and let $n=\\operatorname*{min}\\{v(a):a\\in I\\}$. Then $I$ contains $\\pi^{n}$, and every element of $I$ is divisible by $\\pi^{n}$; hence $I=\\pi^{n}A$. 口\n\nOne consequence of this is that we can apply the basic facts about modules over a principal ideal domain (e.g., a submodule of a free module is free). Let's recall some of these facts, in the form in which we'll need them later. Let $V$ be the vector space $K^{n}$. By a lattice (or A-lattice) in $V$ we will mean an $A$-submodule $L\\subset V$ of the form $L=A e_{1}\\oplus\\cdot\\cdot\\oplus A e_{n}$ for some basis $\\boldsymbol{e}_{1},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{e}_{n}$ of $V$. In particular, $L$ is a free $A$-module of rank $\\pmb{n}$. If we take $\\boldsymbol{e}_{1},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{e}_{n}$ to be the standard basis of $V$, then the resulting lattice is $A^{n}$, which we call the standard lattice.",
