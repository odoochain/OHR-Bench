Despite a merger between Kluwer and Reed-Elsevier being called off in the face of growing attention from antitrust agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, smaller, quieter mergers have proceeded toward the same end unnoticed. Large commercial publishers are steadily absorbing smaller publishers whose journals can round out their offerings and help them achieve brand identity, or critical mass, in specialty areas. In 1998 alone, Kluwer acquired Waverly/Williams Wilkins, Plenum, and Ovid Technologies; Taylor & Francis acquired Routledge and Carfax; Harcourt/Academic Press acquired Mosby; Bertelsmann, a large entertainment conglomerate, acquired Springer Verlag; and Elsevier Science acquired six publishers, including JAI Press, BioMedNet, and Beilstein. Smaller publishers undoubtedly see these mergers as opportunities to get their titles into the electronic mainstream. For library customers, this trend represents a loss of competition, which does not bode well for prices.  \n\n# Librarians creating mass, too  \n\nIn response, libraries, universities, and learned societies are beginning to experiment with creating critical mass of their own to challenge commercial publishers and drive prices down. Two such experiments are drawing attention. SPARC, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition founded by the Association of Research Libraries, uses funds pledged by its members to subsidize and support publishers whose e-journals can go head-to-head with very costly commercial journals but at lower subscription rates. SPARC has successfully launched electronic journals from two well-known chemical societies and a group of distinguished ecologists. (For more on SPARC, see Ken Frazier's \"Liberating Scholarship,\" LJ 10/15/98, p. 40-41. -Ed.)\n\nHighWire Press was begun by Stanford University Library in 1997 to assist society publishers in getting their journals online. With more than 100 titles now among its offerings and with growing markets in the United States and abroad, HighWire is challenging the assumption that full-featured web journals have to come from commercial STM publishers. These library-driven strategies, like the ones of the commercial publishers, are fueled by hopes of shaping future markets in their favor.\n\n# A global economy  \n\nPublishers and vendors have taken a hit from the economic crises in Asia and in Latin America. Reacting to the threat of significant cancellations in many Asian countries and in Brazil, some publishers attempted to protect their subscription base in these countries by extending credit directly to customers and/or to their agents to keep them from canceling titles. Other publishers decided to accept the cancellations and reduce their exposure to losses from bad credit. In the midst of the dilemma are agents, whose profits have also been affected by libraries that could not pay.  \n\nOn the positive side, the advent of the long-awaited Euro should have a stabilizing effect on periodical pricing, particularly for libraries in European countries, in that costs should become more transparent with fewer cross-border currency exchanges. Given the diversity among nations in the European Union relative to unemployment, inflation, and economic strength, experts split on the question of whether the dollar or the Euro will emerge as the favored currency in 1999. Either way, prices for serials sold across the Atlantic will be affected, just as they have in the past.  \n\n# Cost trends  \n\nDespite the chaos surrounding electronic journals, print subscriptions still command most of the serials dollars in libraries and, therefore, still require.\n\n# Periodical Prices for Public and School Libraries  \n\nTitles in EBSCO Publishing's general index, Magazine Article Summaries (MAS), are those most often subscribed to by school and public libraries in the United States based on data from EBSCO.\n\nSubscription Services. Table 7 provides historical data for about 35 titles in the index. Price increases for next year are expected to be in the range of five percent.\n\n$\n\\begin{tabular}{|lccccccccccc|}\n \n\\multicolumn{12}{|c|}{TABLE 7: COST HISTORY FOR TITLES IN MAGAZINE ARTICLE SUMMARIES} \\\\  \nMagazine Article Summaries & Average No. of Titles '95-'99 & Average Cost Per Title 1995 & Average Cost Per Title 1996 & \\% of Change '95-'96 & Average Cost Per Title 1997 & \\% of Change '96-'97 & Average Cost Per Title 1998 & \\% of Change '97-'98 & Average Cost Per Title 1999 & \\% of Change '98-'99 & '95-'99 \\% of Change \\\\  \nU.S. & 334 & \\$42.03 & \\$44.07 & 4.9 & \\$46.14 & 4.7 & \\$48.02 & 4.1 & \\$50.32 & 4.8 & 19.7 \\\\  \nNON-U.S. & 10 & 100.02 & 107.94 & 7.9 & 112.41 & 4.1 & 123.15 & 9.6 & 129.48 & 5.1 & 29.5 \\\\  \n\\end{tabular}\n$",
