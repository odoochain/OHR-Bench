        "text": "Side view of wing (in a frame of reference moving with the aircraft):  \n\n  \n\nIgnore the modification of the air flow due to the propeller.  \n\n(a) Consider the change in momentum of the air moving past the wing, with no change in speed while it does so. Derive expressions for the vertical lift force \\(L\\) and the horizontal drag force \\(D_{I}\\) on the wing in terms of wing dimensions, \\(\\nu, \\varepsilon,\\) and the air density \\(\\rho.\\) Assume the direction of air flow is always parallel to the plane of the side-view diagram. (3 marks)  \n\n(b) There is an additional horizontal drag force \\(D_{2}\\) caused by the friction of air flowing over the surface of the wing. The air slows slightly, with a change of speed \\(\\nu \\left(<< 1\\%\\right.\\) of \\(\\nu\\)) given by:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\nu}=\\frac{f}{A}\n$$  \n\nThe value of \\(f\\) is independent of \\(\\varepsilon.\\)  \n\nFind an expression (in terms of \\(M, f, A, S, \\rho\\) and \\(g_{r}\\) - the acceleration due to gravity) for the flight speed \\(\\nu_{\\theta}\\) corresponding to a minimum power being needed to maintain this aircraft in flight at constant altitude and velocity. Neglect terms of order \\((\\varepsilon^{2} f)\\) or higher. (3 marks)  \n\nYou may find the following small angle approximation useful:  \n\n$$\n1-\\cos\\varepsilon\\approx{\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\varepsilon}{2}}\n$$  \n\n(c) On the answer sheet, sketch a graph of power \\(P\\) versus flight speed \\(\\nu.\\) Show the separate contributions to the power needed from the two sources of drag. Find an expression (in terms of \\(M, f, A, S, \\rho\\) and \\(g\\)) for the minimum power, \\(P_{min}\\). (2 marks)",
