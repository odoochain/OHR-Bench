        "text": "# Registered Dietician I (RD)  \n\nA registered dietician evaluates a patient's nutritional intake and orders special diets for the patient to follow. They provide education to patients and families about special diets to manage their illness and to improve their nutrition. RDs must have completed a bachelor's degree and often have a master's degree. Most states require certification or license to practice.  \n\n# Medical Social Worker (MSW)  \n\nA medical social worker works with the patient and family to help them get support services such as counseling, financial assistance, and community services. An MSW provides emotional support to the family and works as an advocate to help meet the patient's needs. Social workers typically have at least a bachelor's degree. Clinical social workers must have a master's degree and two years post-masters supervised clinical experience. MSWs must be licensed within the state they practice.  \n\n# Home Health Aide (HHA)  \n\nUnder the supervision of a nurse, a HHA provides supportive care to patients within their homes. They work to increase or maintain independence, health, and well-being of the patient. HHAs provide or assist with self-care activities such as bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, feeding, skin care, use of medical supplies and equipment such as walkers and wheelchairs, and assisting with light housework, laundry, and home safety. Depending on the state in which they live and if they work in a certified home health agency, home health aides (HHAs) must be certified and complete training programs.  \n\n# Personal Care Aide (PCA)  \n\nUnder the supervision of a nurse, a PCA provides self-care and companionship to a patient. They assist with self-care activities such as bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, feeding, skin care, and use of assistive devices such as walkers and wheelchairs. They also assist with housekeeping tasks such as laundry, changing bed linens, washing dishes, and preparing meals. Personal care aides may not perform any type of medical service or task, as a Home Health Aide may. A PCA may not take vital signs or glucose meter readings. Personal Care Aides are usually trained on the job. There are no educational requirements to become a PCA, but most PCAs have a high school diploma.  \n\n# Patient/Family  \n\nThe patient and their family are the most important parts of the health care team. Patients have the right to make decisions about their healthcare. They have a right to be informed about treatments and the care they receive. They have a right to refuse treatments, medications, and services. All patients and their families are unique and have various needs, desires, cultures, and traditions. It is important that the healthcare team respect these individual differences and work to meet each patient's needs. Without the patient, there can be no healthcare team.  \n\n# Self Check Activity  \n\nMatch the team member with the role they play:  \n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\n \nTeam Member           & Role                                                                                                               \\\\  \n1.
