        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAny efficient Army, large or small, must be composed of men so selected, trained, and allocated that every technical and military requirement of the service is met adequately and promptly. Disciplining the men in the habit of instant obedience, training them in the manual of arms, and drilling them in close order and extended order formations is more important than ever before, in view of the large number of men involved.\n\nIn addition, the individual soldier, especially in combat troops, must show mental alertness, initiative, sense of responsibility, and devotion to duty to a high degree. The trained Army technician must also have these qualities developed in accordance with the requirements of his special work. Moreover, it is important that each soldier, officer, as well as enlisted man, understands fundamental business ideals and practices; that he is considerate, fair-minded, and reliable in his dealings with others; and that he understands his obligations as a citizen and is disposed to meet those obligations with fidelity and loyalty. As a basis for faithful and loyal service the enlisted man should know:\n1. How to speak, write, and read simple English with understanding.\n2. His duties as a soldier and citizen.\n3. Enough of the long struggle for liberty to understand its meaning and to appreciate its value.\n4. Enough of the sacrifices and achievements of America to inspire loyalty to the country and to the service.\n5. Enough about human interdependence to inspire his disposition to act honestly, industriously, reliably, cooperatively, and thriftily.\n6. Enough about current national and international problems to enable him to act intelligently in the discharge of his duties.\n7. Enough about the mechanism of the American Government to understand his place and responsibilities in it.\n\nThis course for enlisted men is designed to give them such knowledge and understanding of the army and the country it serves as will help them to perform their duties with intelligence and dependable loyalty.",

        "text": "SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INSTRUCTOR\n\nThis course is not an information course, and the materials in it are not to be learned by rote. In training it is one thing to tell a man what he should do, and think, and feel. It is quite another matter to lead men to do, and think, and feel as they should, and that is the purpose of this course. The old adage, \"we learn to do by doing,\" is recognized in Army training. It is equally true we learn to think by thinking. This principle is applied in the tactical walks in the training of officers and noncommissioned officers.\nIn tactical walks the director describes the general situation. He then sets up a problem and asks questions as to the proper action to be taken. After giving such instructions as are necessary to the proper solution of the problem, the director calls upon the members of the detachment to say what they would do under the circumstances. Other members of the detachment are called upon to criticise the answers given. During the discussion period, the director acts somewhat in the capacity of umpire, giving information, or rendering decisions from time to time, and at the close of the walk he holds a critique. In this way, while active thinking on the part of the detachment is maintained, and free discussions are held on the questions involved, the director is not drawn into argument, and does not find it necessary to debate his position.\nThis course should be handled by methods similar to those employed in tactical walks. Materials are presented that involye questions requiring thought to arrive at practical judgments and decisions. In the discussions that arise the officer in charge, like the director of tactical walks, need not be drawn into arguments and need not find it necessary to debate his position. The forum discussions, by which this course is to be conducted, and of which the officer in charge is the director and umpire, recognizes the principle that men learn to think by thinking. They are somewhat analogous to quickening games in physical training and are designed to develop mental alertness, initiative, and discrimination.\n\nThe introductory questions are designed to focus the attention of the men upon the topic in hand. It is not necessary that each question be settled to the complete satisfaction of everybody. Their main purpose is to get the minds of the men actively engaged with some common problem. The tactful instructor will know how to bring a discussion to a close at the proper time.",

In many instances the instructor will be able to supply better questions, and will find better cases in his own experiences than those given in the readings.\n\nThe exercises in written English will be found valuable when the conditions of instruction makes it feasible to use them; otherwise, they are to be omitted.\n\nThis manual is not to be considered solely as a text for instruction purposes. In places where it is not feasible to assemble the men in small groups for instruction by means of discussion, as described above, the manual furnishes information and suggestions upon which officers may draw in preparing talks for the men. Regulations and details of organization are being changed from time to time. Officers and instructors will therefore find it necessary to revise many specific statements in the manual in order to keep it up to date.\n\nThe instructor should realize fully that the materials of this course are suggestive only, and he should not hesitate to make any additions or modifications that his own experience and local conditions suggest.",

        "text": "THE MISSION OF THE SOLDIER\n\nNote to Instructor:\n\nWe tend to acoept things with which we are familiar as a matter of counse. We turn on the water and electric light without giving a thought to the men, money, and machinery that provide them for us. We expect the trains to be on time and to find the drug store open at any hour of the day or night. For a few dollars we buy a suit of clothes that woolgrowers, sailors, machinists, bankers, and a host of others have worked to produce. At every turn we use things that we could not possibly produce for ourselves. And we go about in safety unmindful of the complex arrangements that are set up to insure life, liberty, comfort, and heafth. We accept them all as a matter of course. It is only when something goes wrong-when the system breaks down, or when some individual or group fails in the performance of duty - that we become conscious of our dependence on others. By division of labor our hands are multiplied, and, while we work for many doing the things that fall to us to do, many are working for us and they expect us to do our part, just as we expect them to do theirs.\n\nOne of the most important problems in organizing society is to maintain law and order and to protect the people while they carry on their peaceful pursuits. Without such protection the world would soon be peopled with scattered tribes of wandering savages. It is the mission of the soldier to furnish protection, and his work requires special training to give him the knowledge and skill necessary to do it well.\n\nIntroductory Questions:\n1. What part do the following people have in the making of your clothes:\n(a) Miners\n(b) Sailors\n(c) Chemists\n(d) Machinists\n(e) Woolgrowers\n(f) Stenographers\n(g) Bankers\n(h) Merchants\n(i) Locomotive engineers\n(j) Teachers",

What do soldiers do to pay for what others do for them?\n\nReadings:\n\n1\nJohn Logan lived in a small Massachusetts village 100 years ago. He had a growing family, the land was poor, and work scarce. It was hard for him to make a living and he saw that it would be still harder there for his children to get along. Hearing of the rich land to the West to be had for nothing, he loaded his family and his goods into a covered wagon and, with several of his neighbors, drove through to what is now northern Ohio. Here he settled down, with the help of his neighbors built a log cabin, cleared a patch of ground, and began to farm the land. He worked in the field, plowing, sowing, cultivating, and harvesting the crop, his gun always at hand to protect his wife and children against inroads from the Indians. The protection he could give them was slight. His old flintlock musket could be fired but once and then had to be reloaded slowly. In case of a raid he was one man against many, with his nearest neighbors some distance away. The best he could do was to hold back the Indians until his family could find safety in the log house or the stockade. In times past many families were wiped out by the Indians because they did not have proper protection.\n\nSome years ago a flood at Dayton, Ohio, destroyed a large amount of property and killed many people. During the disorder that took place soldiers policed the city; guarded and helped distribute to those in want the food, clothing, and other supplies sent in from the outside; assisted in the rescue of many people; helped clean away the rubbish left by the flood; built temporary bridges; and even manned some of the street cars.\n\nOn October 12, 1918, Lieutenant Woodfill was ordered with his patrol to take Company $M$ forward to make a reconnaisance to",

The following citation accompanying the congressional medal of honor awarded him tells the rest:\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy at Cunnel, France, October 12,1918 . While he was leading his company against the enemy his line came under heavy machine-gun fire, which threatened to hold up the advance. Followed by two soldiers at 25 yards, this officer went out ahead of his first line toward a machine-gun nest and worked his way around its flank, leaving two soldiers in front. When he got within 10 yards of the gun it ceased firing and four of the enemy appeared, three of whom were shot by Lieutenant Woodfill. The fourth, an officer, rushed at Lieutenant Woodfill, who attempted to club the officer with his pistol. After a hand-to-hand struggle he killed the officer with his pistol. His company thereupon continued to advance until, shortly afterwards, another ma-chine-gun nest was encountered. Calling his men to follow, Lieutenant Woodfill rushed ahead of his line in the face of heavy fire from the nest, and when several of the enemy appeared above the nest he shot them, capturing three other members of the crew and silencing the gun. A few minutes later this officer for the third time demonstrated conspicuous daring by charging another machinegun position and killing five men in a machine-gun pit with his rifle. He then drew his revolver and started to jump into the pit when two other gunners turned their guns on him. Failing to keep them back with his revolver, he grabbed a pick lying near and killed both of them. Inspired by the exceptional courage displayed by this officer, his men pressed on to their objective under severe shell and machine-gun fire.\"\n\n4\n\nIn the summer of 1900 Dr. Walter Reed and a group of other Army surgeons were investigating the cause of yellow fever in Habana, Cuba. In studying the theory that the disease was transmitted by the bite of a certain mosquito, it became necessary to have subjects who would submit themselves for experiment with the possible result of contracting yellow fever.\n\"The subject of the first experiment was a young private from Ohio, named John R. Kissinger, who volunteered for the service, to use his own words, 'solely in the interest of humanity and the cause of science.' When it became known among the troops that subjects were needed for experimental purposes, Kissinger, in company with another young private named John J. Moran, also from Ohio, volunteered their services. Dr. Reed talked the matter over with them, explaining fully the danger and suffering involved in",

        "text": "II\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY\n\nNote to Instructor:\n\nWe have only to look about us to see the great importance of organization in life. Every man can go about the work in which he is interested only because the work of the world is organized. When we want something to eat, we go to the grocery store and buy it. When we want clothes, we go to the clothing store for them. When we need medical advice, we call a physician. When we need legal advice, we consult a lawyer. When we need money, we ask the bank for help. When we wish to travel, we use the railroad. In a well-ordered society, every man does his special work, in which he becomes proficient, while others do other things which are useful to the group. Even individual enterprises are organized. A bank has its board of directors, president, vice presidents, cashiers, bookkeepers, paying and receiving tellers, errand boys, and janitors. Thus all people form a great team, each having his special part to play. To be a good player, each must know how to do his part and must play according to the spirit and rules of the game.\n\nThe Army's part in our national team is to defend us against undue interference. We have great wealth and certain national ideals and traditions. We can not afford to have them destroyed. To defend them, the Army must be thoroughly organized, and must cultivate every virtue of team-play.\nIt is the purpose of this period to discuss army organization from the standpoint of individual responsibility of the soldier, that he may be led to feel that in the performance of the routine of military service, he is executing the collective will of the people as it comes through the various official channels from the commanding general, even from the President, down to him.\n\nIntroductory Questions:\n1. What is an army?\n2. What is the difference between an army and a mob?\n3. Why is an army more effective than a mob?\n\nReading:\n\nThe war strength organization of the Infantry, which is typical of all arms of the military service, is as follows:\n1. The squad.-The squad consists of eight men, including a corporal in charge. The squad is the unit in which the private",

Outside of it the private soldier has few interests. The squad is the unit upon which all of the work of the platoon and the company depend. Unless the men of each squad work together as a single man, the work of the platoon becomes well-nigh impossible.\n2. The platoon.-Strictly a fighting unit. It is normally composed of six squads, with noncommissioned officers and others who bring the total up to a strength of 57 enlisted men. It is commanded normally by a lieutenant. For combat the platoon is divided into two sections. Each section is normally under the command of a sergeant, who has a corporal (section guide) as an assistant. The lieutenant commanding the oplatoon is known as the platoon leader, and he has as an assistant a platoon sergeant and a detachment of privates for duty as runners and signal men. This makes up the platoon headquarters. The education of the soldier is begun in the squad and finished in the platoon. When he learns what is expected of the squad and the platoon, and acquires the spirit of teamplay in these organizations, he is a trained and efficient member of his organization.\n3. The company.-The rifle company consists of three platoons and the company headquarters, consisting of a detachment of noncommissioned officers, clerks, buglers, cooks, runners, and signal men. The total strength of a company is 200 men and six officers. The company serves as a link to hold the platoons together and make them mutually supporting. The company commander assigns missions to the platoons in combat. The platoons apply to him for assistance they may need in carrying out their mission. The company is also the housekeeping agency-platoons do the fighting, but that is all they do as platoons. They must eat, sleep, draw clothing and pay, and be supplied with shelter, bathing facilities, and medical attendance. The company organization provides for all of this. The company may be likened to a large family, with three fighting members, the platoons, and a housekeeping member, the company headquarters.\n4. The battalion.-The battalion is composed of five companies, three rifle companies, one machine-gun company, and one headquarter company. It is normally commanded by a major.\n5. The regiment.-Three battalions, headquarters company, howitzer company, service company, attached medical department, and chaplain form a regiment, commanded by a colonel.\n6.

This indicates the necessity for the development of the habit of instant obedience to orders, and the habit of prompt execution of his own decisions when occasion arises.\n\nNo mechanical formula can be given for the development of these tendencies to act. At times it is necessary to exercise arbitrary and driving authority. By and large, however, the soldier who takes an interest in his work and who understands its purpose and importance will be more reliable than the one who yields passive obedience only.\n\nThe skillful leader will employ any or all means at his legitimate disposal to achieve the ends desired. Experience has shown that men are actuated by many motives and the best results are secured when the soldier has confidence in his officer, is ambitious to advance, understands the significance of what he is doing, and likes military life. One effective way to build up these desirable attitudes is tharoangh carefully directed discussions of the meaning and purpose of discipline and the means employed to secure it.\nIntroductory Questions:\n1. How do the players of a football game know what to do?\n2. Why do they have signals?\n3. Why do they practice their plays over and over?\n4. What would happen if each player paid no attention to the signals and tried to do as he pleased?\n5. When does a player have to use his own judgment?\n6. In what respects is a soldier like a member of a football team?\n7. Why can 100 trained soldiers control a mob of a thousand men?\n8. What is the difference between an army and a mob?\n\nReadivers:\n\n1\n\nAt one of the training camps during the war an officer addressed a squad of new recruits as follows:\n\"Men, I want you to get the right idea of the salute. I do not want you to think that you are being compelled to salute me as an individual. No! When you salute me, you are simply rendering respect to the power I represent; and the power I represent is you.",

The salute is going to be rigidly enforced in this Army, and I want you to get the right idea of it. I want you to know what you salute and why.\"\n(Adapted from Community Civics, Dunn, p. 51.)\n\n2\n\nWhen people use the word \"habit,\" in the majority of instances it is a bad habit which they have in mind. They talk of the smoking habit, and the swearing habit, and the drinking habit, but not of the habit of obedience, or the habit of self-control, or the habit of courage. But the fact is that our virtues are habits as much as our vices. All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits.\n\nNinety-nine hundredths, or, possibly, nine hundred and ninetynine thousandths of our activity is purely habitual, from our rising in the morning to our lying down each night. Our dressing and undressing, our eating and drinking, our greetings and partings, our hat raisings and giving way for ladies to precede; nay, even most of the forms of our common speech, are things of a type so fixed by repetition that we do them without thinking.\n* * * There is no more miserable human being than one to whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work are subjects of express volitional deliberation. Full half the time of such a man goes to the deciding or regretting of matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as practically not to exist for his consciousness at all.\n(Adapted from Talks to Teachers, Wm. James, pp. 64-67.)\n\nIn all this Cuban business there is one man that stands out on the horizon of my menory like Mars at perihelion. When war broke out between Spain and the United States, it was necessary to communicate quickly with the leader of the insurgents.
