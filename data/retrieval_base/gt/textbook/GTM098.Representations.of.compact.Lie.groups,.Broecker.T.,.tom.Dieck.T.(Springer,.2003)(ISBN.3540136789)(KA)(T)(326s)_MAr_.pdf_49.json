Assume further that the maps $\\alpha_{p}\\colon G\\to M$, $G \\mapsto pg$ are injections for every $p\\in M$. Show that the $G$-manifold has the structure of a differentiable $G$-principal bundle.\n\n4. Show that a bijective immersion of differentiable manifolds is a diffeomorphism. Hint: An immersion $f\\colon M\\to N$ is locally an embedding. If we had dim $N >$ dim M, then $f(M)$ would have Lebesgue measure zero (locally) in $N$ (see Brocker and Janich [1], $\\S 6$).\n\n5. Show that any two fibers of the Hopf fibration (4.10) are linked in $S^{3}$: see Hopf [1].\n\n  \nFigure 12\n\n6. Give a diffeomorphism $\\mathrm{SO}(3)\\cong\\mathbb{R}P^{3}$, and, if you know enough about fundamental groups, show that $\\pi_{1}(\\mathrm{SO}(n))\\cong\\mathbb{Z}/2$ for $n > 2$ with a generator represented by the mapping $S^{1}=\\mathrm{SO}(1)\\to\\mathrm{SO}(n)$.\n\n7. Show that ${\\mathrm{Sp}}(n)$ is simply connected. Show that $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ is simply connected.\n\n8. Show that there is a $G$-equivariant diffeomorphism of homogeneous spaces $G/H\\to G/K$ if and only if $H$ and $K$ are conjugate in $G$.\n\n9. Show that a homomorphism of tori $T^{n}\\to T^{k}$ is induced by a linear map $\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{k}$ whose associated matrix has integer coefficients.\n\n10. Show that the only noncompact topologically cyclic Lie group is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n11. Let $G$ be a Lie group and let $X, Y \\in \\mathbb{L}(G)$. Show that $[X,Y]=0$ if and only if $\\exp(s X)\\cdot\\exp(t Y)=\\exp(t Y)\\cdot\\exp(s X)$ for all $s, t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. If $G$ is connected, then the Lie algebra of the center of $G$ is $\\{X\\in L G|[X, Y]=0$ for all $Y\\in LG$.\n\n# 5. Invariant Integration\n\nLet $X$ be a locally compact space and $C_{c}^{0}(X)$ be the vector space of continuous real-valued functions on $X$ with compact support. An integral on $X$ is a monotone linear map\n\n$$\n\\int\\colon C_{c}^{0}(X)\\to\\mathbb{R},\\quad f \\mapsto\\int f.\n$$\n\n\"Monotone\" means that if $f(x)\\leq g(x)$ for all $x\\in X$, then $\\int f\\leq\\int g$. The integral $\\int f$ is often denoted $\\int_{X}f(x)\\,d x$.",
