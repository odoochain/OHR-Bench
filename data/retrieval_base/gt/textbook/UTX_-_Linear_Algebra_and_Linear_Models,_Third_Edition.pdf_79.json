        "text": "where  $\\varepsilon_{i j}$  are independent with mean O and variance  $\\sigma^{2}$. This model arises when we want to compare  $k$  treatments. We have  $n_{i}$  observations on the  $i$  -th treatment. The parameter  $\\mu$  is interpreted as the \"general effect,\" and  $\\alpha_{i}$  is the \"effect due to the  $i$  -th treatment.\" We wish to find the RSs. Instead of writing the model in standard form, we follow a different approach. The RSS is the minimum value of  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}(y_{i j}-\\mu-\\alpha_{i})^{2}.\n$$  \n\nWe use the fact that if  $u_{1},.\\ldots,u_{m}$  are real numbers, then  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(u_{i}-\\theta)^{2}\n$$  \n\nis minimized when  $\\theta=\\overline{{u}}$  , the mean of  $u_{1},\\ldots,u_{n}$. This is easily proved using calculus. The sum (7.8) is minimized when  $\\mu+\\alpha_{i}=\\overline{{y}}_{i.},i=1,\\ldots,k;$  and therefore  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{RSS}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}(y_{i j}-{\\overline{{y}}}_{i.})^{2}.\n$$  \n\nNow, suppose we wish to find the RSS subject to the constraints  $\\alpha_{i}-\\alpha_{j}=0$  for all  $i,j$  . Since  $\\alpha_{i}=\\alpha_{j}$  is estimable, we may proceed to apply 7.6. Thus, we must calculate  $\\tilde{\\alpha}$  using the formula immediately preceding 7.6. However, again there is a more elementary way. Let  $\\alpha$  denote the common value of  $\\alpha_{1},.\\,.\\,.\\,,\\,\\alpha_{k}$. Then we must minimize  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}(y_{i j}-\\mu-\\alpha)^{2}\n$$  \n\nand this is achieved by setting  \n\n$$\n\\mu+\\alpha=\\overline{{y}}_{..}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}y_{i j},\n$$  \nwhere $\\textstyle n=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_{i}$  Thus the RSS now is\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}(y_{i j}-{\\overline{{y}}}_{..})^{2}.\n$$\n\n\nThe computation of RSS subject to linear restrictions will be useful in deriving a test of the hypothesis that the restrictions are indeed valid. This will be achieved in the next chapter.",
