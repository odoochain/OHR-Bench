        "text": "# \n# \nBy JULIAN D. SEARS \n# \nThe area described,in San Juan County,Utah,is approximately 7 miles wide and extends from the San Juan River northward for about 20 miles.It includes thenorthernpartofCombRidgeand anarrowbeltoneachside. \nAltitudes range from 4,170feet onSanJuanRiver at the southwest to 6,000 feet on Grand Gulch Plateau at the northwest, where its eastern rim forms a high escarpment.Comb Ridge, a conspicuous hogback of eastward-dipping rocks extending through the area and far to the southwest, is the most striking topographic feature and a nearly impassable barrier. \nSan Juan River is the major drainage course and the only perennial stream. It cuts across Comb Ridge, follows the strike in softer beds for 2 miles, and then flows in a deep, tortuous canyon through steeply dipping hard rocks. Comb and Butler Washes are the two principal tributaries, fowing in strike valleys. These streamsandtheirnumerousbranchesshowcloseadjustmenttothenature and structure of the formations over which they run. \nThis remote area is about 140 miles by road from the railroad to the north and about 215 miles from that to the south. No one is now living within its boundaries.The nearest communities are Blanding and Bluff to the east and MexicanHat to the west.Only one main road,the newly improved StateHighway 47, reaches the area, and it crosses the southern part.A new, similar rocksurfacedroadextendingfromBlanding totheNaturalBridgescomeswithina few miles of the area's northern edge. The only other roads within the area are of dirt; after the abnormal rains and foods in the summer of 1953 they werenearlyunusable. \nThe exposed sedimentary formations range in age from Pennsylvanian to Recent and aggregate 5,0oo feet or more in thickness. The oldest rocks—the upper part of the Hermosa and the lower part of the Rico—are exposed in the deep canyon of San Juan River.Hard upper limestones of the Rico form the surface of a structural uplift and topographic upland near the river. Successively younger formations crop out toward the east,the youngest being the Bluff sandstone of Late Jurassic age, which forms a westward-facing escarpment along the east margin of the area. Most of the formations show approximately the same appearance and thickness that is characteristic of them over a wide region. A few show more variation or unusual features. The Cedar Mesa sandstone member of the Cutler formation, usually made up chiefy of a thick series of massive gray to buff sandstones, has a soft zone about 130 feet thick at its base in the northern part of the area. Farther south, the entire member, 830 feet thick, grades laterally within a short distance into a soft facies 'of very nonresistant sandstone,much light-coloredclay,and many beds of gypsum.The De Chelly sandstone member and the Hoskinnini tongue,both of the Cutler formation,together form onlya thin zonein thesouthernpart of theareaandseemtowedgeoutnorthwardinitscentralpart.Theformations of the San Rafael group, though maintaining a constant thickness, show marked lithologic changes from south to north in Butler Wash.In this group the Carmel formation changes from mostly soft reddish sandstones and mudstonestoa unit composed chiefly of gray to buff sandstones with a soft reddish band in the middle. The upper part of the Entrada sandstone, which at the south is a zone of soft thin-bedded brick-red shalysandstones,becomes northwardamassive red sandstone. The Summerville formation is composed of grayish-brown or tan thin-bedded sandstones, sandy siltstones, and some minor shaly beds at the south; northward the upper part changes to a distinct reddish brown, becomes less thin bedded, and includes several thin grayish-white sandstones."

        "text": "Alluvium, slope wash, windblown sand, and terrace gravels seen at many places within the area are omitted from the map. \nIgneous rock was noted only in one small lamprophyre dike near San Juan River. \nThe area is in the eastern part of the broad regional Monument upwarp, and its principal structural feature is the great Comb monocline, which forms the eastern fank of that upwarp. In the northwest corner, on Grand Gulch Plateau, the area includes a relatively few square miles. of the nearly horizontal beds that make up the broad top of the upwarp. The northeast end of one of the subordinate anticlines that complicate the Monument upwarp is exposed in the southwest corner, where the structure is clearly revealed by the shape of the surface eroded on the thin but very resistant uppermost limestone of the Rico formation. \nA large fault, in part single, in part compound, is in the southern part of the area. With downthrow on the south, to a maximum of perhaps 200 feet, it begins in the Rico formation, extends northeast across the younger formations exposed in Comb Wash, and dies out before reaching Comb Ridge. \nTwo small faults on the northeast nose of the subordinate anticline mentioned above show minor overthrusting toward the southwest and suggest that, after uplift, the anticline may have subsided slightly and caused some lateral compression. \n# \n# \nThe area (see fg. 40) described in this report is in the southern part of San Juan County, Utah. It is a northward-trending belt nearly 7 miles wide and 21 miles in maximum length and covers about 130 square miles.  On the east it is bounded by longitude $109^{\\circ}37^{\\prime}30^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathrm{~W~}$ and on the west by 109o45' and extends from the San Juan River on the south to latitude 37°30' N. It thus covers about two and a quarter $7\\%$ -minute quadrangles: the Bluff 1 NW and Bluff 1 SW quadrangles and the northern part of the Bluf 4 NW quadrangle. \n# \nThough of considerable stratigraphic and structural interest, the area had previously been studied only by reconnaissance and mapped only on small scales. Added details and larger scale mapping were needed because of the marked variations in stratigraphy and the abrupt structural changes. Furthermore, the project was designed to supply a certain amount of instruction and practice in field investigation and in techniques of mapping stratigraphy and structure by means of planetable and air photographs to selected groups of younger members of. the U. S. Geological Survey--well-trained geologists and paleontologists whose experience had been principally in other specialized lines."

        "text": "# \nThe project was planned and carried out under immediate supervision of the writer assisted by R. Dewey Sample. For the first 8 weeks the staff members assigned to the party were Gerald W. Fuller, Mineral Deposits Branch; Chabot Kilburn, Fuels Branch; Sergius H. Mamay, Paleontology and Stratigraphy Branch; and Warren L. Peterson, Engineering Geology Branch. For the ensuing 6 weeks the members assigned were Mendell M. Bell, Mineral Deposits Branch; Max H. Bergendahl, General Geology Branch ; Mario A. Conti, Military Geology Branch; and Ellis L. Yochelson, Paleontology and Stratigraphy Branch. Throughout the season, Robert A. Madden served as field assistant and aided in stadia traverses and other mapping as well as in miscellaneous camp duties. \n# \nThe investigation on which this report is based was carried out in the field from early June to mid-September 1953. For most of the season the party maintained a base camp in Comb Wash. Transportation by jeeps and light trucks to points. where foot traverses started was impeded by an abnormal series of heavy rains, which caused the dirt roads to become virtually impassable and even brought temporary closing of the two main rock-surfaced roads. \nRecent large-scale air photographs were used, by means of portable stereoscopes, in laying out the work and studying the geology ; on them the formational boundaries were drawn and other geologic data were noted. Most of the actual mapping, however, was done by planetable and telescopic alidade. Significant points were located on both the photographs and the planetable sheets, and boundaries between those points were sketched from the photographs on the sheets. A triangulation network for horizontal control was established for the whole area. Vertical control was set up by determining the elevation of triangulation points by vertical angles, starting from a bench mark near the “Mormon Trail\" road half a mile north of State Highway 47. Insofar as possible, instrument stations and other points were located by triangulation. However, in much of the area—in the deep canyons with unscalable walls, in the lower part of Comb Wash, and on the rounded limestone upland west of the wash-triangulation was not feasible, and it was necessary to resort to more time-consuming stadia traverses. Even such traverses could not be made in the deep canyons cutting Grand Gulch Plateau because of the growing danger from recurring fash floods; for those canyons the geology that had been studied and recorded on the air photographs was transferred to a controlled photographic mosaic of the area and used in compiling the final map."

        "text": "During the course of the fieldwork, about a score of section and quarter corner pipes established by the Bureau of Land Management were observed and located by triangulation. Most of the area, however, is unsurveyed or only partly surveyed. The corners found are mostly on a range-line survey along the west side of Tps. 38 and 39 S., R. 21 E.; two of them are within a partial interior survey in T. 38 S., R. 21 E.; and a few are in the southern part of T. 40 S., R. 20 E. \nThe results of the season's fieldwork are brought together in a general geologic map of the field (pl. 17). \n# \nThe writer is grateful to numerous officials, merchants, and other residents in Blanding, Bluff, and Mexican Hat for the helpful information and other assistance they gave to the party during its fieldwork. \nLawrence C. Craig and Thomas E. Mullens, of the U. S. Geological Survey, visited the party during the season, shared their broad knowledge of the regional geology, and supplied an unpublished section they measured in the area in 1951. \nWilliam R. Hemphill, of the U. S. Geological Survey, contributed substantial assistance by making numerous measurements and calculations, from air photographs by means of a stereometer, of strikes and dips and of formation thicknesses on Comb Ridge and in Butler Wash. \n# \n# \nThe area of Comb Ridge and vicinity, north of the San Juan River, mapped in the summer of 1953, is but a small part of a region called by Gregory (1938) “the San Juan country.\" The reader is referred to his report, not only for the regional geologic and geographic setting for the smaller area but also for many details of geography and physiography that cannot be discussed in the present brief report and for an account of the human history of the region-its prehistoric and later Indian dwellers and its exploration and settlement. \n# \nTotal relief within the mapped area is approximately 1,800 feet, the altitude ranging from about 4,170 feet on San Juan River.at the southwest corner to about 6,0o0 feet on Grand Gulch Plateau at the northwestcorner. \nComb Ridge is the most striking topographic feature.

        "text": "Arizona. Its eastern slope is a hummocky surface eroded on the Navajo sandstone in a belt from a third of a mile to a mile or more in width. Its western face is much more abrupt; above a steep slope of clays and sandstones of the Chinle formation, rises a well-nigh vertical·cliff, at most places several hundred feet high, of massive Wingate sandstone and the lower sandstones of the Kayenta formation. Thus the west face of the ridge, towering to a constant height of about 800 feet above the adjacent Comb Wash (see pl. 18A), forms an almost impassable barrier. At only one place within the mapped area can it be crossed with vehicles--where a dugway has been blasted out on the north side of a reentrant to carry State Highway 47. South of that road, there are places where, because of jointing in the Wingate sandstone, the ridge can with dificulty be climbed on foot ; but in the more than 16 miles between the highway and the north edge of the mapped area its westward-facing cliff probably is unscalable. Several miles still farther rorth, near the Perkins Ranch in Comb Wash, another reentrant on the west side of the ridge was used in the spring of 1953 to construct a dugway for a new road between Blanding and the Natural Bridges National Monument. (See pl. 20A.) \nAnother conspicuous, though somewhat less striking, topographic feature is the high escarpment that extends northeastward across the northwest corner of the area. This is the eastern margin of the wide upland known as Grand Gulch Plateau, which rises to an altitude several hundred feet greater than that of the northern part of Comb Ridge. The plateau is underlain by a thick series of nearly horizontal heavy sandstones, and the high escarpment and the walls of the deep canyons that are cut back into it are unscalable at most places.  Where the escarpment crosses the west edge of the mapped area, however, the old \"Mormon Trail\" road zigzags to the top of the plateau. \nThe third prominent upland within the area is in the southwest corner, where by uplift and erosion the hard gray limestone at the top of the Rico formation is exposed as a domelike surface. After passing Comb Wash, State Highway 47 climbs and crosses this upland on its way southwest into the valley of Lime Creek and to the bridge over the river at Mexican Hat. \nThe San Juan River, which forms the southern boundary of the mapped area, is the major drainage course and the only perennial stream. Near and downstream from Bluff the river occupies an open valley cut in nearly horizontal rocks, but as the easterly dips of the beds become steeper the valley grows narrower. After passing in a fairly wide and low gap through Comb Ridge, the river turns south and follows the general strike of the softer beds in the Cutler formation for some 2 miles. At that point it swings to the northwest and cuts boldly into the steep dip of the hard Rico and Hermosa formations, in a deep, tortuous canyon-—the beginning of a series of spectacular entrenched meanders,thebestknown and mostvisited ofwhich are the \"Goosenecks\" downstream from Mexican Hat. Some 2 miles below its upper end the canyon has its right wall breached by the edge of a striking, deeply entrenched, and almost oval oxbow that marks a cutoff canyon loop occupied by the river when fowing at a higher level. The bottom of this oxbow is now marked by two small dry stream beds, which join near their lower ends and drain into the present canyon by a high “dry waterfall.\""

        "text": "The two principal tributaries within the mapped area are Comb Wash and Butler Wash. Comb Wash and its upper branches head on the south fiank of Elk Ridge; Butler Wash heads somewhat farther south. Both streams fow south and southwest, closely fanking Comb Ridge on its west and east sides, respectively, to their junction with the San Juan River. The locations and patterns of both streams reflect the relative hardness and structure of the underlying and adjacent formations. Both streams closely follow the strike; and as their valleys were being slowly lowered in the softer rocks, both streams probably migrated laterally eastward down the dip slopes of the underlying more resistant Cedar Mesa sandstone member and the Navajo sandstone respectively. \nIn its upper reaches Comb Wash flows south in a fairly wide shallow channel cut in earlier valley fill; its meanders are of moderate size, and its low alluvial banks are fanked by deposits of windblown sand and slope wash. Downstream, where the strike is more to the southwest and the dips are much steeper, the valley and the belt of alluvium are much narrower, and the exposures of bedrock ·are better. (See pl. 18A.) \nButler Wash is similar in some ways and different in others. In its upper reaches it, too, fows in an alluvium-filled valley; but its meanders are much smaller and more twisted, and its channel is narrower and deeper. Downstream, beginning where the strike swings to the southwest (just as does the narrowing of Comb Wash valley), the alluvium abruptly ceases; and the wash flows in a narrow canyon cut in the Navajo sandstone. \nThe many side streams entering Comb and Butler Washes also clearly show the effect of the varied geology and topography of the area and present many interesting physiographic problems that deserve more detailed study than could be devoted to them in the course of the fieldwork. Those tributaries entering Comb Wash on the east are numerous; but being confined to the narrow slope of clay at the foot of the west side of Comb Ridge, they are short and shallow. Those on the west are much larger and more conspicuous. They are also much more varied, falling into three principal types. In the northern part of the area, where the thick Cedar Mesa sandstone member is very hard and resistant, the streams fow in deep, formidable canyons."

        "text": "Farther south, between the lower reaches of Road Canyon and Snake Gulch, the Cedar Mesa is much softer and less resistant, and the principal streams and their innumerable branches make an intricate leafvein pattern. Still farther south the streams have cut deeply into the southeastward-dipping hard limestones and sandstones of the Rico formation. Some of these streams show anomalies in their lower courses in that, where they cut across the steeply dipping hard layers in the Halgaito and Cedar Mesa, they fow northeast instead of southeast toward Comb Wash as would be expected. These anomalies are thought to be due to the softening effect of northeastward-trending fractures and incipient faults in those beds, parallel to the large fault shown on the map. \nThe side drainage of Butler Wash is of more usual types.  The many roughly parallel streams fowing down the east slope of Comb Ridge are conspicuous because of the rounded trenches they have eroded in the dip slope of the Navajo sandstone; but they are of physiographic interest particularly because a number of them, upon reaching the foot of that slope, do not enter Butler Wash directly but first turn south and run for considerable distances before entering the main stream. \nComb and Butler Washes and their branches are all intermittent streams, usually fowing only in prompt response to rainfall. A single heavy, though local, storm may send a fash food many feet deep down a side canyon.  When this food pours into the main stream it widens out but still may fill the channel bank to bank with a muddy stream several feet deep persisting for perhaps half a day. \n# \nThe area lies within a semiarid region and with its relatively high altitudes has the characteristic scanty rainfall (averaging perhaps 8 or 10 inches a year) and large daily and yearly range of temperatures (from a winter minimum below zero to a summer maximum of well above 100 degrees). Readings are not taken within the area itself; the nearest Weather Bureau stations are at Blanding, Bluff, and Mexican Hat, a few miles northeast, east, and southwest of its limits, respectively; and the approximate figures given above are based on the available records from those three stations over the past decade. Most of the rain falls in brief local showers, some of which are very heavy. Only a minor part of the precipitation is absorbed to become ground water. In a few of the canyons, there are small water seepages, but most of them are only large enough to cause wet patches for a short distance downstream and few merit the name of \"spring.\" To the writer's knowledge, the largest spring within the area was the long-known and frequently used “Navajo spring,” below the old dugway on the west side of Comb Ridge. This spring was damaged and largely covered by the rocks that tumbled down the steep slope during the rebuilding of State Highway 47 in the spring of 1953 and would require considerable work to make it again usable."

Elsewhere, a few scattered cottonwoods are found in lower Comb Wash and in Butler Wash, and sparse pinon pines and junipers are seen on some of the sandstone ledges. Tamarisks grow along the edge of Comb Wash valley at a few places. In general, however, the vegetation of the area includes only sagebrush, greasewood, prickly pears, and other low-growing plants typical of a semiarid region. Forage plants are sufficient in both Comb and Butler Washes to supply a moderate amount of winter grazing for cattle. \n# \nThere are no towns or villages in the mapped area -indeed, so far as known to the writer not one person is now living within its borders. Until 1951 or 1952 a few Indian families lived in hogans in the upper part of Butler Wash; but at that time they were required by court decision to move to the reservation south of the river. \nThe nearest communities are Bluff, an early Mormon settlement on the river a few miles east, and Mexican Hat some 15 miles to the southwest. More varied supplies and facilities are available in Blanding, a town of some 1,200 population about 30 miles by State Highway 47 from the southeast corner of the area. For other services and supplies recourse is had to the more distant towns such as Monticello, Moab, and Cortez or to Grand Junction, Colo., some 250 miles distant by road. \nThe only main road crossing the area is State Highway 47, usually referred to locally by the briefer term “U-47.\" It begins at Monticello, where it connects with paved U. S. Highway 160, which extends northward 88 miles through Moab to Crescent Junction, located on U. S. Highways 6 and 50 and the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad, and extends eastward and southeastward 60 miles to Cortez, Colo. From Monticello, State Highway 47 runs south through Blanding and Bluff, thence west and crosses the southern part of the mapped area. Still farther southwest it crosses the San Juan River by a bridge at Mexican Hat and reaches Monument Valley, where it connects with Arizona roads leading via Kayenta and Cameron to Flagstaff on The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. By these roads the mapped area is about 140 and 215 miles, respectively, from the railroads to the north and south.

        "text": "1953 that part of State Highway 47 between Blanding and Mexican Hat was improved. It was relocated in places, widened to permit continuous 2-way traffic, and surfaced throughout with crushed rock. Particular improvements were the construction of a bridge over Butler Wash, eliminating the descent into its deep rock-cut canyon; the construction of a new dugway with much gentler grade down the west side of Comb Ridge; and just west of Comb Wash, bypassing of the former twisting route up Snake Gulch. In the fall of 1953 that part of the road from Monticello to Blanding was surfaced with “\"black top,” and a new bridge was being built over the river at Mexican Hat. \nAnother main road extends east and west several miles north of the northern edge of the mapped area. This new road, also surfaced with crushed rock, was completed in the spring of 1953. It leaves State Highway 47 at a point about 3 miles south of Blanding, runs roughly west to the Natural Bridges National Monument, and connects with the road down White Canyon to the Colorado River ferry at Hite. This road is much lower than, and an alternative for, the old road from Blanding to the Bridges, which, because of its altitude of more than 8,500·feet near the Bear's Ears is blocked by snow or made impassable by mud during much of the year. The new road descends Comb Ridge by a steep dugway down its west side (see pl. 20A), crosses Comb Wash just upstream from the Perkins Ranch, climbs the dip slope of sandstone to the top of Grand Gulch Plateau, and goes west some 15 miles to join the Bear's Ears road a few miles east of the Bridges. \nBetween these 2 main roads extend 3 dirt roads through or across the mapped area. The first and most important of these was the old “Mormon Trail\" road. This leaves State Highway 47 and runs north on the west side of Comb Wash for about 5 miles, crosses Road Canyon, and turns northwest for a few miles, where it climbs to the top of Grand Gulch Plateau. Some 25 miles farther northwest it joins the 2 roads between Blanding and the Bridges-the new low road and the older high road by way of the Bear's Ears. In the past the “Mormon Trail\" road was much used by travelers to and from the Bridges and White Canyon, because it served both as a short cut from or to the south on State Highway 47 and as a substitute for the Bear's Ears road, when impassable, for those going from or to Blanding and the north. \nJust south of Road Canyon a road branches from the “Mormon Trail\" road, crosses to the east side of Comb Wash, and runs north some 15 miles to the Perkins Ranch just outside of the mapped area. \nThe third road leaves State Highway 47 and goes up the east side of Butler Wash to a point just north of the mapped area, then turns northeast out of the wash, climbs over a divide, and drops into Cottonwood Wash where it joins the new low road from Blanding'to the Bridges. That part of the road in Butler Wash is in general passable only by vehicles with 4-wheel drive, even in dry weather; and after storms it becomes virtually impassable."

The oldest rocksthe Hermosa formation, of Pennsylvanian ageare seen in the deep canyon of the San Juan River. The next overlying formation—the Rico, of Pennsylvanian and Permian(?) age--is exposed in the same canyon walls, and its hard upper limestone layers form the surface of the uplift in the southwest part of the area. Because of the easterly dips in the Comb monocline, bands of successively younger formations are found toward the east; the youngest named formation within the area-the Bluff sandstone, of Late Jurassic age—lying nearly horizontal forms a westward-facing escarpment along the east margin of the mapped area. Recent alluvium, terrace gravels, slope wash, and windblown sand were noted at a number of places within the area, particularly along the upper part of San Juan River and in the valleys of Comb and Butler Washes; but these were not studied in detail and are not shown on the geologic map because in places they would too fully obscure the bedrock. \nThe stratigraphy is in part complicated by marked lateral variations of several formations and members in both lithology and thickness, as brought out in the descriptions of those units. The regional setting and broader relations of these strata, as well as many pertinent details about them, have been presented by Gregory (1938). Many helpful details are furnished also.by Baker (1936) for the Monument Valley-Navajo Mountain region, which approaches within 10 miles of the southwest corner of the area described herein. \nThe areal distribution of the formations is shown on plate 17. Their succession and character are summarized in the following general section."

They consist chiefy of gray cherty very siliceous limestones, interbedded with gray shale. The limestones contain some fossils, principally brachiopods and echinoid spines. The exposed Hermosa occupies roughly the lower half of the canyon wall and has the general appearance of a gray slope interrupted by harder, ledge-making layers. Its upper contact was selected as the top of a light-blue-gray sandy shale zone 15 to 20 feet thick (the upper of two such light-toned bands) just below a conspicuous ledge of tan-weathering sandy limestone about 25 feet thick.(See pl. 18A.) \n352502—56—-3"

        "text": "The beds thus exposed represent only the uppermost and minor part of the Hermosa of this region, for Baker (1936, p. 19) records an incomplete thickness of 1,020 feet farther down the river, 3 miles northwest of the Honaker Trail. \n# \n# \nLying above the Hermosa formation with apparently full conformity is the Rico formation, now classed by the Geological Survey as of Pennsylvanian and Permian(?) age. Based upon several elevation readings by Bell and Yochelson, it is estimated in this area to be about 390 feet thick. It includes numerous hard gray limestones and massive sandstones up to 10 or even 20 feet thick, interspersed with thicker zones of softer and prevailingly red sandstones and thinbedded mudstones. At its top is a thin dense blue-gray limestone with local zones of fragmental crinoid remains. This limestone is so resistant that it forms the surface of most of the domelike anticlinal upland in the southwest part of the area. Nearer the river, however, this limestone and the subjacent 130 feet of beds have been eroded, and the next resistant gray limestone (characterized by included, irregular masses of red chert) forms a wide bench and the rim of the canyon. (See pl. 18B.) In the walls of the canyon, the Rico contrasts markedly with the underlying gray slope of the Hermosa, for it has a generally red tone and a greater number of thick ledge-forming beds that give a step-and-slope profile to the upper canyon walls. As previously stated, its contact with the Hermosa was selected as the base of a tan-weathering ledge of sandy limestone some 25 fee thick. \nThe uppermost 133 feet of the Rico in this vicinity was recorded by Yochelson as follows: \nSection of upper part of Rico formation measured just north of entrenched ocbow in southwest corner of mapped area \nFeet   \nLimestone, fine-grained, light-gray, massive, resistant ; uppermost layer of Rico, forms surface of upland 2.5   \nSandstone, shaly, weathering dark red_ 5.5   \nSandstone, upper part massive, ledge-forming, weathering light tan; lower part thin bedded, shaly, weathering dark red. 13.0   \nLimestone, sandy to shaly, weathering gray- 1.0   \nSandstone, mostiy thin-bedded, shaly, weathering dark red; includes 5 or 6 more resistant layers each 2 to 3 feet thick-. 111.0 Total_ 133.0   \nLimestone,fine-grained,gray,with included irregular masses of red chert; resistant, weathers to rough surface; forms a prominent bench and the rim of San Juan River canyon."

        "text": "# \n# \nIn his report on the Monument Valley-Navajo Mountain region, Baker (1936, p. 28) states, “All the strata between the top of the Rico formation and the base of the Moenkopi formation, of Lower Triassic age, are included in the Cutler formation. $***$ The Cutler formation is divided into five distinct units, which, from oldest to youngest, are the Halgaito tongue, Cedar Mesa sandstone member, Organ Rock tongue, De Chelly sandstone member, and Hoskinnini tongue.\" Gregory (1938, p. 41) brought this usage of the Cutler formation and its five subdivisions northward across the San Juan River into the San Juan country, and it is appropriate and applicable. for the area discussed in the present report. \n# \nLying upon the Rico formation with no evident break is the basal unit of the Cutler formation, the Halgaito tongue. In the southwest sector of the mapped area, the Halgaito makes a prominent, rather bright-red zone above and curving around the arched gray-limestone surface of the Rico. Farther north, varying amounts of its upper part are seen in the several branches of Road Canyon, Fish Creek, and Dry Wash, but the lower part and the underlying Rico are not exposed. \nIn this area the Halgaito tongue is made up chieffy of hard and soft thin-bedded sandstone in layers from a foot to 10 feet thick, interspersed with thin-bedded siltstones and mudstones, of a general reddish tone. A few scattered thin beds of gray limestone and white to buff sandstone were noted. Some 10 feet above the base is a red sandstone several feet thick whose upper surface weathers into separate rounded blocks; where mounds or “islands\" capped with this layer remain on the gray-limestone upper surface of the Rico the bed viewed from a little distance has the appearance of a low manmade stone wall of piled-up small boulders. As a whole, the alternating hard and soft thin-bedded material in the Halgaito gives to its outcrops a distinct layered effect.  Yochelson noted that near the river the unit contains somewhat thicker and more resistant ledges of sandstone than it does near State Highway 47. He also recorded that south of the highway a few local lenses of conglomerate were observed. \nIn the small canyon half a mile south of Snake Gulch, near State Highway 47, the Halgaito was found to be 406 feet thick, as measured by Bell and Yochelson in the following section :"
