The MPLM was developed by Alenia Spazio S.p.A. (an Italian aerospace company) and houses the International Standard Payload Racks (ISPR) for transportation to the space station in the shuttle. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), the payload integrator of the MPLM for Mission 6A, performed the final design CLA using the M6.0ZC shuttle data for liftoff and landing conditions using the proper shuttlecargomanifest.Aleniaperformedthepreliminaryand critical design CLAs for the development of the MPLM.

        "text": "Figure 2: The Multi Purpose Logistics Module \n\nThecriticaldesignreviewcoupledloadsanalysisisusually the last time an analysis is performed before the VLA which is the last analysis before launch. The MPLM will be flown many time during the life of the space station. The MPLM can be configured in different ways, number of racks, weight of racks, location of racks in the MPLM, and location of the MPLM in shuttle. Other payloads can also fly in the shuttle's bay.Since there are many different configurations each time the MPLM flies, a mission specific coupled loads analysis may berequired. \nOnce a manifest for a mission is decided upon,a final design coupled loads analysis may be conducted.The results fromthisanalysisarecomparedto theMPLMallowablesto verifty that the racks do not over load the MPLM and the interface fittings. From the MPLM CDR CLA[2] and previous MPLM CLAs the MPLM load allowablesl3] were defined. For Mission $6{\\mathsf{A}}^{\\mathsf{I}\\mathsf{I}}$ the manifest consists of thirteen racks, (Figure 3). There are six system racks (the Avionics #3 (AV3) rack, the DC/DC Converter Unit racks #1 and 2 (DDCU1 and DDCU2), the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) rack, and the Crew Health Care Systems (CHeCS) rack) modeled by Boeing North American (BNA)/Huntsville, four Resupply Stowage Racks (RSR) and two Resupply Stowage Platform (RSP) both models provided by BNA/Houston, and the Human Research Facility (HRF) modeled by Lockheed-Martin. The test verified empty MPLM dynamic model was supplied by Alenia. The \nSpacelab Logistics Platform (SLP) dynamic model was developed by MSFC. BNADowney supplied the shuttle models tor liftoff and landing configurations and include the \"Verification Cycle” version Super Light Weight Tank (SLWT) model and the one-tie, lightweight steel case joint redesign solid rocket boosters with the modified aft skirt stiffness along with the LR5oooVseries liftoff forcing functions. \n# \nFor Mission 6A the coupled system model is a synthesis of the MPLM/rack integrated cargo element, SLP cargo element, and the shuttle dynamic models. These models are in CraigBamptoni4l reduced form. The mass and stiffness matrices for the coupled system were formed by overlaying the mass matrices and the stiffness matrices at the cargo elements/shuttle interface DoF.Themode shapes and natural frequencies used in the transient response analysis are obtained from the eigenvalue solution of the coupled system models. Modes through $\\tt35H z$ were retained for liftoff, abort landing, and normal landing coupled system configurations. \nThe general equation of motion for the coupled system model is: \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\{M_{g}\\}\\{q_{d d}(t)\\}+\\{C_{g}\\}\\{q_{d}(t)\\}+\\{K_{g}\\}\\{q(t)\\}}\\ {=[\\Phi^{*}]^{T}\\{F(t)\\}}\\end{array}\n$$\nwhere [M,], [C,], and [K,] are the generalized mass (unity), damping (diagonal [2<w]), and stiffness (diagonal [w2) matrices, respectively. [Φ\\*]T is the transpose of the coupled systemmodeshapes, $\\{F(t)\\}$ is the time history of externally applied forces acting on the space transportation system vehicle, or forcing functions, and qda(t),qa(t),q(t) are the normal mode coordinates of accelerations, velocities, and displacements,respectively. \nEquation 1 is solved using an exact solution for $q_{d d}(t),q_{d}(t)$ andq(t) at time intervalsof 0.oo5 seconds.Internal results are recovered using transformation matrices with the generalized accelerations and externally applied forces. The modal dampingterm, $\\zeta$ ,isbasedontheforcingfunctionssuppliedby BNADowney.Avariabilityfactorisappliedtotheelasticbody modestoaccountfor uncertaintiesinmathmodel andforcing function changesand cargomanifestchanges thatmayoccur prior totheverificationloads analysiscycle. \nLoad Transformation Matrices (LTM's) were used to recover thepayload loads in terms ofphysical coordinates from the generalized accelerations and externally applied forces. The recovery of MPLM/orbiter and MPLM/rack interface forces is describedintheexpression: \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\{L(t)\\}_{i/f m p l m}}&{{}=}&{\\left[F T M1_{m p l m}^{*}\\right]\\left\\{q_{d d}(t)\\right\\}}\\ {+}&{{}\\left[F T M2_{m p l m}^{*}\\right]\\left\\{F(t)\\right\\}}\\end{array}\n$$\nwhere $\\left[F T M\\mathbf{l}_{m p l m}^{\\bullet}\\right]$ and $\\{F T M2_{m p l m}^{*}\\}$ are the force transformation matrices describing physical DOF in terms of coupled system modal accelerations and externally applied forces, respectively. {qdd(t)} is the generalized (modal) accelerations, and {F(t)} is the applied force time histories, both from the solution of the transient response (Equation 1)."

Four different configurations (804.7 Kg, 544.8 Kg, 454.1 Kg, and 363.5 Kg) of the ISPR's were used. The FDLAC used specific rack configurations for the mission, (Figure 3). \n\nSince the FDCLA was run after the CDR CLA, new shuttle models were available. The FDCLA used the M6.oZC Shuttlemodel.TheShuttleliftoffmodeliscomprisedofthe \"Verification Cycle”version super light weight tank(SLWI) model, the one-tie lightweight steel case joint redesign solid rocket booster(SRB) model with modified aft skirt stiffness, the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm model, the Orbitermodel, the OrbiterDocking System(ODS) model, the Remotely Operated Fluid Umbilical (ROFU) model, the Remotely Operated Electrical Umbilical (ROEU) model, and bridge fitting models. The CDR CLA used the M6.0ZB04 Shuttle model which varied in the SLWT model, thus a different set of liftoff forcing functions was used in the analysis (LR5ooo for MPLM CDR CLA and LR500oV for FDCLA). \nDue to the different configurations of the MPLM, the integrated"
