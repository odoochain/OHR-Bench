An example is given to illustrate the simplification of this approach. The effects of geometry of the system, the direction of load, and the degree of redundancy on the probability of complete survival of parachute-like system are also studied. The results show that the probability of complete survival of three-- member parachute-like system is very sensitive to the variation of horizontal angle of the load. However it becomes very insignificant as the degree of redundancy increases. Neverthless, the three-member system is most reliable on the basis of equal volume of materials used under any load environments. As geometry is concerned, the system.designed based on the minimum weight criterion is safer than those which have the same volume of materials and equal supporting members, except for certain cases where the angle between the load and the axis of the system gets . larger."

        "text": "The objective of structural engineers is to design such a structure that none of inadmissible states will occur during its service. Because of the uncertainties in load environments and structural strengthes, an ever-increasing effort has been made toward the application of probabilistic theory in structural design. In their pioneering work, Freudenthal, Garrelts, and Shinozuka (l)\\* have presented a rational approach to the struc-. tural reliability analysis which remains as the basis for all such analyses to-date.  The state of the art of structural safety was recently summarized in a very comprehensive manner by Task Committee on Structural Safety of American Society of Civil Engineers (2). \nWith regard to redundant system, Hanai (3) discussed a three-member redundant truss with the only consideration of the structural strength being statistical in nature. Shinozuka and Yao (4,5) developed several methods to compute the transition probability for redundant systems basing on the assumption that the external load is equally distributed among the exsiting . members. Later Yao and Yeh (6,7) proposed an approach to attack trusses by considering the tensile strength criterion and the stress redistribution among the existing members according to geometrical position. The approach can also be extended to include the compressive failure criterion if the distribution function of structural compressive strength is known. MoteCarlo technique was employed by Hoshiya (8) to obtain an approximate solution for the probability of failure of indeterminate structural system. Some of the difficulties encountered in the above-mentioned approaches are counting all possible failure paths. The computation will become very complicated if'the number of degrees of redundancy increases."

On the other hand, same central factor of safety is used for both systems, the .relative volume mainly depends on the geometry. \nParachute-like systems under the vertical statistical load are studied to determine the effect of geometry and degree of redundancy on the probability of complete survival. The results are computed from Equations (7), (8), and (9), and presented in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 by plotting the probability of survival versus the relative volume or the number of members. These results show that the probable safest system is designed on the basis of minimum weight criterion. They also show that the probability of complete survival decrease as the degree of . redundancy of system $^{+}$ increases. \nSince most system will not only be subjected to vertical loads but also dominated by the action of horizontal force such as wind force, the effects of the direction of inclined force, denoted by angles u and v, on the probability of complete survival are discussed as well in this study. The system considered here is the one which is designed to resist the vertical ·force only. The probability of complete survival for .those systems with same volume subjected to inclined force are computed from Equations (7), (8), and (9), but the central factor of safety obtained from Equation (io) should be divided by the factor of $\\mathtt{C_{1}m c o s(z)}$ . The central factor of safety for each member in such a system is different from one another. The results are calculated as a function of the ratio of diameter and height, d/2h, and the number of members, m, are plotted in Figures 7 through ll. Since the load carried by each member is no longer uniformly distributed, the results as it expected show that the probability of complete survival decreases as the inclined angle u enlarges.· Neverthless, the system designed by using minimum weight criterion can not be said to be the safest system under such an environment as it can be noticeably in Figure 8, where system with $d/2h=0.8$ is much safer than the system havinh minimum volume.
