Nor did we assess cither the cxtent 1o which co-operatives embody or generate social capital or the merits of co-operatives rclativc to other organisational forms. Rather, wc uscd generic terms ste 1 as 'community groups^ and 'organisations' in the papcr to covcr a range of entities, incniding co-opcratives. This is partly bccausc social capital and cooperation can arise W 1thin many forms of organisations -- including for-profit firms and government bodies as c.1 as not-for-profit cntitics. Further, as we indicated in the paper. the papcr did not altempt to assess the mcrits of spccific policy proposals (or specifie entities) for creating or ulilising social capital. \nI t .s concerned that you thought that our analysis of the complexities of assessing social captal policics was muddled because it 'ignores the history of dialogue between coOpcratives as an organised form of capital and government.' \nW'hile we did not discuss that dialoguc, I have re-read the section and believe that the points made. while of a general nanurc, are fair and well-rcasoncd. Thc discussion docs not say that i1l i- impossible for govcrnments to create or support social capital, whether it be through su2porning co-opcratives or through other means. What it does do is highlighi the dit'culies of determining appropriate policies in this arca at prescnt, particularly given the C.\"ent state of knowledge on social capital, its sources and its effects."

        "text": "I1 ma:y be that government support for certain types of co-opcratives are onc mechanism that couid help either to crcate ncw social capital or to harness existing social capital to help meet other goals. In line with its stated scope, the paper docs not form judgements on thesc malters but instead scts out a numbcr of considerations that a policy analyst ought to consider when assessing the mcrits of such support. \nI should also point out that, as indicated in the introduction to the papcr, it was not our goal t0 assess the level of social capital in Australia. Had we sought to do so, I expcct that wc wouid indecd have cxamined the rangc and activities of formal co-operatives, along with Other voluntary and community groups in Australia. \nThat said, with the benefit of your comments, I agree that it could havc cnhanccd the papcr to have included more explicit acknowledgment of co-operativcs and mutual aid societies in the paper. We will bear this in mind in any future rescarch we conduct. \nYours faithlully \nGary Banks Chaman"
