        "text": "# \n\n# \n# \nNASA is testing concepts for a new generation of space exploration vehicles. These space exploration vehicle concepts will help future robots and astronauts explore more than ever before, build a long-term space presence and conduct a wealth of science experiments. \nRoving vehicles proved invaluable during the Apollo missions, enabling astronauts to complete almost 20 trips across the surface of the moon. With each successive mission, NASA improved the rovers' capacities, increasing the number and duration of exploration missions. \nNASA is still building on the lessons learned during the Apollo missions, and also incorporating the experiences of operating unmanned rovers on Mars. The pressurized vehicle concept called the common Space Exploration Vehicle(SEV)is currently being developed.The SEV cabin concept could be used with a flying platform for use near the International Space Station, satellite servicing and near-Earth object (NEO) missions. A wheeled chassis concept, unveiled in 2007 with an upgraded version completed in 2009, could be used for exploring planetary surfaces."

        "text": "# \nNASA plans to conduct human space exploration missions to a variety of destinations. To maximize the number of destinations NASA explores, space exploration systems must be flexible and NASA must minimize the number of systems developed. One system concept NASA is analyzing is the SEV. The SEV would use the same cabin for in-space missions (i.e., satellite servicing, telescope assembly and exploration of near-Earth object) as well as surface exploration for planetary bodies (i.e., the moon and Mars). The in-space version of the SEV would have the pressurized cabin on a flying platform and allow astronauts to stay on-site for up to 14 days. It would provide robotic manipulators to grasp objects for observation, and allow astronauts easy access to space via the suitports, to maximize their productivity performing tasks in space outside of thecabin. \nOn planetary surfaces, astronauts will need surface mobility to explore multiple sites across the lunar and Martian surfaces. The SEV surface concept has the small, pressurized cabin mounted on a wheeled chassis that would enable a mobile form of exploration. These two components could be delivered to the planetary surface pre-integrated, or as separate elements. This SEV can provide the astronauts' main mode of transportation, and - unlike the unpressurized Apollo lunar rover - also allow them to work on long excursions without the restrictions imposed by spacesuits. The pressurized cabin has a suitport that allows the crew to get into their spacesuits and out of the vehicle faster than before, enabling multiple, short moonwalks as an alternative to one long moonwalk. \nThe surface exploration version of the SEV also features pivoting wheels that enable “crab style\" sideways movement, which helps the vehicle maneuver over difficult terrain. Its tiltable cockpit provides the drivers the best possible view of the terrain ahead. Astronauts can drive the mobility chassis without the pressurized cabin, by riding in rotating turrets while wearing spacesuits. Early concepts call for an exercise bike that allows crew members to exercise while charging the vehicle's batteries. Additionally, the chassis can be used to carry cargo. The modular design allows various tools - winches, cable reels, backhoes, cranes and bulldozer blades - to be attached for special missions. The chassis can also pick up and reposition solar-powered charging stations, communication relays and scientific packages. \n\n# \n# \n· The SEV must be able to hold a crew of two, but can support a crew of four in an emergency   \n· It can travel at about 10 kilometers per hour   \n· The mobility chassis wheels are able to pivot 360 degrees, allowing it to drive in any direction   \nWeight: $3000~{\\mathsf{k g}}$   \nPayload: 1000 kg   \nLength: 4.5 m   \nWheelbase:4m   \nHeight: 3m   \nWheels: 12x99 cm in diameter,30.5 cm wide"

        "text": "One of the goals for testing prototypes on Earth is to identify the features that are going to be the most useful in space. Although not all features currently being tested will end up on the flight vehicles, the following features are being designed andconsidered: \n# \nOn the surface of the moon and Mars, travel range is limited primarily by how quickly astronauts can get back to a safe, pressurized environment in case of an emergency. During the Apollo program, exploration was confined to the distance astronauts could expect to walk back wearing spacesuits if their rovers broke down:about $10k m$ .The presence of two or more service SEVs on the lunar or Martian surface would extend that potential range to more than $200~\\mathsf{k m}$ inany direction, greatly increasing the scientific opportunities during missions. Even in the midst of challenging terrain, emergency shelter and support can be less than an hour away. \n# \nThe greatest risk to space explorers is from unanticipated solar particle events. With a heavily shielded cabin, the SEV doubles as a storm shelter. The rapidly accessible, pressurized, radiation-hard safe haven can sustain and protect exploring crew members for up to 72 hours against solar particle events, acute suit malfunctions and other medical emergencies. The radiation shielding in the SEV cabin provides protection that the Apollo crew did not have on their unpressurizedrover-orevenontheirlander. \n# \nThe SEV system's suitport concept allows astronauts to go out for a spacewalk at almost a moment's notice. The suitport will allow the crew to enter and exit their spacesuits without bringing the suit inside, keeping the internal space mostly free of dust and other contaminants and reducing wear and tear on the suits. The suitport also minimizes the loss of air inside the cabin when it is depressurized for spacewalks, extending mission durations by maximizing available SEV resources. \n# \nBy combining a pressurized cabin with a suitport, the SEV gives crew members the unprecedented flexibility of being able to easily switch between working in plain clothes or spacesuits. Although astronauts may want to exit the vehicle to take a closer look at something outside, activities requiring fine manipulation and unfettered visual access are best performed without the confines of bulky gloves and helmets.Astronauts can sit comfortably in a cabin and look at workstations or geologic formations without the continuous exertion of working in a spacesuit, which allows them better use of computers, robotic operation, maps and dialogue between crew members. The cabin can also serve as a rolling science labfor studying samples. \n# \nAllows crew members to move from the rover to a habitat, an ascent module or anotherrover. \n# \nLike electric cars here at home, the SEV will rely on batteries to travel. NASA is developing batteries that weigh less and provide more power than those currently being used in earthly automobiles. The same technology that will someday allow astronauts to see more of space could also lead tobetter, more efficient transportation on Earth. Electric commuter vehicles, off-road vehicles, transport trucks, and construction equipment may one day benefit from NASA's battery innovations."
