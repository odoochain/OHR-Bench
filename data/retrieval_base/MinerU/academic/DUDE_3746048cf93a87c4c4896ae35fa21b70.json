Graham Division of Forest Disease Research \n# \nA roadside survey to determine distribution and abundance of dwarfmistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) in the Kaniksu National Forest was completed in 1959. The survey included all ranger districts except the Noxon and Trout Creek Districts and included intermingled and adjacent alienated lands. The location and degree of dwarfmistletoe infection were recorded along a portion of the roads. The roads were traveled at about 10 miles per hour with frequent stops to examine the stands. As many roads as possible were traveled in the time available. \nContinuous observations were made on all tree species for dwarfmistletoe infection, but detailed information was recorded only for western larch and lodgepole pine. Whenever dwarfmistletoe was encountered in Douglas-fir, the approximate location and extent of the infected area were recorded (fig. l). \nDuring travel through stands containing 10 percent or more of either western larch or lodgepole pine, the degree of dwarfmistletoe infection was recorded as: \nFree Stand free of dwarfmistletoe.   \nLight Less than one-third of the trees infected.   \nModerate - One-third to two-thirds of the trees infected.   \nHeavy More than two-thirds of the trees infected. \nIn addition to dwarfmistletoe infection, stand timber type, size class, and stocking class were recorded. The definitions and specifications used for these stand conditions were the same as those used by the forest inventorysurvey."

        "text": "Comparable values for pole and seedling-sapling stands were 49 and 15 percent, respectively. This decreasing incidence of dwarfmistletoe occurrence as stand size class decreases is to be expected because the smaller trees are often of a younger age class and, therefore, have been subjected to infection for a shorter time. \nLarch dwarfmistletoe was about as common in stands of other timber types as in the western larch timber type. In sawtimber stands this tendency is well illustrated. Infection was 77 percent in the larch sawtimber type and 78 percent in other types (table 2). In pole-sized stands, however, some variation in dwarfmistletoe incidence occurred between timber types and among ranger districts. This variation is probably the result of the past history of individual pole stands. Nevertheless, the survey data indicate that infected larch poles occur about as frequently in mixed stands as in larch stands. In seedling-sapling stands, infection was highest in the larch type. However, this may not be a valid comparison. Only 1l.5 miles of other timber types weresampled. \nThe frequency of larch dwarfmistletoe in well- and medium-stocked stands (59 and 56 percent, respectively) was greater than in poorly stocked stands (42 percent). However, infection in poorly stocked stands tended to be heavier than in well- and medium-stocked stands (table 3). \nTable 3.--Frequency of total infection and heavy infection by the western larch dwarfmistletoe by stand stocking classes, Kaniksu National Forest, l959 ,Dwarfmistletoe in Lodgepole Pine \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Stand stocking class} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Total miles traveled ii infected larch} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Miles of heavily infected larch} \\\\\n & Basis & Infection & Basis & Infection \\\\\n & Miles & Percent & Miles & Percent \\\\\nWell stocked & 110.7 & 59 & 65.2 & 38 \\\\\nMedium stocked & 131.3 & 56 & 73.1 & 42 \\\\\nPoorly stocked & 58.3 & 42 & 24.2 & 51 \\\\\nAll stockings & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{300.3 54 162.5 42} \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nLodgepole pine dwarfmistletoe is not a problem in the forest except in occasional stands. Infection occurred in only 6 percent of the 153.0 miles of roadside strip traveled in lodgepole pine stands. No infected lodgepole was found in either the Priest Lake or Clark Fork Districts (table l and fig. l). The highest incidence of the lodgepole pine dwarfmistletoe (l3 percent) occurred in the Newport District."

        "text": "Stand incidence of the lodgepole pine dwarfmistletoe was approximately the same regardless of timber type. Five percent of the roadside strip traveled in the lodgepole pine timber type was infected, 7 percent of the mixed stands, and 6 percent of all stands. \n# \nAlthough no detailed records were taken on the abundance and intensity of the Douglas-fir dwarfmistletoe, infection in the species is present on the forest. Several infected areas of varied sizes were encountered (fig. l). Infection of Douglas-fir is especially severe on the east side of Pend Oreille Lake. Several infected stands occur in the northern half of the Purcell Trench and along the Pend Oreille River north of Newport. No infected Douglasfir was found in the Priest River drainage. \n# \nEstimates of the distribution and abundance of dwarfmistletoe in the Kaniksu National Forest were obtained by a roadside survey in 1959. Larch dwarfmistletoe was found along 54 percent of the 300.3 miles of roadside strip traversed in stands containing l0 percent or more of western larch. The comparable value for lodgepole pine was 6 percent of the 153.0 miles of roadside strip traversed. \nLarch dwarfmistletoe was more prevalent in sawtimber stands (78 percent) than in pole and seedling-sapling sized stands (49 and 15 percent, respectively)。 \nPoorly stocked larch stands had dwarfmistletoe less frequently but, if infected, were more likely to be heavily infected than medium- or well-stocked stands。 \nThe larch and lodgepole pine dwarfmistletoes were about as conmon in their respective timber types as in stands of other timber types. \nSeveral infected Douglas-fir stands were found scattered through the forest, particularly along the Purcell Trench from Pend Oreille Lake to the Canadian border. No infected Douglas-fir was found in the Priest Lake drainage。"
