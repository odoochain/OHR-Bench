        "text": "On the ELECTORAL STATISTICS of ENGLAND AND WALES, 1856-S.-- MEMoRANDUM with reference to certain portions of the PAPER read in February, 185S. By W1LLIAM NEwMARCH, one of the Honorary Secretaries of the Statistical Society. \nSiNcEthepublicationintheJournaloftbelstMarchlastwhich contained the Paper read before the Society on the 15th February preceding, several circumstances have contributed to draw attention to the statements and estimates I had been led to adopt; and from a varietyofquarters questionshavebeen addressed tomewithreference to various portions of the inquiry. I gladly avail myself, therefore, of the facilities afforded by the appearance of this ensuing number of the Journal, to state, as shortly as I can, the results of further investigation andevidence on someof thequestionsraised. \nDuring the last few months a large group of returns has been issued by Parliament relative to the Constituencies and the Sufrage. It has not been possible to observe any systematic course of investigation in these Returns, and hence they are, to a great extent, desultory. Still the amount of new information is large and valuable, and if carefully analysed might afford the means for finally clearing away many dificulties. At present, however, I must content myself with referring tono morethan one or twopoints. \nAmong the most important of the Parliamentary Papers are two (118/59 and 171/59) obtained by Mr. Tite, under the title of Poor Rates. The first of these (118/59), gives for each County Division (and the represented places within it)in England and Wales the number of persons assessed in 1853 to Poor Rate, distinguishing the annual rateable values of the properties assessed into twenty-one classes; and the like classification is also extended to the tenements in respect of which the owners (instead of the occupiers) were rated. To some extent the Return is imperfect in consequence of parishes, among wlich are several large metropolitan parishes, having failed to send in the needful schedules. Notwithstanding these defects, however, the Return is among the most valuable that has appeared. \nThe second Return (171/59) is a publication, in a separate form, of so much of the materials of No.118 as relate to Represented Cities and Boroughs only, but the figures given do not extend beyond the direct assessment of Occupiers, omitting the very large class of cases in which the owners are rated intead of the occupiers. Hence this second paper cannot be regarded as more than imperfectly collateral tothefirst. \nBut availing ourselves of the facts given in the Paper No. 118, we may expect to arrive, with some degree of accuraey as regards the Counties and Boroughs (combined) of England and Wales, at the total number of properties, the rateable annual value of which is represented by the scales of rateable annual value composing the return, and by means of that rateable annual value we may approximate pretty closely to the annual letting value or rent. As a general rule (but with many local variations) the gross estimated Rent may be said to be about one-sixth more than the rateable annual value to the Poor Rate. Thus a rating of, say, 5l. would represent a rent of, say, 6l. In the following Table (BB) the ratings are so arranged as to indicate, as far as possible, the three classes of House Rents of:—-(B) 10l. and above ;--(C) 6l. and under 10l. ;-- and (D) under 6l."

        "text": "In order to convert the results in this general Table (BB) into some satisfactory estimate of the number of Parliamentary Votes Which would be yielded by the three classes of Rents, a variety of corrections are required. The title of the Return 118/59 describes it as a Return of “the number of persons rated to the relief of the Poor \" in respect of property of the Annual Value of  '”  It is reasonable, therefore, to regard the return as in effect exhibiting the number of different properties or tenements (whether houses, stables, sheds, felds, workshops, offces, and the like), assessed in 1853. At present the franchise is conferred in Boroughs where there is occupancy of a property or tenement of the bona fide value of at least 10l. annual rent. The occupancy is not limited to dwelling houses, and the proposals which have been made from time to time for reducing the minimum limit have all proceeded upon the same principle of attaching the suffrage to the occupation of premises or tenements, be they dwelling-houses or properties of some other kind. To arrive, therefore, at an estimate of the number of votes to be yielded, we need not attempt any conversion of the rents of properties into rents of dwelling-houses merely.\\* But from the figures in (BB) deductions are obviously required on the following grounds, viz., (l) corrections as regards the number of female occupiers ; (2) for propertics vacant ; (3) for occupiers absent; (4) for properties held by trustecs or minors; (5) for properties held under lease or agreement for terms of insuficient length; (6) for occupiers receiving parochial relief; (7) for occupiers with more than one Parliamentary qualification in the same county or borough ; (8) for occupiers who have not resided long enough to be entitled to a vote. \nIt is also clear that some additions are required to the fgures in (BB) for:--(1) the omissions of certain entire parishes, as stated on the face of the return ; (2) the further omissions which are inevitable in so large a collection of minute facts prepared by several thousands of parish offcers in pursuance of an obligatory order which did not provideanyspecialremunerationfor theworktobe done. \nAccording to the best judgment I can form, an addition of 10 per \n\\* There is frequently no little confusion in the minds of persons who discuss questions of reform,as tothe real nature of the changes proposed,or to be considered.Household Sufrage,for example,is frequently confounded withRating Sufrage--but is obviously a much less extensive proposal.A Household Suffrage would give votes to those adult males only who occupied dwelling-houses according to some definition to be given.A Rating Suffrage would extend to all adult males who were rated either for dwelling-houses or for any other kind of tenement; and specialprovisionwouldhavetobemadeforthemorethan one million occupiers whose rates are paid by the Owners, and whose occupancy is, in a large proportion of cases, a letting from week to week, with a week's rent paid in advance."

In the case of the larger rents (B), that is of 10l. and above, in Counties and Boroughs, it is manifest that the estimate of 1,042,000 for 1859 is below the truth.

        "text": "And this leads me to refer to a portion of the February Paper, to which some attention has been drawn, I mean to Table (G), at page 112 ante,in which an effort is made to ascertain the extent of the additions which would be made to the present County Constituency by reducing the County Occupation linit from 50l. to 10l. The conclusion I arrived at in February--but as then expressly stated on grounds largely conjectural-was, that the addition would be about 108,000 votes, or equal to 20 per cent. on the present County Constituency of 502,000 votes. \nLooking, however, at the facts as now ascertained for 1853,as regards the Rents of 10l.and above, it is to my mind clear that the estimate for 1859 ought to be raised from 1,042,000 votes to at least 1,120,000 votes; or in other words, that the efect of the later and more complete evidence is to fully justify us in believing that a 10l. County Occupation limit would afford, say 186,000 votes to be added to the County Registers ; raising, therefore, the total entries in these registers from, say 502,000 to 688,000 votes, or to the extent of 37per cent. \nI have been applied to from several quarters to explain the grounds upon which I adopted in Table (M), page 118 ante,a fnal statement of the County and Borough Constituencies at the three classes of rents, very much below the total numbers which might seem to be indicated by the statements in a territorial form, contained more especially in Tables (H) and (K) :—-and I will repeat here the answer I have given to these inquiries. \nI attach so much importance to the Territorial arrangement that I spared no pains to complete the several Tables on that basis; and for groups of Counties taken in peculiar divisions or areas of country, I have great faith in the approximate accuracy of the cols. in $(\\mathbf{H})$ and (K). But when a general statement had to be made for the whole of England and Wales, I could not overlook a variety of considerations which must necessarily modify to a large extent the results affrded by the general rules which had alone been available for my guidance. It was clear, for example, that large allowances must be inade :-(l) for varying proportions of female tenants in different parts of the country ; (2) for wide variations of rating-valuation and practice;(3) for wide variations in the number of vacant houses arising from peculiarities of occupation; (4) and on the same ground for wide variations in the number of houses occupied for an insuffcient length of time; (5) for disproportions in different parts of the country in the accuracy of the materials from which the final returns were made up. For these and other reasons which will readily occur to persons who have occupied themselves in reducing into a tabular form results not wholly ascertained by actual enumeration, I felt that the reduced totals contained in Table (M) would best guard both myself and my readers against errors of exaggeration."

The Government Bill reserves the rights of the present holders of all these votes. The effect of reducing the County Occupancy limit from 50l. to 1ol. would, as we have just endeavoured to show, place (say) 186,0o0 votes at the disposal of the County and Borough Registers ; presuming the revision of Borough boundaries to be carried out. \nTothis large increase must be added the very considerable augmentation to arise from the clause enfranchisingLodgers paying 8s. per week or 20l. per annum. The additions under this clause would be most considerable in London and the largest Towns, for the obvious reason that in large Towns house-room is so dear as to compel the hiring of portions only of a house. According to the Census of 185l there were in England and Wales 3,710,000 \" families” occupying 3,270,000 houses, that is to say, each 100 houses contained very nearly 112 families,-—equal in the aggregate to an excess of 440,000 families. Since 1851 this aggregate has largely increased, but to what extent, or to what portion of the present total the Eight Shilling test may apply, I have no accurate means of judging. \nThe Savings? Bank Clause, conferring votes on depositors of 60l. or above, would admit a desirable class of voters.In 1856,in England and Wales, out of 1,142,000 depositors in Savings’ Banks .S2,000 were for sums of 50l.and above; the returns do not admit of stating the proportion at 60l. and above. From this 182,000, large deductions must be made for females, minors, and trust and deceased accounts,—-a deduction, taking the country as a whole, at least equal to one-third,—-and allowing further for the higher range of the 60l. limit--reducing the 182,000 to probably not more than 80,00o. Of this 80,000 a considerable number would of course possess votes under some of the other qualifying clauses. \nThe enfranchisement conferred on Government Pensioners of 20%. per annum and above, and on recipients of 1ol. per annum and above from money in the Public Funds and East India and Bank Stock, would no doubt admit some persons not already enfranchised as freeholders, occupiers, lodgers, or professional men. In 1857 there were 270,000 different recipients of dividends from the Public Funds of all kinds. Of this number 92,000 were recipients of annual sums of not more than 5l.,—and 43,000 of annual sums of more than 5l., but not more than 10l. There were, therefore, 135,000 cases in which the payments conformed to the suggested limit of 10l. A large proportion of these 135,000 cases would of course be represented by females, trustees, minors, and absentees."
