        "text": "# \nMONOGRAPH 1I OBJECTIVES \n# \nThe Soviets are fully aware that their penetration of interplanetary space will present unique opportunities to advance their national objectives, particularly those of a political, miitary, and scientifc nature. At this stage of their conquest of space, they probably have not been able. to formulate detailed plans along these lines, but there are indications that they intend to take full advantage of opportunities as they arise. Since there are many unknowns in space research, the Sovlets will undoubtedly fnd it necessary to reexamine their space program from time to time. \nOne of the objectives of the USSR space program which became apparent at an early date was the use of Soviet accomplishments for political propaganda purposes, especially in an attempt to convince the world of the superiority of the UssR and the Communist system and to intimidate the rest of the world by the missile capabilities implied by space successes. \nThe Soviets have been cautious in speaking of the military objectives of their space program, but they have discussed them, and it is believed that they will use space vehicles for offensive and defensive purposes and for military communications, electronic countermeasures, navigation, and reconnaissance. \n\nThe early Soviet space efforts, particularly Sputniks II and Ill, demonstrated a strong Soviet desire to advance basic science and to increase knowledge of the earth, the solar system, and the universe. In:the felds of astronomy and geophyslcs, immediate Soviet. objectives include greatly improved observations by means of instrumented satellites and probes; fundamental physical experiments have also been planned. Much of the sclentifc interest appears to result from Soviet objectives to find methods. of tapping new energy sources in space and exploiting the natural resources of the moon and planets. Some of the immediate practical objectives of the scientific program in space include improved communications; weather observations; geodetic measurements; sea-ice and polar surveys; high precision cartography; nuclear test detection, and the determination of environmental radiation hazards. \nThe principal objective of the UssR in the field of astronautics is'to place manned and unmanned  controlled vehicles  into  interplanetary space.. For manned controlled vehicles its projects concern: (a) the vehicle recovery problem; (b) space bio-medical problems; (c) protection against radiation. hazards; and (d) space environment research. For both manned and unmanned controlled vehicles, the Soviets are developing: (a) space navigation communications, guidance, control, tracking, data handling, and calculating devices and procedures;  (b) more powerful propellants and sources of power; (c) lunar and interplanetary probes, with Venus and Mars as the most probable early planetary objectives; and (d) artificial satellites for scientific, communications, and reconnaissance purposes. The Soviets have indicated that some of their current projects will lead eventually to the establishment of multi-purpose stations in space and on the moon and planets."

        "text": "The Soviets have discussed the problem of sending probes beyond the solar system into interstellar space, but there is no evidence that such a program is being seriously considered at this time. \nIndications are that the Soviets intend to continue to use the resources of the entire Bloc area in space research and possibly to encourage some high-altitude-rocket sounding programs in other leading Bloc nations. Communist Chinese reports that they will launch research rockets and artificial earth satellites probably indicate .that the Soviets are considering assisting in such a program for political and propaganda purposes. \n# \n# \nEvents leading directly to the Soviet launching of Sputniks I, II, and III and the Lunik/Mechta rocket are generaly known. Much less kmown, however, is the history of astronautics in Russia, which dates from the end of the nineteenth century, when I. V. Mescherskiy  investigated  theoretically  the dynamics of bodies of variable mass and K. E. Tsiolkovskiy began his work on the principles of rocket flight.1: Although Tsiolkovskly is usually credited by the Soviets as being the founder of scientific astronautics, several of his contemporaries also made fundamental contributions.2a In 1929, Ya. I. Perel'man, I. P. Fortikov, and other followers of Tsiolkovskiy founded a rocket organization known as GIRD (Group for the Study of Reactive Motion). Some of the papers produced by GIRD indicated & high degree of technical competence in the various aspects of rocketry and space exploration. Members of GIRD who are still very active include I. A. Merkulov, Yu. A. Pobedonostsev, and M. K. Tikhonravov. \nThe Soviet Government is reported to have organized a rocket research program in 1934, only five years after Germany had done so.5 \nThe Soviets have supported an aggressive rocket research policy since 1945. They appropriated most of the German rocket factories. and test facilities and put several hundred German rocket experts to work for them in the USSR. Subsequent developments indicate that the Soviet effort has been more than an extension of the German program and that it is based upon independent thinking and research.6 \nBy 27 November 1953, 'the Soviet program had advanced to such a point that A. N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Academy of Sciences, USSR, was able to make confidently the following public statement: \"Science has reached a state when it is feasible to send a stratoplane to 'the moon, [and] to create an artificial satellite of the earth. . . \"1 \nSoviet interest in space fight was further emphasized by the action of the Presidium of the Academy. of Sciences, USSR, on 24 September 1954 in establishing the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Gold Medal for outstanding work in the feld of interplanetary communications (travel), to be awarded every three years beginning with 1957.s The name of the first winner of the award was withheld, probably for security reasons.·"

        "text": "# \nAnAstronautics Section of the V.P. Chkalov Central Aeroclub of the USSR was organized early in 1954. Its stated objective was \"to facilitate the regulation of cosmic flights for peaceful purposes.\" Its charter members included chairman N. A. Varvarov, V. V. Dobronravov, I. A. Merkulov, A. D. Seryapin, K. P. Stanyukovich, Yu S. Khlebtsevich, and International Astronautics Prize Winner A.A.Shternfel'd. \n.In April 1955, the Soviets announced the formation of the Interagency Commission for Interplanetary Communications (ICiC) composed of outstanding Soviet scientists and engineers. L. I. Sedov, a leading hydrodynamicist, was named chairman, and M. K. Tikhonravov, who as early as 1934 designed and successfully  launched liquid-propellant atmospheric research rockets, was appointed vice chairman. One of the frst tasks assigned to the group was the creation of an \"automatic laboratory for scientific research' in cosmic space\" (an artifcial earth satellite) as the \"first step in solving the problems of interplanetary travel\" The work in the feld of astronautics is on a national scale. The ICIC acts as a coordinating committee to direct the activities of the various institutes.1o \nThe U.s. announcement of 29 July 1955 that it intended to launch an earth satellite during the International Geophysical Year (1957-58) led to much speculation concerning Soviet capabilities and plans in this feld, but the Soviets refused to disclose their intentions at that time. A short time later, on 2 August, Sedov. held a press conference in which he made a guarded statement indicating that the Soviets were working on a satellite, possibly larger 'than that of the United States, to be launched in the \"comiparatively near future.\" i1 \nAn active Soviet satelite program was conArmed on 11 September 1956 by Academician I. P. Bardin, chairman of the IGY National Committee of the UssR, during a meeting of the Comite Special de lAnnes Geophysical. Internationale (CSAGI) in Barcelona, Spain. Bardin stated that the USSR intended to launch a satellite for upper atmospheric research during the IGY, but he declined to outline the Soviet program or to disclose further details.12 \n\nIn 1956, the Academy of Sciences, USSR, applied for membership in the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) and was accepted during the Seventh International Astronautical Congress in Rome in September of that year. The Soviet's Ione delegate, L. 1. Sedov, was elected a vice president, but more than a year passed before the USSR complied with the by-laws of the LAF and submitted a description of the Academy's ICIC and a list of members.1s \nIn December 1956, the Soviets disclosed details of the extent and nature of their upper atmosphere rocket research program. This came about when a delegation of 13 scientists, headed by Academician A. A. Blagonravov, attended the frst International Congress on Rockets and Guided Missiles in Paris. Papers presented by S. M. Poloskov and B. A. Mirtov revealed some unique features of Soviet upperatmosphere research rockets, and the presentation by A. V. Pokrovskiy indicated an extensive Soviet.experimental aeromedicine program. Subsequent to the release of this information, various articles appeared in Soviet newspapers and scientific journals supplying additional information on the Soviet rocket effort. Among the significant items was the Soviet admission that rocket studies of the atmosphere had been conducted since about 1947.1415 \nThe Soviet rocket and satellite program for the IGY was outlined in a general manner in June 1957 in a letter from 1. P. Bardin to IGY headquarters (CSAGI), Brussels. The program indicated that the Soviets would fre 125 meteorological. research rockets from three different geographical zones and would place into orbit an unspecified number of artificial earth satellites.1e \nOn 1 June 1957, Nesmeyanov was quoted in the Soviet press as saying that the necessary equipment and apparatus had been created to solve the problem of artificial earth satellites.17 A week later, Nesmeyanov stated, \"Soon, literally within the next months, our"

The technical diffculties that stood in the way of the solution of this grandiose task have been overcome by our scientists.\" i8 Other indications of an impending satellite launching included announcements in Soviet astronomical and radio journals giving instructions on methods of observing satellites and receiving their  transmissions.10 20  These   indications were available to few people in Western countries. \nOn 27 August 1957, the Soviet press carried announcements that successful tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile  had  been carried out “in conformity with the plan of scientifc research work in the USSR.\"21 Then came the successful orbiting of Sputnik I on 4 October 1957, followed by Sputnik II on 3 November 1957, and Sputnik I1 on 15 May 1958. These launchings introduced the new space age and impressed the world with Soviet scientific and military accomplishments, thereby scoring a major propaganda and psychological triumph.  Sputnik Il in particular has been evaluated as a major scientiflc accomplishment.22 \nThe next important Soviet step in the space research feld was the launching of the socalled cosmic rocket on 2 January 1959. There is little doubt that it was intended as a lunar rocket, considering advance statements by Soviet newspapers and astronautical experts, the 62-hour life of the power supply, the significance 'of the. unofficial name \"Lunik,\"\\* the scientifc experiments planned, and the marker carried for the purpose of leaving evidence of the frst rocket to impact on the moon.2s-2 The Soviets were clever enough to reorient their propaganda line after it became apparent that the rocket would not strike the moon but would be drawn into an orbit around the sun by the gravitational attraction of that body. $\\cdot$ At first, some began to call it \"Mechta.\" \\*\\* Thereafter they referred to it as the frst cosmic rocket, the frst artifcial planet, and the frst solar rocket. In spite of failure to achieve its lunar mission, the rocket demonstrated that the Soviets were making progress in their space flight program. \n\n# \n# \nManned space fight on an interplanetary scale is the announced goal of the Interagency Commission for Interplanetary Communications (ICIC), of the Academy of Sciences, USSR.io Various spokesmen have repeatedly confirmed this as a principal Soviet objective.s-2  Controlled flight in vehicles capable of returning to earth is implied in the ICIC statement. \n# \nA number of leading astronautics experts, have mentioned the desirability of using unmanned controlled vehicles in interplanetary space exploration, pointing out that the use of such devices eliminates many of the basic diffculties -—- such as biological, shielding, recovery, and excessive weight problems -- encountered in manned vehicles. The development of unmanned space vehicles is expected to continue to receive a. great deal of attention by the Sovlets because thelr initial investigations of space will be conducted with such vehicles. Highly developed unmanned rockets and satellites, therefore, will be im-. portant stepping stones in the accomplishment of manned space flight and, according to some Soviet views, they will always be preferable because of cost and safety factors for certain types of space exploration. A. G. Karpenko,81 V. 1. Krassovskiy,\\*2 and Yu. S. Khlebtsevich ss s have advocated the use of vehicles of this type. The Institute of Automatics and Telemechanics, of the Academy of Sciences, USSR, reportedly is working on associated problems.88 \n# \nResponsible Soviet scientists have not encouraged the belief that fight beyond the solar system into interstellar space is attainable in the foreseeable future.

        "text": "# \nV. V. Dobronravov, who said, \"Some scientists are even thinking of space ships which will take man to.other stars of the galaxy. But this is something for a more distant future.\" 30 \n# \nResponsible Sovlet authorities recognize' that their principal astronautical goais can only be attained through a series of deveiopments, each being an important achievement in. itself and contributing in a cumulative manner over a number of years to the ultimate objectives- manned and unmanned flight by means of controlled space vehicles. 8-0  Soviet statements and recent events indicate that the space program is well underway and that current projects probably have the major objectives which are outlined in the following sections. \n# \nA practical solution to the problem of recovering satellites and other space vehicles is regarded as a prerequisite to sending humans into space, according to A. N. Nesmeyanov, L. I. Sedov, and other leading fgures. Several have openly admitted that the USSR is working on a recoverable satellite or a recoverable capsule or glider from a satellite.2e 20 s8 40 Other similar indicated objectives may include landings by winged, powered vehicles of the boost-glide type. Retardation by utiizing the resistance of the atmosphere appears to be favored, especially in the early. stages. V. V. Dobronravov apparently expressed the opinions of many Soviets in July 1958 when he said, \"It is quite possible that the frst problem will be that of producing so-called guided or recoverable satellites\" s7 t1 42 Solution of the vehicle recovery and reentry problems will result in the return of animals and later humans from experimental space fights. \nNavigation, Communications, Guidance, Control, Tracking, Data Handling, and Cal. culations \nlating devices.s Other leading authorities who have indicated similar Soviet aims to provide support to the space program include V. Dobronravov,8 I. Kucherov, L. Yanitskiy,4\" and G. V. Petrovich.29 46 \nA Soviet broadcast of 6 May 1958 stated, \"The creation of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the launching of the Soviet artifcial earth satellites were made possible to a significant degree by the admirable achievements of our radio-electronics. Applying radio-electronic methods evolved by Soviet scientists, it became possible to launch the satellites with exceptional accuracy on previously calculated orbits.\" 4? \nPublished orbital calculations and demonstrated ability to compute rapidly the ephemerides of artificial earth satellites indicate the exlstence of a Soviet objective of some priority to support the space program with adequate tracking, ground communications, and computing devices and procedures. The astronomical approach to the space navigation problem was being considered as early as 1952. \n# \nThe Soviets have made many statements indicating a long-standing objective of high priority to fnd and develop new, more powerful propellants and sources of power. Premier Khrushchev has bragged of the enormous power used to launch the Sputniks.o '.\\* Current Soviet propulsion systems appear to utilize chemical systems based upon conventional Hquid   bi-propellants. Higher-energy  fuel combinations will be required for launching significantly heavier payloads to great distances. The Soviets ·have expressed interest in fuorine, hydrazine, and boron compounds, all of which have potential applications in the development of high-energy fuels; solid propellant fuels have also received attention. Statements by K. P. Stanyukovich, V. G. Fesenkov, and others indicate high interest in nuclear propulsion.6 . 21 50 s1 is0  Plans to develop free-radical fuels and ion, photon, and other so-called exotic propulsion systems are undoubtedly being considered as part of a long-range research program.s2-s7 6o Other \n: the :tain-. f the at by \nYu. S. Khlebtsevitch has pointed to the role that radio-electronics must play in providing improved communications, guidance, control, tracking, data handling, and calcumethods, such as utilization of atmospheric energy and felds of force in space, appear to be of only secondary interest at present and probably can be classed as long-term objectives.58 59 85"

'Typical of the statements relating to this objective is that of A. D. Seryakin who, after pointing out that much detailed study of the effects of space fight on man was necessary, stated, \"One thing is certain: Soviet medicine, in cooperation with Soviet technology, will ensure safe conditions for man's life on a cosmic ship . . . 62 116 \nSoviet statements indicate that they are working on the use of algae as food for space vehicle crew members. and as the active component in a carbon dioxide-oxygen exchange system. In addition, it should be assumed that they are studying the possibilities of use of the same or similar organisms as the active agents in waste disposal systems. In the perfect closed biological system all of the waste materials, including solids, liquids, and gases, enter into the system with the regeneration of useful products. It is not anticipated that biological systems for regeneration of food and oxygen will be used in early fights of comparatively short duration, except for testing purposes. Only with long duration fights can a saving of weight and space be made through the agency of air, algal food, water, and gas cycling systems. \nSoviet astrobiological research is aimed at determining  whether life exists on other planets of the solar system. Most of the Soviet effort has been expended on a study of the possibiity of the existence of plant life on Mars. There are recent indications that some Soviet facilities and personnel formerly devoted to astrobiology have been transferred to studies of man's survival in space. It can be assumed that Soviet interest in astrobiology will continue, but probably at lower priority for the time being. \n\nSoviet interest in problems connected with the effect of the different factors of interplanetary travel on the human organism has been expressed by I. S. Balakhovskiy, V. B. Malkin, V. V. Rozenblat, Ye. Yugove (Yugov), A. Serov,. and others.so-c9 71 Ye. K. Federov stated in a press conference in Moscow on 16 May 1958 that Soviet space research with live animals will continue.70 \n# \nIn addition to lunar and planetary 'investi. gations, the Soviets plan to conduct further studies of the nature and processes of the space environment, mostly in the area of astronomical and  geophysical research, in support of the space program. This objective has been clearly defined by Soviet statements and by the rocket and satellite program to date.78-7s \nA more complete understanding of the upper atmosphere, including density, temperatures, pressure, winds, chemical composition, and ionospheric properties would be extremely. useful for space communications and for the design and operation of space vehicles. Increased knowledge of solar and cosmic radi. ation, of the earth's magnetic and gravitational felds, and of the distribution of meteors, dust, and other constituents of the upper atmosphere and space are of considerable importance to the development of a space program.7e v.sos7 With the U.S. discovery of the Van Allen belts, the radiation problem has become important in the attainment of manned space fight. Much work remains to be done in understanding the processes involved, the spacial boundaries, and variations in intensity and extent as well as in determining means of protection or avoidance of the belts."

G. V. Petrovich stated in March 1959 that Lunik was \"only the beginning of a study of the closest heavenly body to us, the Moon.\" He predicted later fights around the moon; an artificial moon satellite; 1anding of scientinc equipment on the moon's surface; and the landing of a manned rocket on the moon, possibly two manned rockets to insure safe return to the earth. He stated that a manned circumlunar fight will precede a manned earth-to-moon fight with landing on the moon. \n. Petrovich also stated that fights to the planets Mars and Venus, our closest planets, are now \"completely within reach.\" His comments indicated that exploratory trips, approaching the planets as close as possible for observation,  would be undertaken before landings are attempted.2? \nIn his opening address to the annual general assembly of the Academy of Sciences, USSR, on 26 March 1959, A. N. Nesmeyanov said “There is no doubt that such gigantic tasks as the attainment and exploration of the moon and, subsequently, of the nearest planets will be accomplished before the current Seven-Year Plan ends.8 Nesmeyanov's statement is believed to refer to the use of unmanned instrumented satellites or probes. \n\nMany other reputable Soviets have indicated plans to expiore the moon and planets, including Yu. S. Klebtsevitch. According to his statemients in December 1958, the Soviet conquest of the moon will begin within 10 years and will be accomplished in 3 stages: (1) impact with scientific and reconnaissance instruments; (2) landing of radio-controlled rockets with special apparatus and travelling tank laboratories equipped with television and other complex apparatus; and (3) creation of a permanent, manned station on the moon. ·In the third stage, preparations and provisions will be made for insuring regular trips between the moon and the earth, according to this Soviet authority on radio telecontrol.a10 \nOther well-knownSovlet scientistswhohave indicated plans for lunar and interplanetary flights include V.

Petrovich stated that Soviet space research is concentrated into three principal areas, one being the creation of a number of artificial earth satellites \"of different tonnage and purpose.\" He continued, \"First among these in a group of satellites which will provide constant observation over the whole surface of the earth and the air surrounding it. These are to be equipped with the complex scientinc apparatus, both optical and television, necessary for this purpose. . . . Further development in this area will bring about richly equipped observer satellites, real stations outside the earth, cosmic laboratories and observatories.

N. Nesmeyanov on 3 October 1958, speaking of a long-term program, mentioned the establishment of a large \"cosmic\" station which would serve as an intermediary station in space travel.ioa 178 \n# \nIt is accepted as axlomatic that the Soviets engage in a space program because they expect to advance their national objectives, especially those of a political, military, and scientifc nature. If this were not so, they would not expend the efort which they are putting into the space program. Since there are still many unknowns in space research, the Soviets will undoubtedly fnd it necessary to reexamine the various phases and time scales of their space program from time to time. A typical fnding leading to a reexamination is the recent discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts with their possible hazards to space fight. Present evidence indicates that the USSR is working on a number of problems in the space feld and will attempt to exploit each development to the utmost. \n# \nWhether by advance $\\cdot$ plan or not, the Soviets are using their accomplishments in space research as propaganda instruments (1) to convince the world of the superlority of the USSR and the Communist system, particularly in the development of science and technology and (2) to intimidate the rest of the world by the missile capabilities of the USSR as implied by accomplishments in the rocket and satellite field. \n\nThe launchings of Sputniks I, II, and III and Lunik were accompanied by prolonged and intensive Sino-Soviet Bloc propaganda campaigns. Typical of the statements following Sputnik I was that on 6 October 1957 by Kuo Mo-jo, President of the Communist Chinese Academy of Sciences, who said, \"Following the successful manufacture of the inter-continental ballistic missile, the Soviet Union again succeeds in the launching of the frst man-made satellite. These are the most precious presents to the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the great socialist revolution. They have much significance : in the safeguarding of world peace and the promotion of welfare of mankind. The Soviet Union's successes in scientifc technology since the October revolution 40 years ago has clearly  demonstrated  that  this soclalist country is the most advanced in the world. The Soviet success may be attributed to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the superior nature of the socialist system.\" 10s \nFollowing the same event, Nikita Khrushchev made the following statement, \"The United States does not have an ICBM, otherwise it would also have easily launched a satellite of its own. We can launch satellites because we have a carrier for them, namely the ballistic missile.\" 104 \nIn November 1957, following the launching of Sputnik II, A. N. Nesmeyanov made a characteristic statement, \"A second Soviet satellite has been launched into infinite space. The second satellite is carrying more than half a ton of scientific equipment. This fgure alone testifies to the extraordinary power of the rocket device which carried it. And the launching itself of the second satellite less than a month after the frst, and a second satellite which is more perfect as far as its scientifc equipment is concerned, shows that we have really entered the era of the exploration of cosmic space, that we are really rapidly progressing toward interplanetary communications. The whole world sees that the launching of the second satellite is not just a piece of luck, but the fruit of a great preparation of mature thinking, and of the perfect technology of the Soviet Union.\" 105"

No need to doubt this, for the frst rocket of this kind has experimentally risen into the cosmos and is now proudly carrying the Soviet pennant around the sun. What other proof is needed of the rocket might of the Soviet power?\" 107 \nAlthough all available evidence shows otherwise, prominent Soviet scientists have also claimed that the USSR was the frst to discover the belts of radiation now knowm as the Van Allen belts, after the principal U.s. investigator.1os This phenomenon is the most important recent geophysical discovery relat ing to astronautics, and the Soviets undoubtedly would like to assume credit for it. \nAccording to some reports, current Soviet space projects include the development of communications satellites which would solve the problem of simultaneous broadcasting of television programs throughout the world.100 There is little doubt that the Soviets are working on the problem and that, if successful, they will exploit it to the utmost for propaganda purposes. \n\n# \nIt has been stated that every vehicle invented by man has been used in warfare. It is unlikely that space vehicles will prove to be an exception, therefore it must be assumed that the Soviets will employ them for such purposes. \nSoviet officials have made very few statements relating to the military objectives of their space research and development program. Tne Soviet articles which do mention military objectives usually quote and comment ‘on statements by citizens of Western countries. These Soviet articles are always liberaly interspersed with the usual Communist \"peace\" propaganda.7e vp 8ss -s88 \nMilitary uses of satellites were considered by Major General G. I. Pokrovskiy in his article “\"The Role of Science and Technology in Modern War,\" published in 1957. He wrote, \"The development .. . has also led to artifcial earth satellites. These satellites, together with their scientific value, also have military signifcance. From them it is possible to observe the opponents' territory and to throw atomic bombs on that territory.\" 109 \nG. V. Petrovich, commenting on the Soviet Lunik/Mechta rocket, stated, “A powerful improved ballistic rocket was used to create the one-and-one-half-ton‘solar'rocket. This rocket can be used to launch earth satellites of any weight up to several tons, or to deliver loads of even greater weight to any point on the earth's surface . . .\" 'Petrovich spoke of \"satellites which will provide constant observation over the whole surface of the earth and the air surrounding.it\" as being among the frst of the Soviet objectives. According to him, these satellites will be equipped with both optical and television equipment.

During the East-West Conference on Problems of Detecting Nuclear Explosions, Geneva, July 1958, the Soviets indicated a frm conviction that the use of instrumented satellites for detecting very high altitude nuclear detonations was both feasible and desirable.11a \nIt is possible that some of the present Soviet emphasis on recovery of satellites or capsules and on landings from powered space vehicles' stems from the relation between these problems :and the delivery of bombs from space vehicles. Manned, 'powered space vehicles and $\\cdot$ space stations for offensive and defensive purposes are probable long-range Sovlet objectives. \nOther areas in which space vehicles could be used profitably include military communications and navigation. Although Soviet statements usually relate to civil applications, it is evident that the Soviets have the military communications uses well in mind, particularly the receipt by satellites of military messages and their transmission or relay to headquarters, or land, sea, air, or space forces. Intercept of enemy radio transmissions and communications would be of considerable in-- telligence value and jamming of enemy radios from satellites would be useful for. military purposes.6 98-100 \n# \nSpace research affords new and unique opportunities for scientific observations and experiments which will advance basic sclence and add greatly to knowledge of the earth, the solar system, and the universe. The Soviets have demonstrated in the early stages of the space age that they intend to use space vehicles as a means of advancing science. \nIn the field of astronomy, immediate Soviet objectives include greatly improved observations of the solar system by means of instrumented satellites and probes. A. N. Nesmeyanov, in a speech presented on 1 December 1958 relating to the tasks of Soviet sci ence in the next seven-year plan, said, \"The seven year plan for the development of sci. ence devotes considerable attention to elab. orating new means of astronomical investiga. tions both with the aid of new powerful opti. cal and radio-technical instruments and with the use of space rockets and artifcial satellites which make it possible to send instruments beyond the earth's atmosphere.\" Commenting on the signiflcance of astronomical research, Nesmeyanoy said, \"It should be noted that the very idea of controlled thermonuclear reactions arose in' studying the sources of energy of the sun and stars. To. day astronomy investigates the nature ofl physical processes arlsing in outer space in conditions which still cannot be reproduced in laboratories on earth (super-high pressures and temperatures, super-powerful processes of energy emission, etc.).: Of great interest for astrophysics is also the problem of the generation of cosmic particles whose energy is millions of times greater than the energy of particles now obtained with the aid of the most powerful accelerators.' 11s  Nesmeya nov's remarks and those of other Soviet scientists not only indicate a purely scientifc interest but hint at a Soviet objective to tap new energy sources in space and to exploit the natural resources of .the moon and planets.50 62 86 \n\nSoviet astronomers, biologists, physicists! and geophysicists have expressed the inten tion to conduct fundamental research in space.9 70 76 80 82 88 V.

In such a case....the satellite must be ioriented! in relation to the earth; i.e., its axis must at all times maintain in cosmic space the same position in relation to the earth... This .satellite must hot rotate on its owm axis. When it is at . point A apogee/, .the power can be turned on for a brief period, and the sateillte will come closer to the earth. The propulsion power can also be used as breaking power...\" \n: Another sour ce quoted Professor Dobronravov, on 3 October 1958, as follows,\"At the present stage, the most logical thing would be construction of satellites which can return to earth. Such satellites vould make it possible to receive the results of observations not only in radlo signals but also recorded on tapes and film. Important biological experiments could also be carried out. Scientists would be able to send animals into outer.space, lmowing that they could come back safely.\""
