This slab is also the most important from the point of view of both weight and attenuation. Other slabs are then adjusted to give the same value.

This experiment is designed primarily to determine the activation of sodium in a secondary coolant cycle for the case in which the liquid metal duct constitutes the primary neutron path from reactor to heat exchanger. Since this is of immediate interest to the KAPL submarine reactor project, that organization will supply the duct mock-up. Measurements may be made with the liquid metal duct empty as well as full, to check simple duct theory. In addition, the effect of varying the wall material from boron carbide to water will be investigated.

As'a first step in the analysis of existing data on lead-water.and iron-water systems, effective absorption cross sections for lead and iron are being deduced from the experimental attenuation curves. A preliminary value of 3.8 barns has been obtained for lead, but further geometric corrections will probably reduce this value somewhat。 \nHeat Generation in Shields (T. Welton). Some simple calculations have been made of the heat sources in the reflector and shield of atypical reactor. The general conclusion reached is that a steel reflector, of three inches thickness and cooled by reactor coolant, can be followed almost directly.by thermal insulation and a hydrogeneous layer without dissipating more than one percent of the reactor power in the hydrogeneous layer. Detailed considerations are presented in a memorandum, ANP-5015, entitled Distribution of Heat Sources in Reflector and Shield. \nShield Calculations (K, Keyes). The methods of shield computation devised during the summer by members of the TAB are being checked and extended with the aim of placing at the disposal of design people a flexible and reliable recipe for calculating shield weights. It is hoped that such computations can also give effective guidance in some phases of the lid tank program. \nLarge Air Ducts in Shields.(W. K. Ergen\\*). 'A memorandum (CF 50-8-1) was written while the TAB was in session. It was intended to summarize the presently available information on the shielding for the air cycle. The main difficulty is the decrease in shield efficiency due to the enormous air ducts. Shielding considerations cannot eliminate the air cycle because there are numerous ways (some of which were listed) to circumvent the shielding difficulties, but each of these ways would introduce undesirable features into the air cycle and make it less competitive.: \nThree theoretical approaches to the duct problem are available: the \"distributed density approach,\" the \"line of sight approach,\" and the following of neutron histories including those which involve scattering. All these approaches yield essentially lower limits for the shield weights, but these limits are different for these approaches and increase in the order given above. The first two approaches have been used at NEPA and gave widely different results, mainly because of different engineering assumptions, and only secondarily because of the difference in estimation of the influence of the ducts."

        "text": "No practical way of gamma shielding the air cycle reactor has been proposed and it appears that the shield weights would be prohibitive, even if only partial gamma shielding at the air cycle reactor were attenpted. \nThe necessary large air planes of the air cycle allow the use of ${\\dot{\\pmb r}}^{\\pmb2}$ attenuation, but this aggravates the problem of neutron-induced activity in the material surrounding the reactor. \n# \nW. M. Breazeale and J. L. Meem \nThe work on the building and pool is well underway.. The contractor now expects to be out of the building by Cctober 20. Laboratory employees will then move in and install the reactor, measuring equipment, etc. Instrument development for this facility is a joint effort between NEPA and ORNL. \nA schedule (CF 50-9-16) has been drawn up covering the installation and initial \"shake down\" period totaling three and a half months. After this a mock-up of the first shield will be tested. Design and construction of this mock-up will be started when the ANP Shielding Board finishes the preliminary design of an aircraft shield (0ctober l6). \nThe neutron camera discussed in the last quarterly report has been built and tested with U23s fission spectrum. The results are in accord with the Los Alamos experience. A coincidence circuit.has been added to the proton recoil counter(2) which substantially reduced the background. The flux ree quired for satisfactory operation is still large, about $\\boldsymbol{10^{4}}\\enspace\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\$ \nA large NaI-TlI crystal has been received by P. R. Bell and is being incorporated in a scintillation spectrometer which he will test. It is hoped that the resolution and sensitivity will be sufficient so that similar equipment can be used in shielding work. A Compton recoil coincidence spectrometer has been built and bench tested. Inherently its resolution is not as good as the crystal spectrometer."

The building was turned over to the operating staff on August 2l, l950, and experimental equipment is now being installed. Operations will commence sometime in October unless the procurement of essential experimental materials, such as graphite, beryllium, and uranium, causes a delay. \nEach assembly of fissionable :and moderating material will be made in a supporting grid of square aluminum tubing. A sample section of sixteen tubes welded together has been received but preliminary tests showed that excessive warping was introduced in the welding. It appears necessary that the matrix be built with individual tubes held in place by an external frame.. The required aluminum tubing has been received. Control and safety rods have been ordered and are scheduled for delivery early in October. \nIt has been agreed that among the early experiments will be an investigation of heavy metals as reactor reflectors. Specifications have been prepared of Type 3l0 stainless steel requirements in order to completely enclose the core by approximately eight inches of reflector. \nA report, Initial Program of ANP Critical Experiments (NEPA-1522), was issued stating details of the first experiments and some of the techniques to be used."

        "text": "# \nH. W. Savage, ANP Division \nAs mentioned in the last ANP Quarterly Report, a new group of the Laboratory has been organized to do experimental engineering work for the ANP program. It is the function of the Experimental Engineering Group to develop the technology of large-scale handling of the coolants of the aircraft reactor, and to make mock-ups and engineering studies of the proposed components. It is intended that the fundamental research and initial development on all such matters as fuel elements, materials for containing corrosive liquids, and heat transfer properties of materials will be done by the other groups of the project whose work is described elsewhere in this report. The Experimental Engineering Group will take the basic information and design suggestions and will reduce them to engineering practice for the ARE. \nPresent personnel with the Experimental Engineering Group number l9, of whom four are technicians and the balance professional. Several additional technicians are to be added in order to permit 24-hour operations when necessary. During the past three months, attention has been directed principally toward program definition, laboratory installation and personnel acquisition. However, a few liquid metal loops have already been operated: \nBecause a primary requirement of the ARE is to establish the compatibility of materials, the experimental program is being carefully coordinated with the research programs of the Metallurgy Group, the Heat Transfer Group, the activities of the ANP General Design Group, and the corresponding activities of NEPA. All.of the present work is devoted to establishing the compatibility of various metals with sodium and lithium over a range of temperatures reaching somewhat above $1500^{\\circ}\\mathbf{F}$ \n: The subjects which will be considered in the course of the development of the project are listed below. Manyof these tests will be of actual components oftheARE. \n1. Heat transfer--specific configurations (not fundamental).   \n2. Hydrodynamics --free convection, pressure and velocity distribution, etc., header geometry, dynamic loads, etc.   \n3. Chemistry--corros ion, erosion, solubility."
