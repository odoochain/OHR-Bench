Mulholland,Consulting Engineer,who submitted a report(1946)proposing a combinedweir andbridgeat142.6milesalmostimmediatelyupstreamoftheexistingtimberbridge.His proposalincludedthealternativesof aweirllfeethightoprovidefortownsupply onlyor aweir i8feethighintendedtoimpound somewaterforirrigation also.TheCouncilpressedforthe adoptionofthissite,notwithstandingthatthelevelofthestreambedwaseightfeetlowerthan at site A,because it was a convenient place for the road crossing and providing a permanent lake infrontofthe town,even though there maybe some pollution by drainage therefrom. Subsequent surveys showed that,for the same crest level,a weir at thenew site compared favourablywithrespect tostoragecapacitywith one atsite A.As a resultof discussion between theCo-ordinator-General ofPublicWorks and thepartiesinterested,itwas decidedto buildacombinedweirandbridgeatthe142·4milesite. \nTheweirhasnowbeenbuiltatthe142.6mile siteby theIrrigation andWaterSupply Commission toa design prepared by it.In itspresent condition theweir has a maximum height above the stream bedof18feetand impounds 3,900acre feetof water.It will be possibletoincrease thestorage capacityto7,450acrefeetbytheinstallationofmovable crestgates whichwillraisethepondlevelbysixfeet. \nThere wasnotavailable any satisfactory experience uponwhich to base aninvestigation into the economics ofsmallisolatedirrigation areasinthedrierpartsof theState,and asstated by the then Premier,theHonourable E.M.Hanlon,M.L.A.,at theinaugural ceremony on 28th April,1948,the building of the weir-thefirst of its kind in the westwas somewhat of an experiment to discover towhatextent thebenefitsof irrigation canbe broughtto thewest."
