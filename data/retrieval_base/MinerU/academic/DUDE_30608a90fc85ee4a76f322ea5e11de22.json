Jaisalmer is situated about 18 kmsto its north-east.erit \nThe author with the late Mr. Rajiv Sharma undertook an exploration of the site in September 1993, followed by a survey conducted during March 1995, a brief report of which was presented at the ASHA session at Kurukshetra in 1995, entitled “Surveying a 17th-18th Century Settlement in the Rajasthan Desert-Kuldhara, District Jaisalmer.Later,in November 1995,another field-trip was made to the site in order to study a number of minor inscriptions which abound in the area. The present paper is based on these surveys and findings. \nAligned in a north-south direction $842\\mathrm{~m~}$ longand $261\\mathrm{~m~}$ wide), the site of Kuldhara (KLD) is longitudinally divided by five roads (R), three of which (i.e. RI, Rll and RIll) are comparatively wide and run the entire length of the township (see Plan I and II). Horizontally KLD is cut through narrow lanes (L) which connect one road with another (see Plan Il). On RII, RIlI, RIV, open spaces or chauk are also encountered.4 The whole township revolves around an almost centrally located temple which appears to be dedicated to Mother Goddess (see Plan IV). The township has a total of around 410 structures,residential and administrative, which line both the right (A) and left (B) sides of the roads (see Plan I). The remains of a citywall areonlyencountered towardsthenorth and thesouth. Towards the west, the back-walls of the structures and the riverbed appears to have taken care of the defence. The eastern side of the township facing the dry-river bed of Kakni, appears to be open. \nLakshmi Chand,the authorof Tawarikh-iJaisalmer,informsus that Kuldhara village was first settled by a Paliwal whose name was Kadhan. A tank (talao) named Udhansar at Kuldhara was also dug by him.° According to the same author, the Paliwal Brahmans were"

        "text": "Although the Paliwals were the Kanaujiya division of the PanchGaur sub-caste of the Brahmins,2 yet the cenotaph inscriptions mention neither the term ‘Paliwal' nor ‘Gaur'. However, what appears clearly from these inscriptions is that the settlers at Kuldhara from its establishment, down to its desolation in the 19th century were invariably Brahmins (Vrahmans, Vaman). In a number of inscriptions (see Appendix A) the term which appears is“Kuldhar” or “Kaldhar\". This term is sometimes preceded by the term “jati.26 In one inscripton the caste described isVrahman Kuldhar jati Mudgal (i.e. Kuldhar Brahman, sub-caste Mudgal).27 In yet another,the description is“Vrahman Govindni jati Kuldhar Loharthi.28 (Brahman Govindni, the sub-caste of whom is Kuldhar Loharthi). \nFrom this it would appear that Kuldharwas the name of a sub-caste of the Paliwal Brahmins,who being the chief settlers gave their caste name to the setlement itself.29 The other sub-castes (jati) of the Paliwal settlers at Kuldhara,as mentioned in the cenotaphinscriptions,3oare :nit \n1.Harjal 5.Jisutiya 9. Saharan   \n2.Harjalu 6. Loharthi 10.Jag   \n3.Harjaluni 7. Lahthi 11:Kalsar   \n4.Mudgal 8. Lakhar 12.Mahajalar \nSome of the inscriptions also mention the gotr of the Brahmin settlers ofKuldhara, viz: \n1Asamar 2.Sutdhana 3.Gargvi4.Gago \nOne inscription also mentions the kul viz.Gonali of a Brahmin settler.32 Among the non-brahmins we find mention of two Sutradhars (architects) iz. Dhanmaga3 and Sujo Gopalna.34 \nFrom these inscriptions it also appears that theseKuldhar Brahmins invariably married women of their own caste.35 However the jati of thehusband andwife would mostly differ. Thus a Brahmin whose jatt was Kuldharmarred a woman whose jtt was Harjalu.36 Another Brahmin who was of Mudgal jati and Sutdhana gotr married a woman who was a Brahmin of Lahthi jati.37. \nDuring the course of our survey three cremation grounds viz. Cl, C2 and C3 (see Map I & plates (a) & (b) were located. Interestingly, although the earliest and the latest cenotaph-stones were located in C2 (which also appears to be the largest of the three), Cl appears to have a wider representation of jatis, In Cl we find the centoaphplatform ofa certain Brahman Narain who was a\"dehlioragriculturist.38 In C2 there is the cenotaph of a person designated \"Mahajal Lalan\" (Caretaker of the lake/tank). Can we thus explain CI to have been the cremation ground of the richer traders and agriculturists and C2 to be that of the bureaucratic class?A study of the three cremation grounds does reveal some sort of socialstratification among these Kuldhara settlers.A majority of these cenotaphs are in the shape of a pillar erected from the ground. Theselstones are about3 to 4 ft in height and adornedwith the sculpture in relief of a male anda female deity.A fewareadormed with either a male or a female deity.However in C2 one encounters a number ofvery tall pillars,about 10 ft high whichinvariablyhave only a male deity adorning their crown. Then we have a third category, which again is sizeable. The cenotaph stone in this case is raised on top of a square platform,The platforms are around 2.5 ft high and 5 to 8 ft in length and breadth. At C2 however one encounters quite large platforms. Yet another type of deudlis are in the form of chhatris or square kiosks with a pyramidal roof on top of square platforms. One encounters five chhatris at Cl and two at C2.At C3 we have only one such chhatri. The ast type cfa depali is in the form of a miniature temple with a pillar inscription having the idols placed inside it.The stone of the cenotaph-pilar in such a deuali is of a better quality. In CI we have three such deualis, whereas in C3 we have only two. One such deuali at cl and Ill respectively hasa different kind of idol. The crown of thepillar is divided into two panels.In one panel stand two females with faded hands, while in the second panel in C3 a male stands besides a platform on' which sits a female with the prostate body of a male. In the second panel in the temple-devali in Cl a female stands besides the platform on which sits a male with a prostrate body of a male.[seeplate (c）l.drtes2cl asvisbiv"

His subjects, including the warriors, were also mostly Brahmins. In Cl one of the miniature-temple devalis,which has two panels, occurs the name of a Kuldhar Brahmin of Mudgal jati and Asamar gotr. He died in Samvat 1777 (AD 1720). Was he, in the tradition of his ancestors in 13th century Pali, the headman of his community at Kuldhara? \nFurther light on social-stratification is thrown when we look at their residential structures.If one takes the material of construction into account then one can categorize the structures in three categories:yni dsidy dgd fi otnodncisle lisi yioyhotoduue (a) Those which are constructed with stones rubble of the locally available fine-grained buff and yellow sand-stone.

It is possible, however. that failure of underground water supply might have been to blame.When the township was flourishing during the 17th & 18th centuries, there were at least five wells, two deep-wells and a massive baoli. In 1815 mostof the wells had dried up. During the present century,although there are a few settlements nearby,yet the source of water is not a well but the stagnant water in some portions of the river bed.As the watertable went down and the sources of irrigation dried up, the productivity of the soil kept on diminishing.The state maintained its demand at theprevious level.The Paliwal cultivators and traders would thushavehad little choicebut to abandon Kuldhara and migrateelsewhere. \n# \nRajivSharma.Lecturer in History.AMU.was actively involved in the Survey of thePaliwal Settlements inJaisalmer alongwith the present author.   \n2.： TheSurvey conductedwasunder theaegis of the Centre of Advanced Study in History.
