        "text": "# \n# \nCorrections agencies, government leaders, legislators, and advocates across the country are rethinking the role of segregation (also known as solitary confinement or restrictive housing in U.S. prisons and jails. A growing body of research finds that segregation—where people are held in a cell for 22 to 24 hours per day, with limited access to programming, treatment, and meaningful human interaction—can have detrimental physical, neurological, and psychological effects on incarcerated people, is harmful to correctional staff, and is counterproductive to the safety of correctional facilities and the community. \nAs part of sweeping justice reform efforts, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (LADOC) joined the national movement to reduce and eliminate segregation in U.S. prisons and jails and center correctional practices in human dignity. With this commitment in mind, in 2017 LADOC applied for technical assistance from the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) and was chosen to participate in Phase I of a project to reform their use of this practice, the “Safe Alternatives to Segregation Initiative.” This work continued in 2019 and 2020 in Phase II, the “Safe Prisons, Safe Communities: From Isolation to Dignity and Wellness Behind Bars” project. Through these initiatives, the department committed to reducing their use of segregation, transforming living conditions for incarcerated people, and striving to eliminate segregation in its current form. \nLike other systems, LADOC continues to battle with the consequences of a high incarceration rate, limitations on staff and resources, and unforeseen challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the progress the agency has made to date, coupled with a clear direction for future reforms, described below, Vera hopes the department can make significant progress and continue the path to a segregation population of zero. \n#"

        "text": "# \nIn 2019, as part of the Safe Prisons, Safe Communities inititaive, the LADOC committed to further reduce the use of segregation by 25 percent, eliminate its use for specific vulnerable populations, reduce the length of time people spend in segregation, improve conditions in these units, and address any racial and ethnic disparities in the system’s use of segregation. \nThe department has made notable progress towards these goals and helped improve conditions for incarcerated people in some of the system’s most restrictive living areas. \n# \nThe Behavior Management Dorms at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center and Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) provides opportunities for people in segregation to transition into a dormitory setting. The program begins with an orientation in a separate living area. The 45-day program offers a full schedule of peer mentor-led programming by other incarcerated volunteers. People in the unit recreate, eat meals, and participate in programming together. At the end of their programming, participants graduate, receive a certificate, and move back to the general population (GP). After 90 days in GP with no write-ups, they receive 180 days of good time, and their restrictions (such as visitation and phone) are wiped from their record. Mentors are also present in specific GP areas to serve as a resource and reinforce the lessons learned from behavior management programming. At Elayn Hunt, this programming can be combined with the facility’s 45-day Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). \nAt Angola, leadership implemented changes to the conditions of confinement for people sentenced to death. The death row unit now offers more time out-of-cell, congregate activity, recreation, and programming. Notably, according to a Vera survey in 2018, feelings of safety for incarcerated people and correctional staff in the unit have not decreased. \nThe Phoenix Pilot is a drug abuse treatment unit at Elayn Hunt, launched in November 2019. Instead of going to traditional segregation, placement in the program offers a programming opportunity for incarcerated people with multiple drug offenses in a GP environment. \nThe Closed Cell Restriction (CCR) Dorm at Angola provides a stepdown from CCR celled units in which conditions are similar to segregation. Freedom of movement is much great in these dorms, ability to congregate with others is available, and programming is provided. Many people have transitioned from the CCR dorm to GP."

This action significantly reduced the department’s capacity for segregation and symbolized a step towards change for incarcerated people, correctional staff, advocates, and other community leaders. \nIn early 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the department decided to temporarily re-open Camp J as a strategy to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. According to Secretary LeBlanc, over six months, Camp J housed 350 incarcerated people from Angola and neighboring parish jails. By November 2020, systemwide cases of COVID-19 declined significantly from their peak in early spring, and the department shut down operations of Camp J once again. Despite the unforeseen re-opening, department leadership remains committed to never using Camp J for segregation again and is exploring options to create therapeutic communities for incarcerated people in need of specialized programming such as residential substance abuse treatment. \n# \nIn summer 2018, LADOC began piloting a new disciplinary matrix to reduce the lengths of stay in segregation, increase consistency, and provide incarcerated people with knowledge of eligible sanctions for specific rule violations. LADOC began the pilot at Elayn \n\nHunt and has since piloted it at all of the major facilities. The new matrix limits disciplinary segregation for Schedule A low-court rule violations (e.g., disobedience, disorderly conduct work offenses, abuse of radio/tape CD or electronic media player). It instructs staff to defer hearings for these offenses to the high court when disciplinary segregation is considered. Long-term segregation is still an eligible sanction for the more serious Schedule B high-court violations (e.g., defiance, aggravated disobedience, escapes, fighting, intoxication, property destruction, all sex offenses, theft, etc.). Though the new matrix is a step in the right direction, the department can make several improvements. \nAs of 2019, response to the pilot from correctional staff had been positive. Incarcerated people at Elayne Hunt who provide counsel to others during disciplinary proceedings told Vera that the pilot increases the processes’ legitimacy. People are more aware of what sanctions the disciplinary board can give ahead of their hearing. They also note that people are serving much shorter sanctions and leaving segregation more quickly than usual. The department is finalizing the pilot’s regulation and updating the current segregation policies."

        "text": "# \nIn October 2018, Vera led a learning trip to Germany and Norway as part of Vera’s “Reimagining Prison” initiative, attended by Chief of Operations Seth Smith. The study tour brought participants to \nthe Northern German states of Hamburg, Berlin, and Brandenburg, then to Norway. The delegation visited seven prisons and, in Berlin, observed a criminal court proceeding and held discussions with judges and prosecutors. The trip also included visits to a concentration camp and the Holocaust memorial to put into historical context the commitment to human dignity after World War II. \nIn October 2019, Vera coordinated another learning trip to Norway, attended by Secretary James LeBlanc, Dep. Warden Tracy Falgout (Angola), and Warden Tim Hooper (Elayn Hunt). The digital news organization, NowThis also documented the trip in a short documentary-style video. Attendees visited Halden Prison and Ila Detention and Security Prison, where they witnessed the Norwegian prison system’s principles of human dignity, normality, dynamic security, and reintegration into the community at work. These principles create drastic differences in Norway’s prisons’ operations compared to those in the United States and sparked conversations between participants about what principles and strategies they could adopt and incorporate in their facilities. \n# \n国 Louisiana is one of several jurisdictions that provided data for three surveys. Of the responding jurisdictions, Louisiana had the largest reduction in its use of solitary confinement of any single jurisdiction. In September 2020, Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) and the Arthur Liman Center for Public Interest Law at Yale Law School released “TimeIn-Cell 2019: A Snapshot of Restrictive Housing”—a comprehensive analysis of national data on the use of segregation in 39 state correctional agencies in 2019. According to the epartment’s self-reported data of people in restrictive housing—defined in this survey as anyone held in their cells “for an average of 22 or more hours per day, for 15 or more continuous days”—LADOC has seen major reductions. In 2015, the department reported 2,689 people in restrictive housing—14.5 perecent of the total incarcerated population. In 2017, that number rose to 19.0 percent or 2,709 people. In summer 2019, the department reported that they held 4.8 percent or 679 people within their population in the restrictive conditions above. \nThis data shows progress towards reducing the number of people held in highly restrictive housing units for long periods. Notably, the CLA-Liman data for Louisiana does not capture data regarding: people in segregation for less than 15 days; people held in conditions short of restrictive housing—in other words, in their cells for most of the day but less than 22 hours; women in segregation; and people housed in  parish jails— who make up nearly half of those in LADOC custody—who were held in segregation."

However, there are remaining reforms that the department can undertake to achieve the above goals. The following recommendations provide steps for the LDPSC to eliminate the use of segregation. \n\n# \nFacilities are experiencing backlog where people cannot be moved out of segregation units due to bed space issues. LADOC has already started this work by converting some celled units into stepdown units with greater out-of-cell time, congregate activities, and group programming; these units can be used as models. Celled units can also be repurposed to regular general population units, with similar conditions to GP dorms. Doing so will help alleviate crowding in GP dorms, reduce the system's overall segregation capacity, and provide supportive settings tailored to the needs of different groups of incarcerated people. \nEliminate the use of segregation for particularly vulnerable ! populations—including women, youth under 18, and people with serious mental illness—and expand mental health services. \n$>$ Improve mental health treatment access, increase mental health staff. \n$>$ Eliminate the use of segregation for people with serious mental illness and create specialized treatment housing units--improving upon the current unit at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center. Alternative units for people with serious mental illness should never limit meaningful access to medical care, programming, exercise, social interaction, or communication with loved ones. \n$>$ Eliminate self-harm as a disciplinary infraction and provide clinical responses to people who engage in this behavior. Remove the provision in the department rule book that allows sanctioning people for “directly or indirectly threatening to harm oneself (except obvious suicide attempts)\" (Rule #3o-B) and \"self-mutilation\" (Rule $\\#19.$ ) as an infraction. The response to people who wish to or engage in self-injurious behavior should be a mental health assessment and treatment, not loss of privileges, forfeiture of good time, cell confinement, and especially not disciplinary segregation. \nDivert young adults (ages 18 to 25) from segregation and create a specialized residential program for this population. \nUse the future re-opening of a Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women as an opportunity to accomplish the following: \nlimit the physical capacity for segregation cells;   \ncreate appropriate treatment and programming spaces;   \n: convert cellblocks originally intended for segregation into rehabilitative settings tailored to incarcerated women's needs;   \nenact a new gender-specific disciplinary matrix; and   \neliminate segregation for women."

        "text": "# \nA large part of Vera’s technical assistance to the LADOC included administrative data collection and analysis. Vera published an extensive review of LADOC 2015 to 2016 administrative data and analysis of 2017 to 2018 policies, practices, and qualitative research in “Safe Alternatives to Segregation: Findings and Recommendations for the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, and Progress Toward Implementation.” \nThe department was unable to provide centralized data for the “Safe Prisons, Safe Communities” project in 2019 to 2020. Monitoring the impact of reform efforts is central to ensuring the department is meetings its goals and that reforms are successful at improving the lives of people who live and work in Louiaiana prisons. A key component of monitoring is the analysis of administrative data. For example, to understand the impacts of the disciplinary matrix, it’s important to know if people are now spending less time in segregation, and if people are being released back to GP at the end of their disciplinary segregaton sanction. \nTwo major facilities, Louisiana State Penitentiary (LSP) and Raymond Laborde Correctional Center (RLCC), did provide Vera facility-level data on the total segregation population, the different types of segregation, and backlogs in segregation. This data is in no way a reflection of segregation across the system, nor is it an indication that either facility is the best or worst in the system regarding their segregation population. This facility-level data did provide insights and context for our recommendations. \nVera was provided extensive access to incarcerated people and staff to conduct the largest scale survey on segregation in any prison system. In summer and fall 2019, the Vera team conducted a comprehensive survey of everyone housed in segregation, distributing and collecting surveys cell-to-cell for incarcerated people, and distributing surveys to staff who work in segregation. The surveys asked questions on conditions of confinement, safety, health and well-being, and views on segregation. The team collected over 1,300 completed surveys from incarcerated people, and nearly 250 completed surveys from the correctional staff at David Wade Correctional Center, Dixon Correctional Institute, Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola), Rayburn Correctional Center, and Raymond Laborde Correctional Center. The results of this survey will be published in future research articles. \nVera encourages the department to actively monitor and assess the impact of their reforms. Collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data on segreagtion, and having this information available and centralized at the department’s headquarters, would allow LADOC and facility-level leadership to evaluate the implementation of various pilot programs or how the new disciplinary matrix is being utilized. Importantly, this data could then be used to generate quarterly reports to agency leaders and the general public, who could use this information to further assist the LADOC in its segregation reform efforts. Key performance metrics have been provided to the department."
