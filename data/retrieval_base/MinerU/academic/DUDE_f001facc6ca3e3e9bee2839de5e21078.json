        "text": "NOTES ON \n# \n# \n1. Purpose of this Work.—The following otes are intended for nurses who, having already received training in general medical and surgical work, are entering gynrecological wards. A11 acquaintance with the ordinary literature of nursing is presupposed throughout. To supplement not to supplant other works is the author's intention. Those who seek further information on the care of the sick in general will do well to consult such manuals as those of Dr. Cullingworth or Dr. Laurence Humphry, and others. \nNothing is more unsatisfactory than to have to qualify and be responsible for the performanice of duties which are undefined or unknown. As a student and tcacher, the authior has proved how much time may be lost in finding out what has to be learned or to be taught. Experience as resident medical officer at one hospital for wonen, and as honorary surgeon to another, has led him to feel that a nurse vho enters a special hospital will be materially assisted by a concise accouunt of her new duties; and as he is not aware of any publication which cxactly mcets this requirement in regard to gynecological work, he has attempted to supply the want in the following pages."

In other hospitals however, where there is but a single resident officer, or no resident staff at all, in private nursing homes, and in cases 1m private practice, it is often a great convenience to the surgeon to be able to devolve such duties upon a competent nurse, and such a course is often very acceptable to the patient. Nurses, too, often stand ini necd of guidance in emergencies where no immediate skilled assistance is available."

Granting the fundamental principle that a nlrse only exercises her skill under authority and in dc. cordance with instructions, there need be no narrow limit to the extent to which her skill is developed. As a matter of fact, a nurse who is already able to apply a roller bandage to the leg or scalp, or to pass a catheter sans voir, can readily be taught to give a hypodermic injection, to wash out a bladder, to pass a vaginal speculum, and remove a Hodge's pessary. In many such matters a nurse will soon be decidedly ahead of the average three-months clinical clerk or dresser. \n2. Gynacological Cases Defined and Classified.—Gynaecology means the study of the diseases peculiar to women. It does not include tlie eonsideration of labour, and the lying-in or puerperal state, which are included in the  terms  midvifery 01 obstetrics. The cases whiehoccupy the gynccological nurse are :—-"

To these will be added in inost hospitals certain disorders of the bladder and lover bowel, and perhaps of the breast also.  Much care and patienee in the carrying out of iminor local measures will be required here. \n(b) A series of most inportant operations involving abdominal section, such as orariotomy,oophorectomy,abdomineal lhysterectomy, together with eertain serious operations perforined through the vagina, sueli as caginail hysterectomny, and renoval of tumours from within the womb. No operations in surgery require more incessant care and vigilance in the preparation and after-treatment, or more conscientious obvance of the eonditions of surgical eleanliness than these. \n(c) A series of plastic operations, or operations for repair, such as thiose  for ruptured perineum and vesico-vaginal fistula. In these almost everytling depends upon securing union by first intention, and here again success always largely depends upon good nursing."

        "text": "# \nHOW TO (ARRY OUT THE PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL (LEANLINESS IN GYNECOLOGICAL NURSING. \n3. Surgical Cleanliness is of supreme inportance in gynecological wards, and it is necessary that every nurse should understand the reason why such is the case. If she do not, inany of the details here enjoined will seem needless and irksome, and she will have little spontaneous zeal for carrying them out ; but if she clearly grasp how wound-poisoning arises and what it means, she will not only be anxious to guard against it by the observance of all enjoined precautions but will be able to apply the sane principles in many circumstances where no forewarning has been possible. \nThe first point to be realised is that all dirt or foreign matter in or near a wound threatens sepsis or poisoning in the wound. The absence of such dirt is implied by the term surgical cleanliness ; but this means not only freedom from foreign matter which is perceptible to sight or smell, but also from any germ or poison whatever ; and the presence of some of these all too easily escapes detection by the senses."
    },
    {
        "page_idx": 16,
        "text": "The worst of all kinds of dirt is that which arises from putrefying organic matter, for this contains a living poison, a poison which can grow and multiply like weeds in a garden, or mould in a damp cellar, and its action can spread like that of yeast in dough. Whenever anything turns offensive or putrid such living poison germs svarm. \nIt must next be remembered that any raw surface, particularly a recent wound, is liable to absorb such material. So are the internal passages and cavities of the body. Dressings soaked with pus from an abscess, linen soiled by vaginal discharge, sponges soaked with blood, surgical instruments imperfectly cleaned, will all infallibly breed wound-poison if left alone ; and if the discharge be offensive, the poison is already present, ready to produce the most disastrous consequences."

        "text": "If, for example, a catheter were fouled by decomposing urine, and if in this condition it vere introduced into a perfectly healthy bladder, it is probable that in a day or tvo that bladder would be found full of ammoniacal urine mixed with mucus and pus. If a sponge that had escaped washing were Used to cleanse a recently sutured perineum, the whole wound might suppurate and the operation completely fail. If  just  after giving a vaginal douche to a septic case a. nuse took her place to hand sponges at an ovariotomy, the patient mighit die in consequence. \nEvery nursc vill have been struck with the extreme difficulty of freeing the hands from odour vhen they have been fouled by offensive discharge. No amount of washing with soap and disinfectants seems to accomplish it. This is a valuable lesson im the subtleness and tenacity of the enemy we have to combat. \nConsidering that recent wounds are particularly liable to infection, and that in gynaecological  wards  operation  cases  are necessarily brought into the neighbourhood of those which are septic, or which have materials ready for sepsis to arise on the least carelessness, it must be very plain why a gynaecological nurse has so much need to be careful to preserve surgical cleanliness and to prevent the poisoning of her patients."

This is partly included in the above, but it embraces more particularly the subject  of  disinfection or  destruction  of poison already existing, and the special precautions necessary when a nurse has been obliged to come in contact with a septic case."

        "text": "4.It will be useful here to give a definition of certain terms frequently llsed. \nSepsis, as we have said, means woundpoisoning. \nSeptic means “ in a condition of sepsis, 01° causing sepsis. \nAsepsis means the absence of sepsis, and aseptic is the corresponding adjective. The term Antiseptic is applied to any material or agent which is not only free from septic matter, but has also the power of preventing or hindering its production and growth. \nFor instance, recently boiled water is aseptic ; so is perfectiy clean linen ; so are new sponges properly prepared, new lint, wool, and simple dressings. \nBut solution of carbolic acid, sal-alembroth wool, boracic wool, etc., are cntiseptic. Pus and blood absorbed by these"
