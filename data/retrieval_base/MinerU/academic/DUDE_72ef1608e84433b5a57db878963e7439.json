The work, which occupied the greater part of a year $\\left(1907-8\\right)$ , had for its object an inquiry into the faunal succession of the Upper Bernician. \nThe scheme adopted for zoning was that used by Dr. Arthur Vaughan in his work on the Carboniferous Limestone formation of the South-West Province, and successfully applied by subsequent workers to other Carboniferous areas in Britain."

        "text": "I take this opportunity of thanking those gentlemen who have so generously aided me in my undertaking. I am especially indebted to Prof. G. A. Lebour and Dr. Vaughan, to Prof. Lebour for his advice and encouragement whilst carrying out the feld-work, and to Dr. Vaughan for determining the corals and for other valuable assistance. My thanks are also due to Dr. IVheelton Hind for naming the lamellibranchs, and to several members of H.M. Geological Survey, namely to Dr. Traquair for identifying the fish remains, to Dr. Kitchin and to Mr. R. G. Carruthers. Lastly I must express my great obligation to Mr. John Dunn, formerly of Redesdale, for allowing me access to his valuable collection of Redesdale fossils--the result of many years' careful collecting. \n# \n# \nThe Bernician series forms the upper, and by far the larger, division of the Lower Carboniferous sequence of Northumberland, and covers the greater part of the county. It is divisible into two groups, the upper or Calcareous Division and the lower or Carbonaceous Division. Below the Bernician strata lie the Tuedian beds, including under the term the Fell Sandstone series and the Cementstone group. The Northumberland succession, together with the Lower Carboniferous rocks north of the T'weed, occupies the northern extremity of the Carboniferous Limestone tract, which stretches from Lancashire and Yorkshire into Scotland. \nThe Carboniferous strata in Northumberland encircle the Cheviots on the south, east, and north, and dip from the volcanic inlier, so that the general strike forms a rough semicircle round the igneous massif, nearest to which consequently lie the lowest beds. (See map.) In the south and east, the strata may be followed as continuous outcrops. In the districts  round the  volcanic  inlier  faulting haseltirely destroyed the continuity of strike, but in the north it has spread out the scattered and repeated outcrops into belts, which run in the same direction as the general strike."

        "text": "The thickness of the Carboniferous Limestone series in Northumberland is diffcult to estimate on account of excessive faulting and also owing to the great variations in thickness displayed by different members. It is probable that one division increases locally at the expense of another. The following figures given by members of H.M. Survey and others afford some idea regarding the thicknesses and variations of the groups ; but they are only approximate. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nBernician. Calcareous Division & Tyne \\& Rede. 4000? & Coquet. & Tweed. 1700 \\\\\nCarbonaceous Division Tuedian. & 2500 & Thin. & 900 \\\\\nFell Sandstone Series & 600 & 2000 & 600 \\\\\nCementstone Group & 600 & 1000 & 2500 \\\\\n \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nBetween the Coquet and the Tweed the Cementstone group thins out locally to a few hundred feet (3oo or 4oo ?). \nThe Bernician series is mainly built up of shales and sandstones, but interbedded among the argillaceous and arenaceous deposits are beds of limestone and coal. Calcareous horizons are found in both divisions of the series, but the beds in the upper contrast strongly with those of the lower.  In the Calcareous Division the limestones are thick, truly marine, and constant, some of them traversing the whole length of the county. In the Carbonaceous they are thin and impure, and often contain rootlets of Stigmaria; a few marine limestones make their appearance in the south. It is with the upper limestones that this paper is solely concerned, and my investigations were restricted to the country north of the Tyne. \nSouth of Northumberland the Upper Bernician is mainly represented by the Yoredale rocks; the basal limestones, together with the Carbonaceous Division, are equivalent to the Great Scar Limestone series. The higher Yoredale strata disappear as they are followed southward ; till in Wharfedale the Millstone Grit comes almost immediately upon the Main $\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\rho}}=$ Great)Limestone."

        "text": "# \nPHYSICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILING DURING THE DEPOSITIONOF THE SERIES. \nThis series of thick detrital acumulations, containing numerous beds of coal and frequent interpolations of calcareous strata, could only have been formed in the proximity of land, and under very varying conditions, involving continuous oscillation of the sea foor and repeated change in geographical relationships. The rate of accumulation of sediment must at one period have exceeded the rate of subsidence, so that the sea became so silted up as to form a swamp in which grew the jungles that formed the coal seams. Rapid submergence followed, and these vegetable accumulations often became the foor upon which the calcareous deposits were laid down. The limestones were deposited near enough to the coast to allow frequent invasions of fine sediment, as indicated by the numerous shaly partings and interbedded shales. \n# \n# \nThe limestones of the Calcareous Division may be divided into three groups. The limestones above the Little Limestone, which occupy the south and east of Northumberland and which thin out towards the north, form the Upper Group; the Middle Group comprehends those thick and continuous beds which can be followed right across the county, and includes the Great Limestone; whilst to the Lower Group belong the limestones of the Calcareous Division below the Eelwell Limestone."

I have completed the list of the lamellibranchs from the list recently drawn up by Dr. Wheelton Hind. \nThe Woodend and Dun Limestone. THE IVOODEND LIMESTONE $=$ THE HOBBERLAW LIMESTONE $=$ THE REDESDALE LIMESTONE. \nGeographical Distribution. \nThe outcrops of the Woodend and Dun Limestones form with the Carbonaceous beds a belt girdling the Cheviots on the east and north, but separated from the volcanic mass by the Tuedian beds. Approaching the Tweed this belt bends round to the east and strikes out to sea south of Tweedmouth. \n# \nBoth compact beds ; the Woodend is about 10 or 12 feet in thickness, the Dun about 6 feet,"

        "text": "The Calcareous Beds lying between the Scar Limestone and the Fourlaws Limestone, Tyne and Rede District. \nTime has not allowed of a systematic examination of these limestones. In the country north of the Tyne are some ten or so of them, which, although little quarried, are exposed in the numerous burns. To the west of the North Tyne a number of quarries afford access to them. \nThese limestones mainly belong $\\mathrm{D}_{2}$ , but the lowest of them yield forms characteristic of $\\mathrm{D}_{\\perp}$ \nThe limestone which lies above the Fourlaws Limestone, and which is exposed in Shanks Kiln Quarry, contains in addition to forms common to D1 and $\\mathrm{D}_{2}$ \nCampophyllum derbiense,\\* Vaughan.   \nCyathophyllum murchisoni, Ed. and H. \nThrough the kindness of Miss Dinning of Simonburn, I have had the opportunity of examining a number of forms she has collected from the shale exposed by one of the burns in that neighbourhood. The shale represents a low horizon in II of the table on p. $59^{8}$ , but occurs some distance above the limestone previously mentioned. \nDibunophyllids. ? Productus longispinus, Sow.
