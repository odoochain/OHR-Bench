        "text": "# \nBarbara M. Sullivan and Howard F. McMurdie \nThere isno evidence for the existence of any crystalline hydrate ofchromium orthophosphate other than the hexahydrate.This breaks down near $130^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ toanamorphous material.If the unstrained and coarse hexahydrate is heated,it recrystallizes at $1,014^{\\circ}$ C to an unstable, fine-grained compound (BCrPO).If the original hydrate is ground and thus strained,itwill forma stable compound (αCrPO)at $972^{\\circ}$ C.X-raydiffractionpowder patterns are given for the three crystalline forms,and the general relation of chromium orthophosphatehexahydratetootherhydratesisdiscussed. \n# \nA study oftheforms ofchromium orthophosphate wassuggestedbytheNationalInstitutesofHealth. They needed a radioactive material that was insoluble and nontoxic.Chromium orthophosphate with radioactivephosphorushadbeenusedinsimilarwork [1].1 They found,however,that it was difficult to prepare a uniform anhydrous compound by heating the hexahydrate, inasmuch as the temperature of dehydration wasvery critical. \nThere are only a fewprevious studies of the compound reportedin the fiterature. Joseph and Rae [2]in 1917 reported a violet hexahydrate, as well as a crystalline tetra-and dihydrate.In 1948 Clark and Tai [3] made X-ray powder patterns of the hexa- and tetrahydrates and found them identical,whereas patterns of the dihydrate and anhydrous forms indicated amorphousmaterial. \n# \nThe samples studied herewere given to theBureau by the National Institutes of Health.They were prepared ashexahydrate $(\\mathrm{CrPO_{4}.6H_{2}O})$ ),using amodification of the method of Joseph and Rae[2] described in detail by Ness, Smith, and Evans [4]. Differential thermal-analysis studies were made by standard methods [5], using a program controller, a direct-current amplifier, and automatic recording. X-ray patterns were made on a North American Philips High-Angle Geiger Counter Spectrometer, using the techniques described by Swanson and Tatge [6] to obtain accurate spacings and intensities. In some cases patterns were made with the sample at high temperatures in the furnace described by Van Valkenburg and McMurdie[7]. $\\mathrm{CuK}\\alpha$ radiation was used in all cases $\\lambda{=}1.5405$ \n# \nThe hexahydrate, as shown in figure 1,is violet in color, prismatic and twinned in habit, biaxial negativewith $\\alpha{=}1.568,\\beta{=}1.591,\\gamma{=}1.599,2V{=}13^{\\circ}.$ The $d$ spacings and relative intensities of the powder pattern areshown in table1. \nFIGURE 1.Chromium orthophosphate hexahydrate; $\\times\\:15\\theta$ \nTABLE 1. d-Spacings and relative intensities of chromium orthophosphatehexahydrate \n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\nd & I & d & I & d & I & d & I \\\\\n5.76 5.63 5.35 5.27 4.87 & 6 28 11 24 40 & 3.46 3.33 3.29 3.05 2.95 & 30 7 6 8 9 & 2.57 2.48 2.47 2.43 2.38 & 12 9 8 4 4 & 1.924 1.903 1.874 1.808 1.701 & 12 4 6 8 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe chromium orthophosphate hexahydrate, when heated, begins to lose water at about $100^{\\circ}$ Cand loses approximately 95 percent of the total between $100^{\\circ}$ and $400^{\\circ}$ C.

        "text": "They showed that while most of the loss is near $130^{\\circ}$ C, the vapor-pressure curve indicates no sharp breaks, and there is considerable loss, even up to $800^{\\circ}$ C.With the initial loss of water, the material changes first to a bright-green color and then becomes dark brown.The X-ray powder pattern of material heatedupto $130^{\\circ}$ C becomes gradually weaker but is otherwise unchanged.Above $130^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~C~}$ thepattern indicates amorphous material. No evidence was found here for the existence of the crystalline tetrahydrate reported by others [2, 3]. It was reported as being produced by boiling the hexhydrate in HO for half an hour. Material treated in this manner was bright green and showed a weak X-ray pattern of the hexahydrate. Under the microscope it appeared as a mixture of the crystalline hexahydrate and amorphous material.Weight-loss determinations of the boiled material indicated the loss of approximately 1 molecule of water. \nFiGURE 2.Differential thermal analysis curves of $\\mathrm{CrPO_{4}.6H_{2}O}$ heatedat $\\scriptstyle{12}\\%^{\\circ},$ /minute.

Figure 3 shows a sample that has been held at $600^{\\circ}$ Cfor $66\\%$ hours.It may be noted that theexternal shape of the original hexahy drate is retained. This is typical of material heated in this temperature range. \n# \nThe exothermicbreaks on the differential thermalanalysis curves (fig. 2) near $1,000^{\\circ}$ C indicate_the crystallization of anhydrous chromium orthophosphate.Two_different crystal forms exist, one of which is stable.The stable high-temperature form is designated. $\\alpha$ , and the lower, unstable form,. $\\beta$ The $\\beta$ form is produced when unground material is heated and its formation produces the sharp break at $1{,}014^{\\circ}$ C.At higher temperatures this form gradually changes to $\\alpha$ chromium orthophosphate.Although the X-ray pattern does not show the $\\alpha$ form until it has been heated to $1,400^{\\circ}.$ C, microscopic examinationindicatesitsformationinsmallamounts as low as $1,200^{\\circ}.$ C. Fairly pure $\\beta$ chromium orthophosphate can be formed when the unground hexahydrateisheateda shorttimebetween $1,000^{\\circ}$ and $1,100^{\\circ}$ C, but prolonged heating near $1,100^{\\circ}\\/$ Cresults intheformationofanoticeable amountof the $\\alpha$ form.

It was atfirst thought that chromium orthophosphate was related to silica in an analogous manner, but no evidencewasfoundtosupportthis. \nThe formationofanunstableform oftheanhydrous compound, when unground material is used, isevidencethatthe $\\beta$ formismorecloselyalliedto theoriginal structurethan isthe $\\alpha$ form.When the starting material is ground with an attendant increase in surface, it approaches equilibrium more rapidlyandthe $\\beta$ form is not obtained.It is apparentthatthe $\\beta$ formisnotstableabove $973^{\\circ}$ C. The formation of a preliminary unstable phase is not an unusual occurrence; the formation of $\\gamma\\mathrm{{Al_{2}O_{3}}}$ in kaolinite is such a case [8]. When 3CaO.Al0 $^3$ 6H $^{-2}$ is dehydrated, the first crystal phases formed are $\\mathrm{12CaO.7Al_{2}O_{3}}$ and CaO, whereas the final equilibrium compound is the single phase 3CaO.Al20 $^{3}$ [11] . Grim and Bradley [9] have noted the occurrence of various unstable phases in dehydration of clays and other silicates."
