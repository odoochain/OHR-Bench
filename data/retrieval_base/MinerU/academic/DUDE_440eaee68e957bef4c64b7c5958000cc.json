Diabetes can be associated with serious complications and premature death, but persons with diabetes can take measures to reduce the likelihood of such occurrences. \n# \nTotal: 15.7 million people -- $5.9\\%$ of the population — have diabetes. \nDiagnosed: 10.3 million people Undiagnosed: 5.4 million people \n# \nNew cases diagnosed per year: 798,000 \n# \n$\\spadesuit$ Studies have found death rates to be twice as high among middle-aged people with diabetes as among middle-aged people without diabetes.   \n$\\spadesuit$ Based on death certificate data, diabetes contributed to 187,800 deaths in 1995.   \n$\\spadesuit$ Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death listed on U.S. death certificates in 1995, according to CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.   \n$\\spadesuit$ Diabetes is believed to be underreported on death certificates, both as a condition and as a causeofdeath. \n\\* For further information on prevalence, see the Appendix."

Type 1 diabetes may account for $5\\%$ to $10\\%$ ofall diagnosed cases of diabetes. Risk factors are less well defined for type 1 diabetes than for type 2 diabetes, but autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors are involved in the development of this type of diabetes. \nType 2 diabetes was previously called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult-onset diabetes. Type 2 diabetes may account for about $90\\%$ to $95\\%$ Of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, prior history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes. \nGestational diabetes develops in $2\\%$ to $5\\%$ of all pregnancies but disappears when a pregnancy is over. Gestational diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and persons with a family history of diabetes. Obesity is also associated with higher risk. Women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk for later developing type 2 diabetes. In some studies, nearly $40\\%$ of women with a history of gestational diabetes developed diabetes in the future. \n\"Other specific types” of diabetes result from specific genetic syndromes, surgery, drugs, malnutrition, infections, and other illnesses.

        "text": "# \nDiabetes knowledge, treatment, and prevention strategies advance daily. Treatment is aimed at keeping blood glucose near normal levels at all times. Training in self-management is integral to the treatment of diabetes. Treatment must be individualized and must address medical, psychosocial, and lifestyle issues. \nTreatment of type 1 diabetes: Lack of insulin production by the pancreas makes type 1 diabetes particularly difficult to control. Treatment requires a strict regimen that typically includes a carefully calculated diet, planned physical activity, home blood glucose testing several times a day, and multiple daily insulin injections.   \nTreatment of type 2 diabetes: Treatment typically includes diet control, exercise, home blood glucose testing, and in some cases, oral medication and/or insulin. Approximately $40\\%$ of people with type 2 diabetes require insulin injections. \n# \nImpaired fasting glucose is a new diagnostic category in which persons have fasting plasma glucose values of $110{-}125\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ . These glucose values are greater than the level considered normal but less than the level that is diagnostic of diabetes. It is estimated that 13.4 million persons, $7.0\\%$ of the population, have impaired fasting glucose. Scientists are trying to learn how to predict which of these persons will go on to develop diabetes and how to prevent such progression."

        "text": "# \n# \nPeriodically, the federal government conducts surveys to determine the health of Americans. Such surveys involve questionnaires and medical tests. The diabetes prevalence and incidence estimates presented in this fact sheet were developed by analyzing the newest available national survey data and then adjusting for changes in the population based on 1997 census estimates. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes represents the number who said they had diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes represents the number of people who said they did not have diabetes, but when given a fasting plasma glucose test, they did in fact have abnormally elevated blood glucose levels (defined as fasting plasma glucose levels greater than or equal to $126~\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ .Otherestimates presented in this fact sheet were based on individual surveys, research projects, and registry data. A listing of references and additional data sources are at the end of this fact sheet. \n# \nBetween the 1995 and 1997 fact sheets, the number of persons with diagnosed diabetes 1ncreased from 8 million to 10.3 million, but the number of persons with undiagnosed diabetes decreased. For the 1995 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, the number of persons with undiagnosed diabetes was estimated from research using the ora! glucose tolerance test to identify undiagnosed diabetes. In contrast, for the 1997 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, the number of persons with undiagnosed diabetes was estimated from research using the fasting plasma glucose test, according to recently enacted recommendations. These tests are not equivalent, however, and fewer cases of undiagnosed diabetes are identified using the fasting plasma glucose test under current recommendations. \nAn enhanced national effort to identify previously undiagnosed persons may also have contributed to a decrease in the number of persons with undiagnosed diabetes. Continued efforts to identify persons with undiagnosed diabetes, the implementation of new guidelines for screening, and the use of an easier and less expensive diagnostic test are all likely to lead to even further decreases in the number of persons with undiagnosed diabetes and increases in the number of persons with diagnosed diabetes. \n# \nAmerican Diabetes Association.
