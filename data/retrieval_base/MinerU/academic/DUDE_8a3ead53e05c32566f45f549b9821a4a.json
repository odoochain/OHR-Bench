        "text": "A.V. Shipilin (Moscow) \nThe problem is discussed of finding the form of twodimensional and axisymmetric bodies guaranteeing the minimum wave drag in the supersonic flow of an ideal gas. The solution is sought among those bodies which -- when flow passes around them -- give rise to associated shock waves. Limitations on the contour of the body are arbitrary: One may pre-assign the dimensions of the body, its volume, area, etc. Similar problems with arbitrary isoperimentric conditions can be solved by a method proposed in (Refs. 1, 2). This method consists of using the exact equations of gas dynamics, describing the flow, as supplementary constraints. In the articles (Refs. 3-6) this method was further developed during the solution of a number of problems. \n1. Let x and y be the coordinate axes (Figure l), ab -- the contour of the desired body, ac -- the associated shock wave, bc -- the characteristic of the second family, cd -- the characteristic of the first family. It is assumed that inside the region abc the flow is supersonic, and there are no shock waves. The incoming stream is uniform. Let u and v be the projections of the velo-- city on the axes $\\mathbf{x}$ and y,let $\\mathcal{P}$ denote the pressure, $\\uprho$ -- the density of the gas,  -- the stream function, where \n$$\nd\\Psi=y^{v}\\left(u d y-v d x\\right)\n$$\n$v=0$ and l correspondingly, respectively, to the two-dimensional and the axisymmetric case.  Here all the quantities are considered to be dimensionless, and $\\uppsi$ at the body will be taken as equal to zero. \nThe problem is analyzed in terms of the variables $\\psi,~\\mathbf{y}$ ._ The stationary, non-isotropic flow of the gas inside the region abc is described by the equations \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{L_{1}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial y^{\\flat}p}{\\partial\\Psi}\\mathrm{-}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}=0,\\qquadL_{2}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\Psi}\\frac{u}{v}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\frac{1}{y^{\\flat}\\wp v}=0}\\ &{\\frac{w^{2}}{2}+\\frac{\\kappa p}{(\\kappa-1)\\mathfrak{p}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{z+1}{\\kappa-1},\\qquad\\frac{p}{\\wp^{\\ast}}=\\mathfrak{q}^{\\times-1}(\\Psi)}\\ &{\\qquad\\quad\\tilde{w}=\\sqrt[\\gamma]{\\bar{u}^{2}+\\bar{v}^{2}}.}\\end{array}\n$$\nHere $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ is the adiabatic exponent; $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ is the entropy function.

Given a certain contour $\\alpha\\boldsymbol{b}$ , one can compute -- for a given incoming flow -- the flow in the region $\\boldsymbol{s}$ which is a region of influence for ab. On the basis of the flow found, one can solve the Cauchy boundary problem for the multipliers $\\hslash_{1}$ and $\\hslash_{2}$ satisfying the system of equations (2.4) and the boundary conditions (2.7). The contour $a b$ should be chosen in such a way that the flow parameters and the functions $\\hbar_{1},\\hbar_{2}$ satisfy the conditions (2.9) and (2.10). In fact, the part ad (Figure 1) of the contour determines the flow in the region adc and the shock wave $\\alpha c\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\Omega~}\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\Omega~}\\alpha\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\Omega~}$ , the angle as a function of $\\uppsi$ . The part $d\\mathfrak{b}$ for data pertaining to the characteristic dc determines the flow in the region bcd and the characteristic $b c$ . Thus, two functions are not pre-assigned, and by controlling them one can satisfy the conditions (2.9) and (2.10). Moreover, we have $_n$ arbitrary constants $\\boldsymbol{\\Upsilon}_{\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}}}$ ,which are chosen in such a way that they should satisfy $\\mathscr{n}$ isoperimetric conditions (1.3). The constant of integration $\\Upsilon^{\\star}$ is found from the condition that the equalities (2.7) and (2.9) should be simultaneously satisfied at the point $b$ If the value of $\\mathbf{y}_{b}$ is not pre-assigned,then to find it we have the condition (2.8). \n3. We shall now study the relations (2.9) and (2.l0) at the point $_{\\alpha}$ .The integral terms, entering in (2.10), vanish at this point. The conditions (2.9) and (2.10) with respect to $\\hslash_{1}$ and $\\hslash_{2}$ represent a homogeneous system of two linear algebraic equations. If $\\hslash_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are not equal to zero, then the determinant  of this system should vanish. Since all the flow parameters at the point in question are determined in terms of $\\upsigma$ , we obtain the same condition for o in the case of ↓ = e \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\varepsilon\\equiv\\varkappa_{0}w\\sin^{2}\\theta-\\frac{4}{\\Theta}\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\sigma}\\rho_{0}w_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta[\\varkappa\\sin\\theta-\\cos\\theta\\sin(\\theta-\\mathsf{a})]=0}\\end{array}\n$$\nThis means that the solution of the problem formulated in this way exists only for certain special relations between the parameters of the incoming flow and the conditions (l.3) imposed on the body. In the general case, if $\\hslash_{1}$ and h2 are continuous at c, one cannot satisfy the conditions (2.9) and (2.10) simultaneously.

The problems of gas dynamics in connection with the utilization of discontinuous Lagrange multipliers were also investigated in (Ref. 5). \nFigure 2 \nWe shall divide the region $\\boldsymbol{s}$ into three subregions, as it is shown in Figure 2.

Thus, a discontinuity of the Lagrange multipliers, when there is a reflection from the shock wave, is damped for a certain region of angles o.

Chernyy,_when studying the flow around bodies similar to a wedge, showed that, for bodies with a preassigned elongation, the wedge is not the optimum form (Ref. 9). Only in the special case, when the preassigned aspect ratio is such that the condition (3.l) is satisfied, does the wedge guarantee minimum wave drag. For the axisymmetric case, in the case of an associated shock wave the corresponding class of smooth bodies was found in the work (Ref. 10). An analogous result for a non-uniform, incoming flow was obtained in (Ref. 1l). In the article (Ref. 12) with the same formulation of the problem as in (Ref. 9), but for larger Mach numbers, it was shown that the wave drag for a fixed lifting power and bodies similar to a wedge decreases with the introduction of an infinite number of breaks of positive and negative signs. \nFor purposes of simplicity, we shall consider first the flow structure/15 (figure 4) which is determined by one break of the contour at the point $\\vec{d}$ .In · this case, the isoperimetric condition over the length, with (l.4) being taken into consideration, is expressed in the following way:"

Therefore, the variation of the double integral -- when the point $\\bar{d}$ is varied -- may not be equal to zero. \nThe calculations were performed in accordance with the work by A. N.
