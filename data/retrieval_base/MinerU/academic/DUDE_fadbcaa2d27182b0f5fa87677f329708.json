        "text": "# \nTriple Divide is Public Herald’s first investigations into inevitable, negative impacts from shale gas industrial development and how those impacts are handled by the state, specifically the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). \nNarrated with help from actor and solutions advocate Mark Ruffalo, major findings include stark negligence and endangerment of public and environmental health due to shale gas extraction. Through personal stories, expert interviews, and investigation of state case files, Triple Divide tells a cautionary tale about a public agency meant to protect the public and environment that is instead protecting industry. \nThough extraction of shale gas will one day end, taking many 'boom and bust' jobs with it, contaminated groundwater aquifers, polluted land, and stories of victimization will remain. Pennsylvanians, fed up with corruption and destruction, won't 'go down' without a fight and are learning how to protect themselves. \n# \nTriple Divide is the truth behind shale gas extraction in Pennsylvania, part of an ongoing report by investigative news nonprofit, Public Herald. \nNarrated with help from actor and solutions advocate Mark Ruffalo, Triple Divide reveals how inevitable, negative impacts from shale gas extraction are being handled by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the public agency charged with permitting industrial development in pristine watersheds and peaceful backyards while protecting people and the environment. \nThrough personal stories, expert interviews, and DEP case files, Public Herald's 18-month investigation discovered recurring impacts: contaminated water, air, and land; intimidation and harassment; loss of property, investments, and standard of living; weak and under enforced state regulations; community disruption; destruction of the public trust; illness; fragmentation of Pennsylvania's last stands of core forest; and lack of protection over basic human rights. \nThough shale gas development will one day end, taking jobs with it, contaminated groundwater aquifers, environmental damage, and victim stories will remain.

        "text": "Expect Protection. Indeed, the agency's modus of operandi is clearly 'permit first' and 'figure the rest out later.' \nThe documentary is named after one of only four triple continental divides in North America. Known as the Triple Divide, from it everything is downstream. At this peak in northern Pennsylvania, rain from one storm travels to three separate sides of the continent - the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada, the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern seaboard, and the Gulf of Mexico. This vast water basin is drained by three major rivers - the Allegheny, the Genesee, and the Susquehanna. \nTriple Divide headwaters don’t just feed the largest area of Exceptional Value (specially regulated) water bodies in the state; they also feed part of the state’s largest stand of primitive forest - one of the last great wildernesses. These forested waterways rank among the most coveted trout streams in the United States, helping to create a sustainable tourism economy upon which locals have depended for generations. \nForested watersheds also provide $80\\%$ of Pennsylvania's drinking water. \nToday, these Wilds of Pennsylvania are being divided in many ways by shale gas industrialization, made possible by a new form of an old technology, commonly known as ‘fracking.’ Despite the powerlessness felt by some living in the shale fields, others see the current devastation as an opportunity to reacquainted residents with what's most important, stand up the world's largest industry, and map a better future for Pennsylvania and everyone downstream."

        "text": "# \n# \nI started Triple Divide to bridge the information on energy development in Pennsylvania, using water as a central theme and cultural resource for the state. The film and its shape transformed and became more closely connected to a dialogue of trust. Citizens of the Commonwealth had trusted their state agencies to protect them from the harms of industry, but the ever-building momentum and urgency of natural gas development strengthened at the expense of basic human rights. \nTriple  Divide  reveals  a  failure  in  state  regulations  and corporate  responsibility  to  our  most  primeval  resource,  water. \n\nThe  combination  of  these  things  leads  to  the  worst  Tragedy  of  the  Commons  we've  ever  faced  as  a civilization,  threatening  large-­scale  contamination  of  drinking  water  supplies.  So I left my native soils of Ohio in search of the truth, came to Pennsylvania with a camera in hand, and began telling the stories of Triple Divide, my first big step as a filmmaker. \nThank you to the courageous people who willingly unsheathed their stories for the world to see. Without them we are blindfolded. \n# \n\nFor me, most of Triple Divide wrote itself -- swept me along with it like a river.  The story is the same whether you’re covering fracking, health care, or modern warfare - profit over people. Money walks. \nI’m from Potter County, Pa., home of the triple continental divide.  Once I noticed problems with fracking there as a reporter, and realized $100,000+$ more wells are slated for the state with no plan, no health or environmental impact surveys - no other story mattered. \nDespite it being the biggest threat to the state’s long-term sustainability, media across the state either promoted or fell silent (usually when the industry ads started rolling in). So, the industry came after the loudest reporter in the state at the time (2011) - me.  Shortly after, I met Joshua Pribanic and we formed Public Herald, dedicated to journalism in the public interest. \nTriple Divide is our first major investigation.  It is my sincere hope that this film will make us all take a hard, honest look at the true, long-term costs of fracking and the desperate need for investigative journalism."

They introduce Josh to local reporter Melissa Troutman, who explains her story and takes Josh to a well pad on Denton Hill. Josh determines to return in a month to film and document the stories of Potter County in a film called God’s Country, nickname of Potter County. \nApril 19, 2011 - Chesapeake Energy suffers a blowout at the Atgas 2H well in Bradford County. Over 10,000 gallons of toxic waste fluid (flowback) is discharged into a tributary to Towanda Creek. The well takes 6 days to get under control. Troutman and Pribanic take an immediate interest in the case and begins following the story. \nMay 22, 2011 - Film production begins at a community event on public lands, a hike to shale gas extraction in the Susquehannock State Forest, then to the first Marcellus well drilled in Triple Divide headwaters, 500 feet from the East Fork Sinnemahoning Creek, a High Quality stream [featured in the film]. \nMay to July 2011 - Production continues, documenting landowners, businesses, landforms, community members, scientists. Requests for interviews with industry and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection are repeatedly declined. \nAugust 2011 - Understanding the role water is playing in the story, Josh and Melissa decide to rename the film, Triple Divide. \nAugust 2011 - Melissa and Josh are falsely detained and harassed by gas company workers hauling water in Tioga State Forest while filming night shots for Triple Divide. Public Herald files a report the following morning with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation & Natural Resources, and asks for documents to be distributed to local drillers explaining the rights of the public in state forests. Soon after, the regional investigator calls to explain how the gas company workers thought Public Herald journalists were \"Ecoterrorists.\" The investigator also stated he told the workers that they had violated our rights and were taking part in an illegal detainment. \nSeptember to October 2011 -Josh and Melissa continue to conduct file reviews at the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP’s) northcentral regional office in Williamsport, Pa., focusing on water contamination and gas migration cases, waste"

A series is established on files from the Chesapeake Bradford Blowout case in April, focusing on how DEP handles natural gas pollution. \nNovember 2011 - Chesapeake Energy agrees to be interviewed about the Bradford County Blowout after Public Herald publishes its second story on the event. [Public Herald made several attempts to talk with Chesapeake the prior three months.] \nDecember 19, 2011 - Public Herald publishes about the conflict of interest in the environmental assessment produced for Chesapeake Energy on the Bradford Blowout, with oversight from DEP, which discarded a predrill water test and citing the landowner’s opinion as “historical evidence.” The landowner said he thought his water tasted \"salty,\" which allowed a clean predrill test taken before the blowout to be considered inaccurate and uncharacteristic for his well. The decision to use the landowner’s claims as a means to discredit the predrill test calls into question predrill testing data collected across the state, endangering the validity of water tests paid for by homeowners and industry. \nJanuary 2012 - Pribanic & Pribanic files a lawsuit on behalf of Public Herald against Seneca Resources for the false detainment of Melissa and Josh on public state forest land. Public Herald is told by a Sandusky Ohio reporter that Pennsylvania administrative staff dropped the case against Seneca Resources and swept it under the rug. \nFebruary 2012 - The ‘Impact Fee’ bill, a.k.a Act 13, is signed into Pennsylvania law by Governor Tom Corbett, stripping community control of shale gas development by mandating it be permitted in all zoning districts, including residential areas, in exchange for the fees to repair and mitigate damage and loss. \nMarch 2012 - State agencies and natural gas companies continue to decline interviews and ignore emails and phone calls. \nApril to September 2012 - Filming and post-production continues with updates to investigations and the drilling in Pennsylvania slows down as gas prices on the market decrease.

Municipalities maintain their control of where fracking happens (but not how) through land use zoning. \nAugust to November 2012 - Public Herald contributes Triple Divide stories and resources and joins the editing team of Shalefield Stories, a grassroots publication of first-hand impacts in the shale fields of Pennsylvania and beyond. \nNovember - PA DEP is accused of misrepresenting drinking water pollution in the state. The ‘stink’ arose from a deposition in which DEP staff indicate that not all water test results are revealed to homeowners during water contamination investigations related to oil and gas operations, or fracking. \nNovember to December 2012 - Public Herald conducts test-screenings of Triple Divide for a broad range of audiences and incorporates feedback into final round of edits. \nMarch 2013 - Triple Divide World Premiere in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, the seat of county government in Potter County, home of the triple continental divide. \nApril 2013 - While continuing to coordinate screenings of Triple Divide, Public Herald begins its next round of water impact and citizen complaint investigations at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. \nSeptember 2013 - Public Herald embarks on a national screening tour of Triple Divide in communities impacted by or slated for fracking through 2014. \nMarch 2014 - Triple Divide is selected for Albuquerque Film & Media Experience 2014. \nMarch 2014 - Public Herald hooks up with producers at The Daily Show and helps create the comedy news show’s segment on fracking in Pennsylvania. \nApril 2014 - Public Herald wins \\$35K INNovation Fund grant from Investigative News Network and Knight Foundation to conduct it’s national tour."
