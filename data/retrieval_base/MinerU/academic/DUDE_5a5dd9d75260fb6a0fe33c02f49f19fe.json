        "text": "# \nAlthough its importance has been kept exceedingly quiet. The ('onvention on Biological Diversity is the inost sweeping treaty ever to be proposed in American history. calling for an unprccedented intrusion of govcrmincnt into the economic and social fabric of America and other nations. No other treaty in American history has proposed to so interfere with human interactions or the internal affairs of nations. The treaty provides its signers with potential to employ the treaty's provisions and language in social and culural engineering. intervention in cultural and social development, and the promotion or retardation of current social lifestyles. The Convention calls on countries to inventory and data basc not only biological infornation (National Biological Survey). but also inforination having more to do with social, cultural and cconomic structure than with biodiversity. \nThis treaty promises to be the source of more litigation than all other treaties combined. The goals of the Convention are: \n1) to preserve maxinum biological diversity in the unsupported belief that in doing so provides substantial benefits. Because no two deer,trout or blades of grass are cxactly identical. everything on carth will require government protection:   \n2) to control the nature and extent of natural and human resourees vwithin ccosystems. Sinee the Convention treats human activity as the principle threat to biodiversity. hunan aetivity must be tightly controlled and directed. Furthermore, the Convention demands these actions occur even without \"scientific certainty,\"   \n3) to ensure that others (\"developing countries\" rceiving preferential reatinent) obtain a fair and cquitable share of the products of research and development carricd out by other individuals and businesses. Signcrs of the Convention are encouraged to alter patent laws to allow for this \"sharing\" or redistribution of technology:   \n4) to transfer the production of goods and technologies that can in any inanner be related to biodiversity. including machinery, computer technology and possible even inilitary techuology. The treaty imakes no mention of personal propertyrights. \nThe vague twenty-odd page treaty will be enforced by inplememtation protocol based on a thre thousand page United Nations docunent entitled the Global Biodiversity Assessiment (GB.A). Yet. when the Senate rcquested copies, the United Nations refused to acknowledge the document even existed. Copies of the GBA do exist, however. and it permits govermnental control of any activity or thing which could conceivably have an inpact on biodiversity. Because terms such as \"biodiversity\" and \"sustainable use\" are cxeeedingly broad and vaguc. this demand permits federal control of everything and every activity. \nThe Bush administration rejected the treaty beeause of its finaneial implications on America. They also rejeeted the treaty because it was clear the treaty would retard the development of new technology to meet future needs \"by providing inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. and innplving that biotechmology developinent is unsafe.\" To obtain ratification of the Convcntion under the Clinton adininistration. Senator Pell and the State Department have offered the Anerican publie reservations 1o proteet the interests of this nation. Irtiele 37 of the Convention, however, specifically states that \"(InJo reserv ations inay be made to this treaty.\" \nIf this treaty is ratified. the trcaty will \n1. Weaken the sovereignty of the United States. U'nless Congress specifieally states otherv ise. The couts will assume that Congress has ratified the treaty with good faith intent to live up to the letter and spirit of the document. Numerous judicial decisions have made it abundantly clear that the courts will. wherever possible, seek to harmonize later Acts of Congress vith prior passed treaties unless Congress has clearl. indicated othervise. The history of cout deisions also makes it clear that the treaty. will replace inconsistent existing federal laws."

        "text": "2. Give Federal agencies powers that they would not have in the absence of the (Convention. Envirommental groups as well as the Environmental Protcction Ageney and other agencies inake it clear that they intend to treat the Convcntion as a sclf-executing treaty (Imcaning that Congress needs to take no fiurther action to implemcnt all thr provisions of the treaty other than ratification). Agcncics and the Administration are jusifying this selfexecuting without C'ongresional approval by interpretating fron the treaty language such as \"takc legislative, administrative. and policy imcasures.\" If Congress icavcs such language without specific stated checks and limitations, federal agencies will be able to cxpand their regulatory powers over land use and environmental regulations without limit. \n3. Provide for the adoption of protocols. annexes and amendments without C'ongressional authorization because of the treaty's intentional vagucness. The treaty only allows the United States with one vote in decision making, and no veto power or other protection against unrcasonable or overbearing action made by the Conference of the Partics. The only mechanisn by which the UInited States can object to an action under the trcaty is to withdravw from the entire treaty. Otherwise we are legally bound to the trcaty's provisions and protocols. This is something we should not de lightly once ratification has occured. Withdrawal cannot occur for a period of two years afier the trcaty is ratified. After this two year period has passed. withdrawal takes a ininimum of one ycar. \n4. Relegate peoplc and their interests to a secondary place compared with animals and plants. Becausc the Convention places the interests of people to a seeondary level to nature. the Convention imay allow govermnent to ignore or overrule the proleetion git cn to indiv iduals under the Constitulion. \n5. Usurp state and local land use and environmental regulatory power. Federal treaty powers in combination with the cour's broad interpretation of the Cornmerce Clause give the federal government broad regulatory powers nonnallyreserved for state and local govermnent. This is especiall true in liglt of statutes such as the ESA and Clean Water Aet. Furtheimore. if the Convention is inpleinented as a selfexecuting treaty, then the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution vwill render all inconsistent laws ineluding each and every state and local land use and cnvironmental regulation - null and void. Environmental groups have made it clear that they wilitigate under the \\dministrative Procedure Aet, NEPA and the eitizen suit provisions ofthe ESA and Clean Water. mineral. wildife and zoning questions inevitably federal questions based on a clainn of preeinption. These groupsvill $\\operatorname{lit}\\colon$ autliorily to do flhis beeause the couris are mandated to enforce treaties in litigation of private rights swhich are brought about by citizen suit provisions. \nIf ratified, the treaty will require broad expansion of current regulations. $\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\mathbf{u}$ this time there are no laws requiring protection of entire ecosysteins or restoration of human-impacted ccosystems. There are no laws requiring control or eradication of alien species or engaging in determining what cultures. cultural practices. lifestvles and traditions should be encouraged and which should be abolished. There are no laws that contemplate the systematie and wholesale transference of technology and existing propert or the fruits of research and development fron the hands of those who own that technology. property and researeh to those vho do not. Ratification of this treaty willrequire the rewriting of America's legal systeim. \nThe Biodiversity convention is the comerstone of future cnvironmental litigation and legislation. Without ratification of this treaty. environmentalists will be unable to obtain many' of the changes to the Endangered Specics Act and Clean Water Act which they desire. but cannot justify in an open debate. W'ithout ratification of the treaty. many of the actions taken by federal agencies in recent year's may be proven unconstitutional. \nThis summayisbased on the \\*Technical Consderations of the Ccnvent on on Bolog cai Diveraty-The Unconventonal Convention\" by Mark Pollt and published by the National Wilderness Irstuiute Mr Poliot was tormerly a speaa assistant in the Land and Naturai Resources Diuson in the U.S Department of Justce and curently Presiden: Ccnst:tuioral Law Foundation in Boise Idaho and practices enwronmental, land use and consttutionalaw.
