Wyckoff Introduction \nThis report is a final report issued at the termination of an Air Force Office of Scientific Research Project entitled \"Attenuation Coefficients of High Energy X-rays\". The project is continuing under the direct support of the National Bureau of Standards as project number 0466. \nThe objective of the program initiated with Air Force support was the direct measurement of the total attenuation coefficients for X-rays in the energy range from 5 to 180 Mev. The research to date has resulted in detailed attenuation coefficients in hydrogen, carbon, water and aluminum, which demonstrate specific areas requiring further theoretical and experimental investigations. For example, the NBS experiments have shown that the attenuation coefficients listed in the standard reference, NBS Circular 583 entitled $\\mathfrak{m}_{\\pmb{\\mathbb{X}}}$ -ray Attenuation Coefficients from l0 kev to 100 Mev\",1/a/ are incorrect by about $4\\%$ at 60 Mev for low atomic number materials. The source of the discrepancy is not understood, although the pair production cross section is suspect. A complete understanding will result from further experimental and theoretical estimates of phenomena such as the radiative corrections to the Compton and pair cross sections, and the limited accuracy of pair production predictions. \nDuring the course of the present experiment $\\alpha^{2/3/}$ it was necessary to investigate such related areas as high-energy X-ray spectra/5/6/7/ , development and operation of large scintillation spectrometers8/2/10/ll/12/ , The references identified by superscripts in the introduction and background sections are listed at the end of the background section."

The following is an enumeration and an amplification of those conditions. \nThe important requirements were: \nA high energy X-ray source that was continuously distributed in energy. with X-rays in the energy range from 10 to 90 Mev This energy range permitted an accurate evaluation of the total attenuation coefficient from 30 to 80 Mev where the electronic processes predominate. The range also permitted a determination of the coefficients from l5 to 30 Mev where the nuclear absorptions are also important for low atomic number materials. The shape of the distribution of $\\pmb{\\uptau}$ -ray intensity (photon number times photon energy) was derived by Hisdall6/ for the case of a small-solid-angle detector located on the axis of the X-ray beam. The geometrical conditions assumed by Hisdal were very well satisfied in the present experiment.

Thus, since a $2\\%$ intensity change was easily measureable, a measurement of an attenuation coefficient to $0.2\\%$ was in principle possible. It is also obvious from Table 1 that the total nuclear cross sections are sufficiently large compared to the electronic cross sections that a large dip will be produced in a high-energy X-ray spectrum by an attenuator whose length is l0 mean free paths. \nTABLE 1 \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\nMaterial & Energy & Total Nuclear & Total Nuclear Plus Electronic & IP Expected I for â Px = 10 \\\\\nCarbon Water & 22.4 Mev 22.5 Mev & 2 0.0012cm /g 0.00075cm2/g 0.0012cm2/g & 0.0164cm2/g 0.01855cm2/g & 73% 40% 53% \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n7 The attenuators are of such a length that the data may be interpreted easily. It is shown below that for relatively broad nuclear levels and short attenuators the attenuation dip in the X-ray spectrum will be a direct function of length and integrated nuclear cross section. For either a very sharp resonance or very long attenuators, the attenuation will be a function of the square root of length and integrated cross section. The results of the experiment reported in attachment C have been analyzed by assuming that the nuclear cross section shape could be resolved by the spectrometer and that the nuclear attenuation was exponential (linear for short lengths). These analyses have resulted in experimental nuclear cross sections that are fairly close to, and somewhat larger than, cross sections synthesized from data obtained by very different methods. If resonances as sharply defined as the l5.l Mev carbon resonance (an extreme example) made up the giant resonance region, the experimental nuclear cross sections would have been much smaller (and not larger) than the synthesized cross sections. These results suggest that the nuclear cross sections for carbon, water, and aluminum have very little fine structure in the giant resonance region."

KoCH Radiation Physics Laboratory, National Bureau of Standards,\\* Washington, D. C. (ReceivedOctober7,1953) \nX-ray spectrometers are described that operate on the principle of totally absorbing the energy of an individual x-ray photon in a scintillator. Experiments with scintillators of xylene containing terphenyl, and of sodium iodide activated by thallium, show that detection eficiencies better than 80 percent and energy resolutions better than 10 percent are attainable in the x-ray energy range from $^{\\ddag}$ to50Mev.MonteCarlo calculations and crude scaling laws that simplify extrapolations to other size scintillators are discussed. \n# \nHE determination of the energy of an individual x-ray photon is usually accomplished by the analysis of a single interaction of the photon with matter. The interaction processes that have permitted accuracies of better than 5 percent in the energy ntasurement are coherent scattering, photoelectric alsorption, Compton scattering, and pair production. Aithough good energy resolution? is obtainable by these techniques, their main disadvantage is low detection efficiencies, which are characteristically of the orderof $10^{-8}$ percent, \nThe combination of a detection efficiency close to 100 percent and a good energy resolution is attainable by the application of scintillation spectrometers in which $\\mathbf{x}$ -ray photons interact multiple times and are totally. absorbed. The total absorption of an $\\pmb{x}$ -rayphoton in a large volume of scintillation material will produce a light pulse amplitude that is proportional to the $\\pmb{x}$ -ray energy. Preliminary results? have been reported on a spectrometer that employed a tank of xylene liquid and terphenyl plus photomultiplier light detectors. The following report will describe the details of the xylene spectrometer and two sodium iodide spectrometers that are intended for research with pulsed accelerators in the $\\pmb{x}\\cdot$ ray energy range from $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}$ to $50~\\mathrm{Mev}$ \nSeveral physicists at other laboratories have made independent suggestions, experiments, and calculations on the general principle of â\"total absorption\" spectrometers. \nR. Sternheimer has made shower calculations in order to estimate the energy resolution obtainable with a $4~\\mathrm{in}$ .diameter and $10~\\mathrm{in}$ . long sodium iodide crystal spectrometer that was proposed for the measurement of the energy of 2-Bev $\\pmb{x}\\cdot$ ray photons. He also investigated a combination of lead glass and organic liquid scintillator for the same measurement. \nThe recent work of Kantz and Hofstadter? has permitted useful predictions on the performance of sodium-iodide, total-absorption spectrometers for 100 to 160Mev electrons and $\\pmb{x}\\cdot$ -rays. In their experiments they measured the distribution of energy loss in copper produced by 110 and 157 Mev electron beams. \nThe results in references 3, 5, and 6 show that total absorption  spectrometers can provide good  energy resolution with high detection efficienciesfor $\\pmb{x}$ -rays. A third desirable and concomitant characteristic of this type of spectrometer is the possibility of supplying the $\\pmb{x}\\cdot$ -ray energy information from a single voltage pulse instead of the requirement of a coincident counting of two particles as in a pair spectrometer. \nThe importance of high detection efficiencies and the disadvantage of two-particle coincident counting in work with pulsed accelerators were demonstrated by J. L. Lawson.7 He analyzed the length of experimental time required to measure a spectrum of betatron x-rays with a pair spectrometer. Low $\\pmb{x}$ -rayintensities were required with the betatron in order to minimize the possible confusion of the positron from one pair with the electron from another. As a result, the experimental time for many low-energy, pulsed-accelerator experiments using a pair spectrometer is of the order of weeks? or longer, and is intolerably long. \nIn contrast, the: time. for similar experiments with a total absorption spectrometer is of the order of hours.8 Therefore, many experiments with pulsed accelerators should become feasible by the proper application of these spectromet.ers."

Light detectors: eight 2-in. diameter photomultipliers. \n# \nA liquid scintillation spectrometer was the first model constructed because of its ease of fabrication and relatively small cost. The scintillator consisted of a $7\\frac{1}{8}$ in. diameter by ${\\bf48}{\\bf\\Delta i n}$ . long tank of xylene liquid in which was dissolved terphenyl crystal to a concentration of 2 grams per liter. Single x-ray photons, whose energies were to be measured by the spectrometer, were directed down the central axis of the effective scintillator volume. The light resulting from the absorption of radiation energy in the liquid was detected by sixteen RCA 5819 photomultipliers. A schematic picture of the spectrometer is shown in Fig. 1. \nThe photomultiplier output pulses can supply the data from which the energy can be obtained with good energy resolution, for the individual $\\pmb{x}$ -raysproducing those pulses, if three conditions are satisfied. \n\nFirst, most of the cascading interactions by which the original x-ray photon dissipates its energy must be confined to the spectrometer scintillator. \nSecond, the light resulting from energy loss in the scintillator must be collected uniformly. \nThird, the number of light photons detected by the photomultiplier tubes for each .absorbed $\\pmb{x}$ -raymust be large enough to minimize the effect of statistical fuctuations. This is particularly a problem for the xylenie (terphenyl) scintillator because of its large size and poor geometry, and because the number of photons liberated for a given electron energy loss is small.9 \nMost of the time during the development of the spectrometer of Fig. 1 was spent in insuring uniform and efficient light collection to satisfy conditions 2 and 3. However, because of the recent availability of selfabsorption data\\*o for light in scintillators and of largearea photomultipliers, the present xylene-spectrometer design can be considerably improved and will not be described in detail. Therefore, only the results of calculations will be given, since they should prove to be a useful guide to satisfying condition 1 in any future design of a spectrometer employing an organic scintillator."

        "text": "# \nThe Monte Carlo sampling techniquell was used to provide quantitative evaluation of the performance of a specifc scintillator in a total absorption spectrometer. The calculations for xylene were done for the five $\\pmb{\\mathrm{x}}$ -ray photon energies of 1, 5, 15, 25 and $35~\\mathrm{{Mev}}$ , and for a tank that was ${6.5~\\mathrm{in}}$ . in diameter and $48~\\mathrm{in}$ . long. A larger diameter of $7_{8}^{1}$ in. was used in practice. For each Monte Carlo history an individual x-ray photon was followed in to the xylene until the $\\mathbf{x}.$ ray energy was degraded to a value that was 0.2 percent of the initial energy. The energy that was retained in the xylene was divided by the primary x-ray energy to obtain a fractional pulse height. The calculations were performed for 78 cases of 1-Mev primary photons, 71 cases of 5 Mev, 128 cases of 15 Mev, 201 cases of 25 Mev, and 267 cases of 35 Mev. \nThe distributions of fractional pulse heights are plotted in Fig. 2. The ordinate scale is the frequency of events on a logarithmic scale. The pulse height distribution for 1 Mev x-rays shows an extremely poor energy resolution, since almost all pulse heights up to the maximum are equally probable. At 5 Mev, the energy resolution is about 10 percent and is improving with energy. At energies of i5, 25, and 35 Mev the energy resolution is better than 7 percent. \nThese energy resolutions. would have been those found in practice if the energy resolution had been determined solely by the electronic energy retained in the scintillator. However, experiments with betatron $\\mathbf{x}$ -ray spectra and arguments on light collection effciencies indicated that energy resolutions poorer than those predictedwereobtained. \nFiG. 2. Monte Carlo predictions for a xylene (terphenyl) spectrometer. The fractional pulse height distributions are predicted to result from the absorption of monoenergetic x-rays of the energies labeled above each curve. \n\n# \nThe attractivenessof sodiumiodideasthetotal absorption scintillator comes from the large density, high atomic number, large light emission per Mev of electron energy loss, and good optical properties. Other advantages will become obvious from the discussion on the x-ray measurements at energies from ${87~k e v}$ to $17.6~\\mathrm{Mev}$ . In this range, the xylene spectrometer, as it was built, would have been completely unsuitable because the energy resolution was poor and the cosmicray background was large. \nRoughi scaling laws were applied in order to determine the size requirements of the sodium iodide from the experiences with the xylene. On this basis the two sizes, 2 in.by 2 in.by $10\\mathrm{{in}}$ . and 3 in.by 3 in. by $10\\mathrm{in}$ of sodium iodide were selected for the Monte Carlo calculations. The x-ray photons were directed along the long dimension, and were centered on the square crosssection. \n# \n# \nThe detail with which Monte Carlo calculationst had to be performed for sodium iodide was greater than that for xylene. This arises from the high atomic number of sodium iodide which makes necessary the additional detailed examination of the photoelectric, pair production, bremsstrahlung, and annihilation processes. The calculations were performed for 166 cases of primary photons of 4.45 Mev, 66 cases of 16Mevand18casesof $40~\\mathrm{Mev}$ \nThe most significant results of the calculations were the predictions of the pulse height distributions to be expected from a 2-in. by 2-in. by $10\\mathrm{-in}$ . and a 3-in. by 3-in. by 10-in. sodium iodide, total-absorption spectrometer. These results are shown in Fig. 3. Each curve has been averaged from histograms that were based admittedly on poor statistics. Therefore, not too much significance should be placed on the detailed shape of each curve. However, the trends among the three x-ray energies, and from the smaller crystal to the larger crystal, are thought to be significant. Note that the 4.5-Mev pulse height distribution shows evidence of subpeaks due to the escape of one and two annihilation quanta. Note also that the energy resolution obtainable with the 3-in. by 3-in. by 10-in. spectrometer is almost energy independent and is approximately 10 percent."

        "text": "# \nPredictions and  experiments  with  a  small-sized crystal in a total absorption spectrometer can be used as the basis for understanding the results obtainable with larger-sized crystals. Since Monte Carlo calculations for a variety of crystal sizes are tedious, and since large crystals are expensive, the description of the crude extrapolation procedure used by the authors is given here. This method was intended only for $\\pmb{x}\\cdot$ -ray photons with energies greater than 10 Mev. \nThe main features of the pulse height distribution produced by monoenergetic $\\pmb{x}\\cdot$ rays are the percentage energy resolution and the relative pulse height position of the most probable pulse height. If the most probable pulse height'is located at the fractional pulse height of 1 and if the energy resolution is 0 percent, then all of the pulses will be located at one pulse height and the spectrometer is said to operate perfectly. As the most probable pulse height decreases from 1, the percent energy resolution increases approximately in proportion to the decrease in the most probable height. This proportion results from the nature of the cascade process by which an $\\mathbf{x}$ -ray loses energy. Therefore, in the following it is assumed that the most probable pulse height is displaced from 1 by an amount determined by the average loss, $\\Delta E_{T},$ of the initial photon energy, $E_{0},$ from the crystal. Likewise, it is assumed that the energy resolution is given by \n$$\n\\frac{2\\Delta E_{T}}{(E_{0}-\\Delta E_{T})}.\n$$\nThe question  of  extrapolating between different sized crystals resolves itself into a prediction of the average energy loss of photons from the various crystals. \nTo the assumptions on the pulse height distributions was added the assumption that the average energy losses  produced by  finite  radi $(\\Delta E)$ ,and lÃ©ngths $(\\Delta E)_{l}$ are independent. Therefore, the combined average energy loss will be \n$$\n(\\Delta E)\\tau^{2}=[(\\Delta E)\\iota]^{2}+[(\\Delta E)\\tau]^{2}.\n$$\n$(a)$ Efect of radius.â-The Monte Carlo calculations tor the 3-in. by 3-in. by 10-in. sodium iodide crystal showed that an energy resolution of 10 percent or a $(\\Delta E),$ of $0.05~E_{0}$ is obtainable. This imperfect resolution can be assumed to be due entirely to the small size of the crystal in the lateral dimension. The radiation that propagates sideways is composed of annihilation radiation, low energy Compton scattered secondaries, and low energy bremsstrahlung. This energy will be attenuated with an absorption coefficient of approximately 1 Mev radiation, which is $0.544\\mathrm{in.^{-1}}$ . Therefore, the average energy loss produced by a finite radius, ${\\pmb r}_{\\mathrm{:}}$ can be derived by setting the integral of the exponential, constant $\\pmb{x e}^{-0.844\\bar{\\tau}}$ , from 1.8 to infinity,equal to $0.05E_{0}$ Thus it can \nF1G.3.Monte Carlo predictions for a 2-in.by 2-in.by $10{\\cdot}\\mathrm{in}$ and a3-in.by3-in.by $10{\\mathrm{-in}}$ ,NaI(Ti) spectrometer. \nbe shown that \n$$\n(\\Delta E)_{r}{=}0.136E_{0}e^{-0.644r},\n$$\nwhere $\\pmb{\\mathscr{r}}$ is greater than $1.8\\mathrm{{in}}$ \nThe results of this calculation are given in Table I. It will be noted from the values of $(\\%$ energy resolution), that a crystal with a 5 in. diameter cross section will provide an energy resolution that is approximately a factor of 2 better than that obtainable with a 2-in. by 2-in. by 10-in. crystal. \n$\\left(\\delta,\\protect\\right)$ Effect of length.-The absorption coefficient of the $\\mathbf{x}.$ ray energy that determines the shape of the energy absorption versus depth curve in the material governs the length of the speetrometer. Kantz and Hofstadter6 have shown experimentally that the slope of the semilog plot of energy versus depth in copper is somewhat smaller than that obtained from the absorption coefficient, $\\mu_{m}$ of the most penetrating photons.12 \nThe minimum absorption coefficient, $\\mu_{m},$ for sodium iodide is $0.32\\mathrm{in.^{-1}}$ and occurs at 5 Mev. Therefore, in a manner similar to extrapolations described for the radial direction, the average energy loss resulting from a crystal that is $\\iota$ in.long is \n$$\n(\\Delta E)_{\\imath}{=}2.47R E_{0}e^{-0.32\\imath},\n$$\nwhere $\\wr$ is greater than $5\\mathrm{~in~}$ , and $\\pmb{R}$ is the energy resolution obtained experimentally for a 5 in. long, and infnitely wide crystal. An approximation to $\\pmb{R}$ can be found from the measurements with a 2-in. by 2-in. by 5-in. crystal. These results as drawn in Fig. 8 show that $\\pmb{R}$ is approximately 15 percent.
