Without such co-operation the present state of knowledge on the subject could nerer have been attained, confessedly imperfect though it be, and without more aid of the same kind it is not likely to be much increased. \nThe writer will first give a brief and condensed account of the experimental results already arrived at ; he will then enumerate the chief sources of error which must be taken into account in estimating the relative value of such results ; and he will conclude by suggesting a few lines of inquiry and observation, in which the help of practical engineers wouldbeoftheutmostvalue. \nIn the following tabular statement will bc found a list of soine sixty sets of observations of underground temperature arranged according to the average rate of increase of temperature in depth :--"

As to this the most diverse opinions have been held by high authorities.  Sir William Thomson says:-\" All sound naturalists agree that we cannot derire accurate knowledge of underground temperature from mines ; but every bore that is made for the purpose of testing minerals gives an opportunity of observation.\"\\* The late Professor Phillips said:-\" It is in the solid rock that the best obscrvations, and those most suited to the purpose of philosophical reasoning, are to be obtained.\"f On the other hand, Fox and Henwood, to whom is owed more actual work on the subject than to any other savants, thought differently, the foriner saying, “I am disposed to attach most importance to observations on springs of water not coming from the roofs of galleries, or evidently proceeding from higher parts of the mines ;\"t whilst Mr. Jory Henwood, who may be said to have tried all methods, concludes:\" After most careful consideration of the subject, and consultation with others who have also been engaged in this inquiry, it has been thought best to confine the observations as much as possible to the temperature of the streams of water immediately issuing from the unbroken portions of the rocks and veins.\"§  As Mr. Henwood proceeds to show, the temperature of the air of mines is affected by & number of factors which tend to render it very different from that of the rock, and that water fowing through or standing in pools in the levels is exposed to the same modifying causes. \nThe modifying causes alluded to—the presence of workmen, combustion of candles or lamps, ventilation currents, etc.—-do not affect boreholes where convection of the water flling them, and the possible ingress of abnormally warm or cold springs, are the chief vitiating agents. Accordingly, among the observations taken in water, it would appear that those in bore-holes may a priori be presumed to yield the most trustworthyresults. \nBut althongh it is probably right to view observations of temperature in the ordinary air of open mines with considerable suspicion, the case is much altered whcn they are takcn in holes, even of shallow depth, driven \n\\* Transactions of the Geological Society of Glasgow, Vol. III., Part 1, sec. 29.   \n$\\dagger$ Reports of the British Association, Vol. V., page 292 (1836).   \n$\\mathfrak{T}$ Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Corn wall, Vol. 111., page 320.   \n$\\S$ Transactions of the Royal Gieclogical Scciety tf Cornwall, Vol. V.. page 387."

In his book Mr. Fisher gives good reasons for regarding the actual rate of increase as rather higher.\\* For the purposes of this paper, however, the chief interest of the Sperenberg results lies in the fact that an apparatus was in this case successfully used to isolate the thermometer in the bore full of water, and (to a great extant) to stop or impede the action of convection.

        "text": "The third selected example consists of observations taken for the Committee, at the writer's request, at Boldon Colliery, near Sunderland, in 1875, by Mr. Matthew Heckels, then manager of the colliery. \nIn this case special vertical bores some ten feet in length were made from the roof of a quiet part of the workings, and the thermometer was thrust up these holes attached to a stick, the holes being carefully plugged up, and the instruments left for several days, and only taken down to be read from time to time. \nThe observations were taken at 1,365 and 1,514 feet from the surface. The temperature at the former depth was 75 degs. Fahr., at the latter 79 degs. This would give 4 degs. increase for 149 feet; but reckoning from surface mean temperature, which here may be assumed as being 48 degs. Fahr., a much more normal rate is obtained, viz., 1 deg. Fahr. in 49 feet. \nIndeed, nothing is more striking than the fact that, in by far the greater number of good sets of observations, the mean rates of increase cluster about the numbers 1 deg. Fahr. per 50 or 60 feet. \nProfessor Everett seems to give the preference to 1 deg. per 56 feet;\\* the Coal Commission of 1870, with considerably less data than are now arailable, accepted 1 deg. per 60 feet ; and Mr. Fisher takes 1 deg. per 50 to 60 feet a8 the average. \nThat practically is the result arrived at by most of the observations which do not appear to be vitiated by untoward conditions. The chief amongst the latter will be now briefy considered. \nFirst, as regards observations in water. In shafts, stagnant water is liable to variations of temperature according to the seasons even at a considerable depth, and after rainfall or drought. This is well shown in the observations taken by Mr. David Burns, F.G.S., in some of the Allenheads mines (Nos. 3, 6, 36 in Table I.) Discrepancies of this kind were also met with in the upper or “ well\" portion of the Kentish Town hole, as shown by Mr. Symons' results (Nos. 18, 19, 21 in the same Table). But thc chief objection is the wholesale convection which is inseparable from such wide columns of water. \nIn boreholes of considerable depth the effects of changes in surface temperatures are practically nil. Convection is here, however, still a constant source of error. However narrow the bore, convection takes place, and, as a result, thermometric observations taken in them give, not the temperature of the rock at certain depths, but that of the moving water at those depths. Now, if the rock in which the hole is bored is of the same kind from top to bottom, it might be assumed that the convection currents set up by the heat below are uniform, and some correction of sufficiently general application might be used to convert the readings into true rock teinperatures. But, as a rule, a bore passes through very numerous beds of rock of various kinds. Each kind has a special rate of heat-conduction of its own, and the changing conductivities become disturbing elements as regards the conrection of the water.Knowing the absolute conductivity for heat of the various kinds of rock, it might be possible to discover the exact amount of effect produced at cach horizon upon the convection currents, but the necessary calculations have not yet been made."

        "page_idx": 8,
        "text": "A more practical way of lessening the errors due to convection is that of plugging the hole both above and below the thermometer used. In the Sperenberg observations above recorded a very elaborate form of plug was used, which gave very satisfactory results; but its expense, and the amount of trouble required to work it, would prcclude its use in most cases, more especially as bore-rods are necessary for its application. Besides, the Sperenberg bore, being for nearly 4,000 feet entirely in rock salt--i.e. enclosed in walls of homogeneous conductivity for heat comes under the head of exceptional cases. Sand bags have been used as plugs, and so have India-rubber discs arranged along the wire supporting the thermometer in a considerable number of series.  An umbrella-shaped plug, collapsing and expanding by means of a double wire, was devised by the writer for this purpose, and another, also by him, necessitating but a single wire, and acting on the same principle as a safety-cage, viz., falling freely so long as the wire remains taut, expanding and gripping the sides as soon as the wire is let go. To all these appliances there are objections in practice, and so far, the Sperenberg observations remain the only really successful ones with plugs for stopping or checking convection. \nSprings or feeders of water at various horizons in a bore are a source of error, which must be of very usual occurrence, and which it is almost impossible to guard against. In some districts such springs may have, as Mr. Henwood held, practically the same temperature as the bed of rock from which they issue, and the error due to them may be correspondingly small, but often the feeders may be of much higher temperature, and must vitiate all readings takcn in their vicinity. In the case of Mr. Henwood's Cornish obserrations, all of which were taken in springs issuing at various depths in mines, their great number, and the care and judgment with which they were selected and carried out, give great weight to the means deduced from them. Thus No. 7 in Table I. is the mean of 415 observations of this kind. They were distributed as follows among the principal mining districts of Cornwall and Devon :\\*-"

This would seem at first sight to be a very easy matter; but in practice much annoyance is caused by the lengthening—-unequal lengthening the writer has more than once found it to beof the wires used to suspend the instrument. A drum coupled with a mechanical counter is the most useful form of apparatus for lowering and raising thermometers in bores, the best wire for the purpose being pianoforte wire, which is much less liable to changes of length than the copper wire generally employed. (A drum of this kind, designed by Mr. Lindsay Galloway for the use of the British Association Committee, was exhibited to the meeting.) \nFormerly, self-registering thermometers were commonly used, but the shaking, which it is all but impossible to avoid in raising them from any great depth in narrow bores, was so apt to displace the index that they are now given up. The instruments now recommended are of the type of Negretti and Zambra's so-called “ mining thermometer,”\" where the bulb is surrounded by a non-conducting substance, usually paraffin. Very slow action is thus ensured, and, after being left a suffcient time at any particular depth to mark the degree of temperature at that horizon, the mercury will remain practically stationary during the short time necessary to haul up the instrument. \nAttention has already been called to the conductivity for heat of various rocks, as affecting the convection currents in the water filling \\* See Cornwall Geological Transactions, Vol. V.. page 402."

        "text": "boreholes. The actual rate of increase of temperature in going downwards depends upon this same conductivity, such increase being more rapid as the index of conductivity is lower, slower as the rocks are better conductors. But it has been found that the index of conductivity of a rock when dry is very different from that exhibited by the same rock when wet; the latter offering far less resistance to the passage of heat than the former. This makes another source of error pertaining to observations in wet bores which should not be lost sight of. \nThe conductivity for heat of fissile or laminated rocks also varies according to the position of the lamina withregard to that of the source of heat. Rocks of this kind, when vertical, conduct heat more rapidly than when horizontal, when dipping than when fat.  Here there is another source of error due to conductivity. This one, like the last, can probably be fairly corrected, so far as shallow depths are concerned, now that the absolute conductivities of so many rocks are known, thanks to .the arduous labours of Prof. A. S. Herschel,\\* only recently completed. But at great depths the rocks are no longer at ordinary temperature, and it is not to be assumed that at very high temperatures the index of conductivity for heat of any substance will be the same as at comparatively low ones. For errors possibly due to this cause there is as yet no correction, experiments on this portion of the subject being still a desideratum. \nConnected with the general low conductivity for heat of most rocks is the extraordinary time required before the heat due to boring operations is lost in bores of considerable depth, be they wet or dry. Many most carefully conducted observations have been rendered valueless from being made too soon after the boring tools have becn removed. There are few exact data on this subject at present, but Mr. W. Galloway is now investigating it for the British Association Committe. It is, however, proved by many sets of readings (e.g. Nos. 31, 41, 52 in Table I.) that, under certain conditions, months may elapse before the water or air at the bottom of a deep bore regains a temperature at all representing that of the surrounding rock. This is a point on which persons practically acquainted with boring might give exceedingly valuable information. Even in the short hand-bores used in dry-air observations of the Boldon Collery type a certain amount of time must be allowed to elapse before readings aretaken. \nThe form of the surface should be considered in estimating the value of temperature observations taken even at great depths below it. A point in the ground vertically under a steep crest is more exposed to the cooling infuence of the air than a point at the same depth beneath 8 plain. The decrease of temperature upwards is about three and a half times more rapid in the air than in the rock, and the curves of the planes of equal temperature below ground will therefore necessarily be affected by the greater or less degree of convexity in the great surface features of the ground above. This is 8 point which must chiefy be kept in view in discussing observations taken in mountainous regions, such as those in short dry bores in the Mont Cenis, St. Gothard, and Hoosac Tunnels, in all of which very elaborate series of experiments on subterranean temperature have been and are being made (No. 51 in Table I.)"

In the inines on the Great Comstock lode, as every one knows, temperatures abnormally high are found —-s0 abnormal indeed that they have been omitted from the Table in the present paper as being useless for comparisons with ordinary readings. Temperatures, not so unusually great as those of the Comstock lode, were found in the Schemnitz mines, in Hungary (43 to 47 in Table I.); others, also very irregular, in some bores in the immediate neighbourhood of lead veins in North Wales, taken recently with great care by Mr. Strahan of H.M. Geological Survey. Examples of this sort might be multiplied, showing that in connexion with mineral veins a normal or regular rate of increase of temperature is not to be counted on.What this may be due to it is not always easy to say,but with the facts before us it seems fair to conclude that chemical action is at the root of the matter. The decomposition of the metallic sulphides, which form the greater part of the mineral contents of most metalliferous veins, give rise to great heat. Some hot inineral springs are traceable to this cause. Other chemical decompositions may cause a lowering of the temperature at certain points within the interior of the earth's crust. To be on the safe side, therefore, it is necessary to exclude, or at any rate receive only with diffdence, all observations taken in the neighbourhood of mineral veins, when such observations are abnormal in character. When, as in the case of Mr. Henwood's remarkable series of experiments mentioned above, the results show no violent difference from those in regularlybedded and unfaulted districts, it may be accepted then as a proof that chemical decomposition is working there but on a very small scale. \nAgain,there is noreasonto assume that movements of the earth's crust ●Beobachtungen ueber die Temperatur des Gesteins in verschiedenen Tiefen in den Gruben des Sachsischen Erzgebirges, p. 87."

The chief desiderata have been enumerated one by one as each chief source of error has come under notice. \nIn conclusion, the writer begs to disclaim any pretensions to originality in the present paper, nothing in which is new but its arrangement, and perhaps some of the views as to the worthlessness of certain observations. \nThe PREsIDENT said, the members would join with him in passing 8 vote of thanks to Professor Lebour for the paper he had read. The heat of underground strata was a subject which affected deep mining very much indeed, and, of course, as years went on, and the upper beds of coal were worked off, this subject would affect them much more. He was sure that the members of the Institute would be glad to co-operate with Mr. Lebour in obtaining such information as he desired. So far as he was concerned, he could promise the Professor a series of observations underthe sea. \nMr. Bewick hoped that Mr. Lebour would, in the tabular statements embodied in his paper, give the geological formation in which the observations were taken. Allusion had been made to the temperature in some observations made at Allenheads, but the results would depend upon the period of the week at which they were taken. A large number of men and some horses were employed, and powder was exploded ; all which would tend to cause some variation according to the time at which the observations were made. Then, again, the proximity of veins would be an interesting matter to consider. There were a great many veins of different characters, containing lead, zinc, and copper ores, pyrites, and other matters ; these and even the direction of the wind might affect the observations taken atAllenheads."

        "text": "Professor LEBoUR said, he would give the geological formations in which the observations were taken when they were known ; some of those who had takcn the other observations had been careless. He believed the observations at Allcnheads were taken in shafts under water. The shafts were the High Underground Engine Shaft and the Gin Hill Shaft;andhementioned these observations to showthedifferenceafter a drought and after rain. The obscrvations in the shafts at Allenheads were taken by Mr. D. Burns, F.G.S., in water in 1871. Otherwise he thoughtthese observations in shaftswere almostworthless. \nMr. BewicK—-Both the shafts mentioned are working shafts, and the observations must have becn taken in the sump-hole. \nMr. BoyD said, one circumstance had struck him forcibly, namely, whether the incrcased temperature was entirely due to the superincumbent strata, or whether the sea level had any infuence upon it. For instance, in piercing the Mont Cenis tunnel a temperature of 90 degs. was observed, which was considerably more than that cbtained at depths very much nearertothecentreoftheearth. \nMr.CookE asked Professor Iebour whether the increased temperature might be due to heat being rendered sensible which had been latent on account of the compression in great depths, either in water, or air, or solid rock, that is, in fact, whether thc pressure has anything to do with the increasing heat? He reminded them of the popular lecturer setting fire totinder by the sudden compression of air in a cylinder,and of the necessity of cooling appliances, where air-compressing engines are used. \nProfessor LeBouR said, pressure by itself could not develop heat. Itwas onlywheremotionwasdestroyedasmotionthatitwasconverted into heat. Therefore, there was no reason for imagining that increase of temperature asdescentwasmadebelowtheearth'ssurfacecouldbedue to the pressure of the overlying rocks, or “ cover.\" \nMr. BiRD asked Professor Iebour if there were not instances of variation in the same borehole. If there was a borehole 3,0oo feet deep, was not the rate of incrcase different at the first thousand, and at the second thousand, and at the third thousand ? \nProfessor LEBouR said, Mr. Bird had touched upon & point which was the very pith of the whole matter. These differences in the increase of temperature were among the difficulties of theobservations.Hedid not know of any observations where they did not get differences of this kind. If they took two or three cases where there were observations every 50 or 100 feet, and took the difference between the temperature at 100 feet, and the temperature at the lowest depth (unless an abnormal one), they would find that the mean was something like 1 in 56 in most instances. Between those two they found great variations of all kinds in the rate: they sometimes found even decrease, and not increase. He cast aside all minor matters because they interfered with the general results which seemed to be generally established. If anyone would study the minor matters, and give the result of his observations, he would do great service to science.  It was almost impossible for anyone not acquainted with localities to explain carefully the discrepancies in each case. If people connected with a locality would attend to the facts of that locality, they would do great service."

        "text": "Mr. BiRD understood Mr. Lebour to mean that if these matters were eliminated the rate of increase would be found to be uniform in one place, with a few exceptions. \nProfessor LEBoUR said that was so. \nMr. BoyD proposed, and Mr. Bird seconded, a vote of thanks to Mr. Lebour for his most interesting paper, which was nnanimously carried, and the discussion was adjourned."
