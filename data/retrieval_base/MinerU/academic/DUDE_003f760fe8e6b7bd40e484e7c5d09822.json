        "text": "No. XI. \n# \n# \n# \nReferring to the precautions taken at the_National Vaccinc Establishmcnt to secure purity of lymph, DR. CAMERON contended that they were at best based upon a very questionable theory, and were altogether inadequate to prevent the collection of lyinph from infants in whom disease could only be detected on a close and minute cxamination, such as those who had proved the source of So much mischief in MR. HUTcHINSON'S and some of M. DEPAUL'S Cases.\\*\\*\\* \nM. DEPAUL, the chief of the Vaccination Service of the Frcnch Acadciny of Medicine, becaine alivc to the danger of the spread ofsyphilitic infection through vaccination. In a paper which M. DEPAUL published in $\\mathbf{I}\\tilde{8}67$ .which einbraced the record of little ovcr a year's French experiencc, there were enumerated half-a-dozen inore or less extensive outbrcaks of vaccinal syphilis, in the course of which upwards of 16o children had becn infected, and several had lost thcir lives. It was not until $\\mathbf{I}^{8}7\\mathbf{I}$ that a case of wholesale syphilitic invaccination, brought bcfore the Royal Medical and Surgical Society by MR. JoNATHAN HUTCHINSON, incontestibly proved to the mcdical profession in this country that the theory on which they had so long relied was unsound.-DR. CHARLEs CAMERON, M.P. Address at the London Calf Lymph Medical Conference, Dcc., 1879. \n# \nAt  thc ordinary mccting of thc Royal Medlico-Chirurgical Society, held on the gth Deceinber, $\\mathbf{\\underset{-}{1}879}$ MR.HUTCIIINSON describeet a case of Vaccinia Gangrcnosa, and exhibited thc body of the infant, who had been vaccinated three months before death, from the arn of a healthy child. Three other children vaccinated at the same time, froin thc same source, took no hurt. On the eighth day after vaccination, a papular and vesicular rash appeared over the trunk, which rapidly assumed a sloughing character. The eruption was at first taken for small-pox, and when death took place, a fortnight later, an inquest was held on the casc, for it was then thought to be syphilis. But MIR. HUrcHINsON pointed out that its evolution as well as its character were not those of syphilitic infection, and he considered it to be a true case of vaccinia passing on to a gangrenous condition--a condition he had sometimes observed to take place in varicella. ‘The vaccine marks_ on the arm were natural.—MR. JONATHAN HUTCHINSON, F.R.C.S., &c. The Lancct, December 13th, 1879, P. 873."

        "text": "# \nJENNER had already observed phlegmonous erysipelas to follow vaccination. And in the Foundling Hospital at Petersburg, of $5,000$ vaccinated infants, 57 took erysipelas in conserquence of vaccination and died. Also in' Boston, erysipelas has ‘been seen to follow upon vaccination ; and on various occasions vaccination has had to be suspended.—DR. C. SPINzit, St. Louis, U.S. 1S8o. \n# \nOne pernicious practice, is that of vaccinating children. I am as afraid of the virus as I am of the small-pox. Not only scrofula. but other impurities have been conveyed to the blood of healthy persons by means of vaccination. No one, who has given the subject the least consideration,_ doubts that impurities may be conveyed in this manner.—Dk. A. G. SpRINGsTEEN, Cleveland, Ohio. $\\dot{\\Lambda}\\dot{\\tau}_{C4},~\\mathfrak{j}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{o}}\\gamma\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Pi}},$ Mledical T'ribune,January,IS8o. \n# \nThere has fallen an ugly blot. It is too certain that one objection really formidable does exist--that the operation may, in some few instances, impart to the subject of it the poison of a hateful and destructiye disease (syphilis), peculiar to the human species, and the fruit and Nemesis of its vices. On this distasteful subject I shall simply appeal to the printed testimony of MR. JoNATHAN HUTCHIN.ON. Such facts as he has demonstratcd, eonstitute a rational excuse for objecting to compulsory vaccination canreadilysympathiseoith,andevenapplaudafatherwho,with the presumed dread or misgiving in his mind, is willing to submit to multiplied judicial pcnalties, rather than cxpose his child to the risk Of an affection so ghastly.—SIR THOMAs WATSON, BART., M.D., F.R.S., D.C.L.Nineteenth Century, June, 188o."

BoyLE, MI.B., C.MI., L.M.Lancet, April 3rd, i88o. \n# \nI havc now under treatment a girl who has an cruption, not unlike small-pox, on her shoulders, arms, and face, and which causes her intolerable itching. She was vaccinatcd 18 years ago, and has an eruption cvcry summer of a similar kind to that which followed shortly after having bcen vaccinatcd. At these times she is greatly debilitated and looks thoroughly out of health. 1have also just givcn up attending a gentleman who, having suffcred from chronic cczema on the arms and legs, was recommended to try the experiment recorded in DR. JosEPH KIDD's book on Thcrapeutics (page 98), and get vaccinated with a view to cure. 'The result was a great increase of thc diseasc, which almost drove him to despair. He isnow nearly wcll. l have also seen an cruption, almost indistinguishable from small-pox, coming out on a paticnt round the site of the vaccine vesicle in a ring of sevcral inches circumfcrence. In this case no furthcr harm resulted, but l am inclincd to think that those cases which are said “ not to take \" arc those in which the vital organs are most likcly to bc injuriously affected.—DR.

        "text": "# \nWhen a given (animal) body is possessed by one of them, (contagious diseases) no product of that body can be warranted as safe not to convey the infection. Presumption against every part and product of the diseased body is by every one readily admitted, where therc are vehement general symptoms of disease ; but it is important to know that not only in such febrile states, but even in states of chronic dyscrasy, and even at times when the dyscrasy may be giving no outward sign, thc infected body may be variously infective. Thus the vaccine lymph of the syphilitic may possibly contain the syphilitic contagion in full vigour, even at moments when the patient who thus shows himself infective, has not on his own person any outward activity of syphilis. Similarly in regard to tubercular disease.--MR. SIMoN, F.R.C.S.  British Mcdical Fourmal, Dec. 13th, 1879. \n# \nIn various classcs, cspccially in large towns, not only was there doubt whcther vaccination was effcctual as a prevention, but therc was an excccdingly grcat fear that diseases even more to be dreaded than small-pox itsclf werc conveycd by vaccine matter.- DR.BREwER, M.P.House of Commons. \n# \nI have, in a forty ycars practice, seen far more evil than gob from vaccination, and thereforc vaccinated my own children only in their third and fourth years, when they were hearty and strong.
