The percentages correctly classified “sick”or“well” when results from Sample 1 were used to predict Sample 2 and vice versa were $82\\%$ and $85\\%$ by theregression methodand $86\\%$ and $86\\%$ by the SEQUIN method. Seven items,perhaps representing general attributes defining mental illness in the Navy culture, contributed significantly to the predictive scales regardless ofparticular item selection method or sample. \nThe Cornell Medical Index (CMI) has been widely used as an aid to clinical diagnosis （Brodman,Erdmann,& Wolff,1956; Erdmann,1959) and as a measure of the prevalence of somatic and emotional symptoms in various populations （Abramson, Terespolsky,Brook,&Kark,1965).The Index hasrepeatedly demonstratedvalidity as an indicator of general health or of emotional health when compared with clinical ratings,but has proved less useful as an indicator of the presence of specific diseases orin comparing health status indifferent populations and cultures (Abramson,1966). In a previous study of the Navy population, the total CMI score （the number of “yes responses over the entire 195-item health questionnaire) discriminated efficiently betweenpsychiatric inpatients and healthy controls using a cutting score of 15 （Arthur, Gunderson,& Richardson,1966).This result suggested that the CMI might have potential value as a psychiatric screening device andas an epidemiological tool in the Navy setting. \nThe next logical step in developing a useful screening indexwas to identify the specific items in the CMI which best differentiate patients from healthy controls and to determine themost efficient combination of these items.It seemed plausible thata short scale ofhighly selected itemsmight be devised which could discriminate mentally ill from healthy individuals in the Navy population as well as the entire CMI inventory. \n\n# \n# \nThe Ss for the study were 630 psychiatric inpatients from two naval hospitals and a normal controlgroupof 454 enlistedmen who werecurrentlyon active duty and were not medical or psychiatric patients at the time of the study.The control group consisted of students from an electronics technicians school, Marine guards, hospital corpsmen,and Navy enlisted men from several occupational categories on duty ata West Coast naval station,and participants in underwater demolition training.The mean ages of the patient group and thecontrol groupwere22 yr.and $21\\mathrm{\\bf~yr}.$ ,respectively.Distributions in pay grade (rank) were approximately the same for both patients and controls, although seamen recruits were represented in the patient group but not in the control group. \n# \nCMI questionnaires were administered individually or in groups by medical personnel at the various facilities included in the study.The total sample of 1,084 patients andcontrols as divided into two subgroups for purposes of cross-validation by sorting on odd or even last digits of service numbers. By this method, 560 cases were selected for SampleI,of whom 335were patients and 225 were controls.The composition of Sample II was 295 patients and 229 controls,for a total of 524 Ss."

        "text": "The frequency of “yes”responses given by patients and controls for all 195 CMI items was examined,and, on the basis of the differences in percentages answering “yes,”60 items were chosen for intensive analyses.The regression technique was used to select themost discriminating of the 60 items and to determine regression weights for sets of items derived separately from Samples I and II.The regression weights from Sample I then were used to predict the patient versus control criterion inSampleII $0=$ control, ${\\mathfrak{1}}=$ patient),and,similarly,regression weights from Sample II were used to predict the illness criterion in Sample I.An alternative method of item selection and weighting, called SEQUIN （Moonan &Pooch,1966),also was used for cross-validation.The most important difference between the two methods is the assignment ofunit weights to items selected by the SEQUIN method as opposed to the assignment of variable weights in the regression method. \nCorrelations were computed by the product-moment method for the cross-validities as well as the regression analysis and by the biserial method for the SEQUIN analysis; the two methods of correlation yielded identical results in the present analyses. \n# \nTable 1 presents the items,correlations with the criterion,and the regression coeffcientsderived fromSamplesIandIl.‘The items most highlycorrelated withthe criterion in both samples were,“Does worrying continually get you down?\"and “Are you considered a nervous person? The item, \"Were you ever a patient in a mental hospital(for your nerves)?”had relatively large regression weights in both samples.Of all CMI questions,theseitemsmost directlyrefer tosevere emotional disturbance.Substantial weights were received by the items,“Do you smoke more than 20cigarettes aday?”“Do you suffer badlyfrom frequentsevereheadaches?\"and “Do you need glasses to read?” Therelationship of these items tomental illness is less obvious than the relationships of the aforementioned items;however,headaches,reading difficulties,and excessive smoking are commonly recognized concomitants of emotional distress.Various specific emotional symptoms, for example,“shy or sensitive,”“frightening thoughts”and “unhappy and depressed\"contribute to discrimination in one or the other sample,but are less consistent than the previously mentioned items. \n\nTABLE1 CORRELATIONS AND REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS FOR CORNELL MEDICAL INDEX (CMI) ITEMSSELECTED BY THE REGRESSION METHOD \n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\nItem no. & CMI section & Item & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{SampleI} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{SampleII} \\\\\n &  &  & p8 & Regres- sionco- efficient &  & Regres- sionco- efficient \\\\\n1 & A & Do you need glasses to read? & .23 .41 & .13 & .27 & .16 \\\\\n79 & G & Doyou suffer badly from frequent severe headaches? &  & .13 & .38 .39 & .14 -.11 \\\\\n113 & I & Doyou suffer from severe nervous exhaustion? & .30 & .12 & .32 & .11 \\\\\n133 & K & Areyou definitelyunderweight?

Itis clear that selection of items by linear multiple regression or similar techniques can provide great economies in scoring the present CMI questionnaire and at the same time slightly increase validity as well. Scoring only from 12to15itemsbymeansofregression weights or unit weights resulted in concurrent validities consistentlyhigher than those attained with scores based on unit weights for all 195 items in a previous study.² Splithalf cross-validation results indicated high stability and comparability for the various briefpredictor scales obtained. \nThe apparent superiority of the SEQUIN method of item selection for scale cross-validations suggests that simple counting of diagnostic answers (\"yes\") would be preferable"

This simplicity of scoring would offer practical advantages for many clinical settings. Alarge proportionof the items included in thevarious experimental scaleswasdrawn fromSectionsM-Rof the CMI questionnaire. These items were designed to elicit psychological symptoms,and it is not surprising that they are the most discriminating with respect to mental illness.Three items from SectionL—itemsusuallynot scored as emotional symptoms-also were highly significant correlates of diagnosed mental disorder.These items—“Do you usuallyhave great difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep?”“Do you smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day?\" and “Do you drink more than six cups of coffee or tea a day?\"should be included in scales designedtoestimate mental health status in the naval population. \nSeven“universal'items emerged from the various analyses; that is,items which contributed significantly to thepredictive scales regardless ofparticular item-selection method or sample.These questions perhaps represent asetof generalattributes which aremost important in defining mental illness in the Navy culture.The items, in order of importance,are,“Does worrying continually get you down?\"“Are you considered a nervous person?\"Do you smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day?\"Do you suffer badly from frequent severe headaches?\"“Are you definitely underweight?\"\"Were you ever a patientinamental hospital （for your nerves)?“Do you need glasses to read? These items appear to offer a useful nucleus of questions for a brief psychiatric index. Other questions could be added as their relevance was consistently demonstrated. \nUsing different methods of item selection, Abramson etal.（1965) deviseda scale of 10 “key”CMI items（Hebrew version)which correlatedhighly $(r=.63)$ withphysicians ratings of emotional health in arandomly selected sample of Jerusalemmales. Seven of these 10 key items appeared in the experimental scales of the present study, suggesting a surprising generalityin thepresentfindings. Studies of therelationships ofbrief mental health index scores to psychiatrists' decisions concerning fitness for duty and need for hospitalization arein progress,and the effects of social and cultural differences upon healthquestionnaire responses also are being evaluated. \n\nBecause the predictive value of the brief, CMIscalesderivedin this studyhasnotyet been tested, the accuracy and usefulness of these scoring techinques for diagnostic purposes with newor suspected patientsremain tobe demonstrated,and they obviously should not be used for intake screening until such verificationcanbeachieved. \n# \nABRAMsoN,J.H.
