        "text": "This memorandum addresses the question whether a federal district court would properly have jurisdiction to cntertain a petition for a wnit of habeas corpus filed on behalf of an alien detained at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (\"GBC\"). This question has arisen because of proposals to detain al Qaeda and Taliban members at GBC pending possible trial by military commission. If a federal district court were to take jwrisdiction over a habeas petition, it could review the constitutionality of the detention and the use of a military commission, the application of certain treaty provisions, and perhaps even the legal status of al Qaeda and Taliban membars. \nWe cooclude that tbe great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properiy exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at GBC. Nonetheless, we canmot say with absolute certainty that any such petition would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. A detainee could make a non-frivolous argument that jurisdiction does exist over aliens detained at GBC, and we have found no decisions that clearly foreclose the exjptence of habeas jurisdiction there. On thc otber hand, it docs not appear that any federal court has allowed a babeas petition to procced from GBC, either. Wbile we believe that the cornect answer is that federal courts lack jurisdiction over habeas petitions filed by alien detainees held outside the sovereign teitory of the Umited States, tbere remains some litigation risk that a district court might reach the opposite result. \n# \nThe basis for demying jurisdiction to entertain a habeas petition filed by an alien held at GBC rests on Joknson v.Eisentrager,339 U.S. 763 (1950).In that casc, the Supreme Court held that federal courts did not have authority to entertain am application for habeas relief fled by an cpemy alien who had been seized and held at all relevant times outside the teritory of the United aid the Japanesc in China after Gemmany had surendered in April 1945. They were seized, tried by military commission in Nanking. China and subsequently impnisoned in Gemmany.From there, they filed an application for habcas corpus in the District Court for the District of Columbia, naming as respondents the Secretary of Defense, Secrctary of the Ammy, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Id. at 766-67. The Court concluded that the federal courts were without power to grant babeas relief because the plaintiffs were beyond the territorial sovereignty of the United States amd outside the temitonial jwnisdiction of any U.S. court. As the Court cxplained:"

        "text": "We have pointed out that the privilegc of litigation bas been extended to aliens, whether friendly or cnemy, only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection. No such basis can be invoked hcre, for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any temitory over which the United States is sovereign,-amd-the-seenes-of-bair-ofense,-their-captume,_tbcir_trial_ and_their pumishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States \nId. at 777-78. \nThe Court seemed to acknowledge tacitly that the babeas application could fall within the literal terms of the federal statute defining the powrer of federal courts to grant habeascorpus relief. Then, as now, the statute did not cxpressly restrict the jurisdiction of courts to issue the writ solely to situations where.a prisoner was held within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. Instead, the stahute states simply that courts may gant the wit \"within their respcctivc jurisdictions.\" See 28 U.S.C. g 2241 (1994) (\"Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Cout, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions.). It has been held sufficient for jurisdiction to grant the writ if a pcrson with authornity over the custody of the prisoner is within the jurisdiction of tbe court.' The Supremc Cout assumcd that, \"while [thc] prisoners are im immediate physical custody of an officer or officers not parties to the procceding, respondents named in the petition have lawful authority to effect their release. 339 U.S. at 766-67. The Court, however, reasoned that tbc answer to the court's power did not lie in the stahutc. Rather, it explained that, for the question before it, \"answers stem directly from fumdamentals,” aod that they “cannot be found by casual concluded that an alien held outside the United States cannot seek the wit of habeas corpus."

        "text": "The analysis from Eisentrager should apply to bar any habeas application filed by an alien held at GBC. In the critical passage that most nearly summarizes the Court's bolding, the Eisentrager Court based its conclusion on the fact that the prisoners were seized, tried, and held in termitory that was outside the sovereignty of the United States and outside the temitorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.We do not believe that the Cout intended to cstablish a two-part test, distinguishing between \"sovereignterritory amd temitorial \"jurisdiction.\" Instead, we believe that the Court used the latter term interchangeably with the former to explain why an alien has no right to a writ of habeas corpus when held outside the sovereign territory of the United States. The samc reasoning applies to GBC because it is outside the sovereigm temitory of the United States. \nThe United States holds GBC tnder a lease agrcement with Cuba entered into in 1903. See Agreement Between the United States of America amd the Republic of Cuba for the Lease to the United States of Lands in Cuba for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 16-23, 1903, U.S.-Cuba, T.S. No. 418, 6 Bevans 1113 (Lease Agrcement).' That agreemcnt cxpressly provides that \"the United States recognizes the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the\" lands and waters subject to the lease. Id. art. ll. Ahtbough the agreemcnt goes on to state that the United States \"shall exercise complete junisdicbion and control over and within\" the leased areas, it specifieally reserves sovereignty to Cuba. Id. \nThe terms of the Lease Agreement are thus definitive on the qocstion of sovereignty and should cot be subject to question in the courts. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “thc determination of sovereigoty over an area is for the legislative and executivc departments\"- that is, it is not a question on which the courts should second-guess the political branches. YermilyaBrowm Co. v. Connell, 335 U.S. 377, 380 (1948)..Indeed, in Vermiba-Brown all nine membcns of the Supreme Court observed that the United States has no sovereignty over GBC. The issue in Fermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, was whether the Fair Labor Standards Aet (\\*FLSA\") applicd to a United States military base in Bermuda: Five members held that the FLSA applied to “foreign territory under lease for bases,\" id. at 390, while the four dissenters concluded that the FLSA applied only in “any Temitory or possession of the United States,\" id. (Jackson, $I_{u}$ dissenting). All nine believed, however, that neither Benmuda nor GBC was subject to the sovereignty of the United States. \nAt the time when Vermibya-Brown was decided, the United States was operating military bases in Bermuda pursuant to a 99-year leaschold. That lease ended in September 1, 1995, when both bases were closed and the land rehurmed to the Govcinment of Bermuda. See id. at 378; see alsowww.virtualsourccs.com/Countries/Europe%20Countries/Bermuda.htm.Basedon the arangements wnder which the [United States'] leased bases [of Bermuda] were acquired from Great Britain did not and werc not intended to transfer sovereignty over the leased areas from Great Britain to the United States.\" 335 U.S. at 380. Accordingly, those five justices concluded \"that the leased area is under the sovereignty of Great Britain and that it is not teritory of the United States in a political scnse, that is, a part of its national domain.\" Id. at 380-81. Moreove, the majority specifically stated that the United States also has “a lease from the Republic of Cuba of an area at Goantanamo Bay for a coaling or naval statbion.,\" and that \"[tjhe United States was granted by the Cuban lease substantially the same nights as it has in the Bermuda lease.\\* Id at 383 & n.5 (quoting 1903 US-Cuba agrcemcnt)."

        "text": "Similarly. the dissent contended that \\*Benmuda and likc bases ane not . . . our posscssions.\" Jd. at 392 (Jackson, $J_{\\parallel}$ dissenting). “Guantanamo Naval Basc, : : a leased basc in Cuba ... has been niled by the Attomey General not to be a possession; if has not'beea listed'bythe State Department as among our \\*non-self-goveming temitonies,' and thc Administrator.of ibe \\* Yery Act before us has not listed it among our possessions.\" Id. at 405 (Jackson, J., disscnting), (footnotes omitted). Tbe disagrcement in the case was not wbcther the United Statcs cxcrcised sovercignty over GBC - all agreed that the United States did not - but rather whether the FLSA applies cxtratemitorially to include U.S. military bases such as tbosc in Benmuda and GBC. Thc Eisenirager analysis tums, of coursc, on whether the United States cxercises sovereignty over a particular territory. \nThe Fermibya-Brown decision does not stand alone in concluding tbat the United States does not cxercise sovereignty over GBC. More recently, in 1995, the Eleventh Cireuit similarly relied on the temms of the Lease Agreemcnt to conclude that GBC is not within the sovereign temitory of the United States. See Cuban American Bar Ass'n, Inc. v. Chrisiopher, 43 F.3d 1412, 1425 (11th Cir. 1995) (The district court here cred in concloding that Guantanamo Bay was a \\*United States temitory.' We disagree that \\*contol and jurisdiction' is·equivalent to sovereignty.) (citations omitted): id. (rcjccting “the argument that our leased military bases abroad which contimuc under the sovercignty of foreign nations, hostile or fiendly. are \\*functiomal[ly] cquivalent to bcing land borders or ports of entry of the United States or otherwise within the Umited States\") (alteration in original). And the District of Comnecticut has likewise held that “sovereignty over the Guantanamo Bay does not rest with the United States.\" Bird v. United States, 923 F. Supp. 338, 343 (D. Comm. 1996). :See also id (\\*Because the 1903 Lease of Lands Agreement clearly establishes Cuba as the de jure sovereign over Gulitanamo Bay, this Court need not speculate whether tbe United States is the de facto sovereign over the \nThe position of GBC stands in sharp cootrast to the status of the Philippine Islands in cases arising out of World War IL General Yamashita was tied in the Philippines by a U.S. military commission from October to December of 1945, and the Supreme Court chose to exercise habeas juisdiction i reviewing the commission's decision\"See Applicanion of Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 5 (1946). At that time, bowever, the Philippine Islands was an msular. possession of the United States, and not a mere U.S. leasebold interest.See Eiseutrager, 339. U.S. at 78o (\\*By reason of our sovereignty at that time over these insular possessions, Yamashita stoodmuch as did Quirin before American courts. Yamashita's offenses were committed on our temitory of the United States.). The United States exercised sovereignty over the Philippines until July 4, 1946, see generally 48 U.S.C. ch. 5 (1994), at which time the Philippines became an independent sovereign. The United States retarined a military base there - and it was that condition which the Vermilya-Brown Court compared to Bermuda and GBC. See VermihygBrown, 335 U.S. at 384 & n.7. The Court's treabnent of the Philippines after July 4, 1946, thus affirms our conclusion that the United States interest in GBC today is markedly different, for Eisentraeer purposes, than that in the Philippines prior to July 4, 1946."

See 28 U.S.C. 55 81-131 (1994); 48 U.S.C.55 1424, 1424b, 1821-1826 (1994). GBC is not included within the temitory defined for any district.

See Memorandum for the Associate Alttorney General. from Lamy L. Simms, Deputy Assistant Attomcy General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Status of Guantanamo Bay (Oct. 27, 1981).

        "text": "For the reasons outlined above, we believe that the rationale for holding that there is no jurisdiction to entertain a babeas petition from an alien beld at GBC is very strong and is the correct result under Eisentrager. Nevertheless, we caution that there is a potential ground for uncertainty arising from an arguable imprecision in the Supreme Court's language.in Eisentrager. As noted above, in a critical passage the Court stated that habeas jurisdiction was not available because the aliens were not within “temitory over which the United States is sovereign.\"_339 UL.S. at 778. In the very same sentence, however, the Court also stated that habeas jurisdiction did not exist because the events and detention occurred outside “the temitonial juisdiction” of amy federal court.Id.If an alien detaincc is both outside the United States\\* sovereign territory and outside the temitonial junisdiction of a federal court, then it is clear that no habeas junsdiction exists.We have explained above that we believe GBC mects those conditions. A non-frivolous argument might be constructed, however, that GBC, while not part of sovereign temitory-of the-United States, is-within-the-temtonal-junisdiction-ofa-federal.cow.. In that scenanio, the applieation.of Eisentrager. might.not be as clear. Thus_is becanse \"sovereignty” over temitory and jurisdiction” over temitory could mean diferent things.A nation, for example, can retain its sovereignty over its jemitory, yet at the same time allow another nation to exercise limited jwrisdiction within it. \nIt might be argued that the difference in language in Eisentrager must be given meaning. which can only be done if there is a difference between sovereigmtyand jurisdictionA court could find that the U.S.-Cuba lease agrecment lends itself rather well to.this distinction, since it makes clear that the United States exercises “complete jurisdiction and control\" over GBC, even though Cuba retains \"sovercignty.\" Lease Agrecment, 6 Bevans 1114. Although Eisenrrager seems to permit aliens to bring habeas petitions only in areas within the sovereign control of the United States, which by the 1903 agreement does not extend to GBC, a court could find that Eisentrager's mention of territorial jurisdiction does not preclude habeas jurisdiction at GBC. \nA. district cout also might find support in some cases, although (as explained bclow) we believe that these precedents are not good law. In Haitian Centers Council, Inc. v. MeNary, 969 F.2d 1326 (2od Cir. 1992), the Second Cireuit stated that “Guantamamo Bay is a military ( installtion that is subject to the exchusiwe control and jurisdiction of the United States, Id. at 1342.As a result of the United Stales'cxclusive control, the court concluded that some constitutional rights applied to Haitian refugees held at GBC and that an interest group tould fle for a preliminary injunction in federal court in New York to vindicate those nights. The. court also relied in part on the fact that certain U.S. criminal laws apparently applied to GBC under thc definition of the United States“specinl maritime and temitonial jurisdicbion\" in section 7 of tile 18, United States Code. See id. at 1342. That placcd GBC, at least in some sensc, under US. \"jurisdiction\" Similarly, in Haitian Centers Council, Inc. v. Sale, 823 F. Supp. 1028 (E.D.N.Y. 1993), the district court relied on McNary to hold that, because \\*Guantamamo Bay Naval Base . . is under the complete control and jurisdiction of the United States govemument,\" aliens held there must begramntedsomeconsitutional protections.Idat 1040.: \nFor a mumber of reasons, however, we believe that a federal district court would not accept these arguments. First, the best reading of Eisenirager indicates that the Cout was only pemtmghabeasjinsareorwine wereigewitadSihdopeo include GBC.Second,no federal statutes include GBC within the temitonal junsdictionof any federal district court. The fact that the United States can cxercise some jurisdiction\" and “control over the base is not the relevant factor for purposes of the analysis in Eisentrager. Presumably the Umited States similarly exereised considerable \\*jurisdiction” and “control\\* over the Landsberg Prison, which was umder the command of an American Army general at thc time, where the applieants in Eisentrager were held. That, however, was not deemed relevant to the Court's analysis."

        "text": "Third, the McNary and Sale cases cited above are not persuasive authority for extending habeas jurisdiction to GBC. To begin with, the cases did not address habeas jurisdiction at all and thus never squarely confronted the analysis in Eisentrager. Instead, MeNary, for cxample, addressed whether the United States,in interdicting Haitian refugees and detaining them at GBC, had violated intermational-treaties-and-agrcements, stahutes, and-executive.orders.Jn_ fac.We. have not found any case directly.addressing habeas jurisdiction over an alien held at GBC. In addition, both MeNary and Sale have been vacated. McNary was vacated as moot by_the. Supreme Court, see 509 U.S. 918_ (1993),. and Sale was subsequently vacated by Stipulated Ordet, see Cuban American Bar Ass n, 43 F.3d at 1424. More importantly, the analysis in Sale has also been expressly rejected by the Eleventh Circuit. See id at 1425 (The district court here ered in [relying on Sale and] concluding that Guantanamo Bay was a \\*United States territory. We disagree that \"control and jurisdiction' is cquivalent to²sovereigmty.\")”(citationomitted). Finally, to the extent the Second Circuit in McNary relied on the theory that GBC was within the \"special maritime and temitorial jurisdiction\" of the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 7, it is particularly weak authority for habeas jurisdiction here. Section 7 of title 18 defines places or circumstances where certain criminal laws of the United States shall apply to proscnibe conduct. 18 U.S.C. g 7 (1994). The mere fact that-U.S.criminal law applies, however, does not bring a place within the temitorial jurisdiction_of a federal district court.As the Supreme Court explained in Yermibya-Brown, a nation may cxtend its statutes to regulate conduct “on areas under the control, though not within the territorial jurisdiction or sovereignty, of the nation enacting the legislation.\" 335 U.S. at 381. Laws are fequently applied extraterritorially to conduct occuring outside a nation’s teitorial jurisdiction, but the mere aplication of law in such a case does not alter the temitorial jurisdiction of the courts or their power to grant the writ of habeas corpus. Indeed, the venue provision for cases arising under the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States cxpressly ackmowledges this distinction. It sets out the venue for crimes that occur “oot of the jurisdiction of any particular State or distnicL.\" 18 U.S.C. 3238 (1994). \nIn addition, tbe Second Circuit has subsequently repudiated the cwrsory analysis. m McNary, which esscntially assuwmed that 18 U.S.C. 5 7 applied to GBC. Instead, the Second Circuit has held that the statute bas no extralemritorial application. See United States v. Gatlin, 216 F.3d 207,214 (2nd Cir.2000). After holding that $57$ had no temitorial application for tbe case before it, the Gatlin Court noted that \\*the United Stales base-al Guantanamo Bay is technically outside the temitorial boundaries of the United States\" and declined to exprcss a vicw. on \"wbether our dienum in MeNary was comect.: Jd. at-214 n.8.°--McNary's reliance on: 18'"

Detention and trial of al Qaeda and Taliban members is umdertaken pwrsuant to the President's Commander in Chief and foreign affairs powers.Without a clear statement from Congress extending jurisdiction to GBC, a court should defer to the executive branch's activities and decisions prosecuting the war in Afghanistun. \n# \n-You.have_also.asked us_about the_potential Jegal.exposurr_if a_detainee_succsfully convinces a federal district cout to exercise habeas jurisdiction.There is litle doubt that sucha result could interfere with the operation of the system that has been developed to address the detainment and trial of enemy aliens. First, a habeas petition would allow a detainee to challenge the legality of his status and treatment wmder intermational treaties, such as the Geneva Conventions and the Lntermational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. See 28 U.S.C. 5 2241(c)(4). Thus, a court could review, in part, the question wbether and what intemational law Dorms may or may not apply to the conduct of the war in Afghanistan, both by the United States and its enemies. Second, a detainec could challenge the use of military commissions and the, validity of any charges brought as violation of the laws of war under both intermational and domestic law. See 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)3). Third, although the Supreme Court in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942) foreclosed habeas review of the procedures used by military commissions, a petitioner could argue that subsequent developments in the law of habeas corpus require the federal courts to review the constitutionality of military commission procedures today. Fourth, a petitioner might even be able to question the constitutional authority of the President to use force in Afghanistan and the legality of Congress's statutory authorization in place ofa declarationof war. \nFinally, you have asked about the nights that an enemy alien babeas petitioner would cnjoy as a litigant in federal court, assuming that the cowt has found jurisdiction to exist.
