The function table(）provides a quick way to summarize a data vector, to see if anything looks obviously out of place.Executing this function on the clock column, we obtain the following: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllllllllllllllllllllllllll}\n & >table（clock) \\\\\nclock \\\\\n48 & 50 &  & 60 & 64 & 66 & 670 & 75 & 577 &  & 80 & 85 &  &  & 9096 & 99100101110 \\\\\n &  &  & 275291300333350 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 4 & 1 &  &  & 1 & 4 &  &  &  & 1 &  & 1 & 2 &  & 10 & 1 \\\\\n &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & 1 &  &  &  & 2 &  &  &  &  &  &  & 1 &  &  &  &  &  & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 4 & 4 &  &  & 2 & 2 & 1 &  &  & 4 & 1 & 1 &  & 22 &  & 2 &  & 1 &  &  & 1 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe top line shows the unique values that appear in the column.The list of numbers directly below that line is the count of how many times that particular value appeared in the column.For example,48 appeared once,while50appeared three times and 60appeared four times.Wesee areasonablerangeof valueswithminimum（48）and maximum（350）values that are not unexpected. Some of the values occur only once; the most frequent value occurs ten times, which again does not seem unreasonable.In short,we do not see anything obviously amiss with theseresults.We conclude that the problem likely is with a differentdatacolumn. \nExecuting the table(）function on the next column in the data frame threads produces this output: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{l}\ntable(threads) \\\\\nthreads \\\\\n \\\\\n1 \\\\\n78 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"
