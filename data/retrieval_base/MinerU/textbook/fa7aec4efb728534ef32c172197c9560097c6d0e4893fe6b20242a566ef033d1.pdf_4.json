To standardize visual estimates among researchers,we referred to published area charts (Anderson1986),and used $0.1~\\mathrm m^{2}$ PVCframes as a standard area reference. Following data collection, we calculated the relative percent cover $(\\boldsymbol{p}_{i})$ of each species on each plot by dividing the summed total cover of each species by the summed total cover of the plot. \n# \nUsing the relative percent cover calculated for each year, we determined plot diversity using the Shannon index of diversity: \n$$\n1)\\mathrm{H}^{\\prime}=-\\Sigma\\:\\rho_{\\scriptscriptstyle i}\\log\\:\\rho_{\\scriptscriptstyle i}\n$$\nand Simpson's index of diversity: \n$$\n2)\\mathrm{~D=1}{-}\\Sigma{p_{i}^{2}}\n$$\n(McCune and Grace 2002).As recommended by Peet (1974),we used the exponential of $\\mathrm{H}^{\\prime}$ for analysis, as this indicates thefunctionalnumber of species in the sample.Interpretations of theresultsremain the same,with higher values indicating higher diversity.Simpson's index has a range from zero, with a single species present, to one,maximum diversity(Peet1974). Estimates of percent cover havebeen usedsuccessfullyinprevious studies to calculate these diversity indices (Potvin and Vasseur 1997, Tilman et al. 1997), and avoid errors resulting from miscounting clonal species if density had been used. \nTo evaluate community quality, we calculatedthemeancoefficientofconservatism $\\mathbf{\\Psi}^{(\\overline{{\\mathbf{C}}})}$ , and a foristic quality index (FQI) for each plot to distinguish amongtreatmentcombinations containing ubiquitousnativeplants and those containing species more likely to occur in undisturbed native plant communities.These methods rely on coefficients ofconservatism specific to Michigan (MDNR 2001), ranging from zero,representing ubiquitousative species,toten,rreent inghighly conservednative species (Taft et al.1997).FQI was calculated for each plot by multiplying the C for the plot by the square root of the number ofnative species on theplot (Packard and Mutel 1997). Native tree and shrub species are notpart of the targetprairiecommunity andwere excluded from FQI and C analysis. \n\nFor analyses of community composition,we classified species into one of six groups: non-native forbs, knapweed,non-native grasses,native graminoids,native forbs, and tree/ shrub species. The non-native forbs groupdoesnotincludeknapweed. As the dominant invasive species and a focus ofour research,knapweed was classified independently. Following this classification, we calculated the relative percent cover for each grouping by summing therelative percent"
