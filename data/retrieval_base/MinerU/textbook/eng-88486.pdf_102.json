Substitutional diffusion is only possible if the lattice has a number of vacancies, or empty lattice sites, scatered throughout the crystal,so that there are places into which the impurity can move. Moving interstitially requires energy to get over the potential barrier of the regions between the lattice sites. Energy is required to form the vacancies for substitutional diffusion.Thus,for either form of difusion,thediffusioncoefficient $D$ isastrongfunctionoftemperature. \nFigure 4.4.1: Interstitial diffusion \nFigure 4.4.2: Substitutional diffusion \nToaverygood degree of accuracy,one can describe the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficientwith an activation energy $E_{A}$ suchthat: \n$$\nD(T)=D_{o}e^{-{\\frac{E_{a}}{k T}}}\n$$\nThe activation energy $E_{A}$ and coefficient $D_{o}$ are btainedfrom a plotf the natural log of $D$ Vs. T, called an Arrheius plot (Figure 4.4.3). The slope gives $E_{A}$ and the projection to infinite $T$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{1}{T}\\rightarrow0}\\end{array}$ gives $\\ln(D_{o})$ \nFigure 4.4.3:Arrhenius plot of diffusion constant \nThe continuity equation holds for motion of impurities just like it does for anything else,so the divergence of the flux,div $(F)$ must equal the negative of the time rate of change of the concentration of the impurities, or, in one dimension:"
