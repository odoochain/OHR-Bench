        "text": "One very famous example of a non-credible secondary source was a paper, published in a very credible scientific journal, that linked autism to some of the ingredients in childhood vaccines. The result of this seemingly credible study was that many parents stopped vaccinating their children out of fear of autism. The result on society was an increase in childhood diseases, such as measles and whooping cough, that had almost been wiped out in the U.S. and elsewhere. Other scientists tried to replicate the results of the study,but they could not (validating results is also part of academic,especially scientific,inquiry).This failure to replicate theresults called into question thevalidity of the original study.Theoriginal author and thejournal recanted the study,so thisrelationshipbetweenvaccines andautism hasnowbeendebunked. \n# \nTertiary sources are those sources that have alreadybeeninterpretedbytwopeople.These sources arenot nearlyas reliable as primary and secondary sources because it is nearly impossiblefor a reader/listener to determine if the interpretation others have made is logical and accurate/appropriate. Common examples of tertiary sources are magazine articles in which an author uses a number of secondary sources or,lately, newspaper articles that cite other newspaper articles rather than an original source.Blogs are another common tertiary source,and they are rarely credible enough to include as a source for academic writing. (However, some academicresearchers dohave their ownblogs,andif theirworkisgenerally considered credible,so are theirblogs).Tertiary sources are like rumors -you have to take them withâ€œa grain of salt.\"Many times, tertiary sources will also be filled with emotive language to get you to feel a certain way about the topic.This is a clue that your source maynot be credible enough. \n# \nYour topic and purpose determine whether you must use both primary and secondary sources in your paper. Ask yourself which sources aremost likely to provide the information that will answer your research questions.If you are writing a research paper about reality television shows,you will need to use some reality shows as a primary source,but secondary sources,such as a reviewer's critique,are alsoimportant.Ifyou arewriting about thehealth effects of nicotine,you will probably want toread the published results of scientific studies, but secondary sources, such as magazine articles discussing the outcome of a recent study, may alsobehelpful. \nOnce you have thought about what kinds of sources aremost likely to help you answer your research questions, you may begin your search for print and electronic resources.The challenge here is to conduct your search efficiently.Writers use strategies to help them find the sources that are most relevant and reliable while steering clear of sources that will not be useful. \n# \nThese days,there really isn't much difference in how you find your resources, whether they are print or electronic. Either way, you will likely search for them digitally.The only difference is whetheryou read the read or watch the resource online or hold it and read a print version.Keep in mind, however, that some potentially useful sources may be available only in print form. Others may be only available electronically.
