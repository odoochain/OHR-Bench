Similarly, to find $\\operatorname{ch}_{2}(\\Lambda)$ wewrite \n$$\nc_{2}(\\Lambda)=\\frac{\\coth_{1}(\\Lambda)^{2}}{2}-\\operatorname{ch}_{2}(\\Lambda)=\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{288}\n$$\nsince $\\operatorname{ch}_{2}(\\Lambda)=0$ .Ingeneral,it'sclear thatthe Grothendieck-RiemannRoch in this case expresses each of the Chern classes of theHodge bundle as a polynomial (with rational coefficients) in the tautological classes $\\kappa_{i}$ , and that the polynomial may be worked out explicitly in any given case. Note in particular that, while the $\\lambda_{i}$ arepolynomials inthe $\\kappa_{i}$ ,the above examples already show that the converse is not true. \nNext,weconsider how this computation—atleastin the case of the codimension 1 classes in $\\overline{{\\mathcal{M}}}_{g}$ —may be extended over all of the stable compactification $\\overline{{\\mathcal{M}}}_{g}$ .Herewe'll see the discussion of Section D used in practice.First of all,to define our terms,we will denote by $(1)$ the relative dualizing sheaf of $\\overline{{C}}_{g}$ over $\\overline{{\\mathcal{M}}}_{g}$ , and call the direct image $\\pi_{*}(0$ on $\\overline{{\\mathcal{M}}}_{\\mathcal{Q}}$ the Hodge bundle $\\Lambda$ . Note that the problem we were able to gloss over above has now become more serious: the universal curvenowfailstobeuniversaloveracodimension1locus(allthe points $[C]\\in\\Delta_{1}\\subset\\overline{{\\mathcal{M}}}_{g}$ correspond to curves with automorphisms). But now we have an alternative: by Proposition (3.93), in order to derive orprove anyrelation among divisor classes on the moduli space wesimplyhavetoverifythecorrespondingrelationamongtheassociateddivisorclassesonthebase $B$ of anyfamily $x-B$ ofstablecurves withsmooth,one-dimensionalbaseandsmoothgeneralfiber. \nTo do this, let $\\rho:\\mathcal{X}\\xrightarrow{}B$ be any such one-parameter family of stable curves.Wewill use $t$ to denote a local coordinate on thebase $B$ of the family.Wemake onemodification:welet $\\mu:y\\rightarrow x$ be aminimalresolution of the singularities of the total space $x$ , and let $\\nu=\\rho\\circ\\mu:y{\\mathrm{-}}B$ bethecomposition.Thishastheeffect,foreachnode $p$ of a fiber of $x\\rightarrow B$ with local coordinates $x,y,t$ satisfying $x y=t^{k}$ , of replacing the point $p$ by a chain of $k-1$ rational curves. In thisway we arrive at a family $\\nu:y\\mathrm{-}B$ ofsemistablecurves,withsmoothtotalspace and having $k$ nodes lying over each node of a fiber of $x$ with local equation $x y-t^{k}$ . To relate the invariants of the new family $\\nu:y\\mathrm{-}B$ to those of the original,wehave the: \nExERcise (3.io8)1) Show that therelative dualizingsheaf of the new family is trivial on the exceptional divisor of the map $\\mu$ ,andhencethat it's simply the pullback of the relative dualizing sheaf of $\\rho:\\boldsymbol{\\chi}\\mathbin{\\-}\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\boldsymbol{B}$ i.e., \n$$\n\\omega y_{/B}=\\mu^{*}\\omega x_{/B}.\n$$"
