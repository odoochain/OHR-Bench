Notice the restriction that $n\\neq-1$ . This is important: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\int\\frac{1}{x}d x\\neq{}^{\\\"}\\frac{1}{0}x^{0}+C}\\end{array}$ \"; rather, see Rule $\\#14$ 2.We are presenting antidifferentiation as the\"inverse operation\"of differentiation.Here is a useful quote to remember: \"Inverseoperationsdotheoppositethingsintheoppositeorder.\" When taking a derivative using the Power Rule, we first multiply by the power,then second subtract 1 from the power. T find the antiderivative, do the opposite things in the opposite order: first add one to the power,then second divide by the power. ·NotethatRule#14incorporatestheabsolutevalueof $_x$ .The exerciseswillworkthereader throughwhy thisis the case;for now,knowthe absolutevalueismportant andcannot beignored. \n# \nIn Section 2.3 we saw that the derivative of a position function gave a velocity function, and the derivative of a velocity function describes acceleration.We can now go\"the other way:\"the antiderivative of an acceleration function gives a velocity function,etc. While there is just one derivative of a given function, there are infinite antiderivatives. Therefore we cannot ask \"What is the velocity of anobjectwhose accelerationis $-32\\mathrm{ft}/\\mathrm{s}^{2}?^{\\prime\\prime}$ sincethereismorethanoneanswer. \nWe canfind the answerif we providemore informationwith the question,as doneinthefollowing example.Often the addition information comes in the form of an initial value,a value of thefunction that one knowsbeforehand. \n# \nThe acceleration due to gravity of a falling object is $-32~\\mathrm{ft/s^{2}}$ Attime $t=3$ , a falling object had a velocity of $^{-10}$ ft/s.Find the equation of the object's velocity. \n# \nWe want to know a velocity function, $v(t)$ Weknowtwo things: \n1. The acceleration, i.e., $v^{\\prime}(t)=-32$ ,and   \n2. the velocity at a specific time,i.e., $v(3)=-10$ \nUsing the first piece of information, we know that $v(t)$ is an antiderivative of $v^{\\prime}(t)=-32$ . So we begin by finding the indefiniteintegralof $-32$ \n$$\n\\int(-32)d t=-32t+C=v(t).\n$$\nNowwe use thefact that $v(3)=-10$ to find $C$ \n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{v(t)=-32t+C}}\\ {{v(3)=-10}}\\ {{-32(3)+C=-10}}\\ {{C=86}}\\end{array}\n$$\nThus $v(t)=-32t+86$ .We can use this equation to understand the motion of the object: when $t=0$ ,theobjecthad a velocityof $\\$8$ ft/s.Since the velocity is positive,the object was moving upward. \nWhen did theobject beginmoving down?Immediately after $v(t)=0$"
