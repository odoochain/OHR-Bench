Further, his symptoms caused him to experience impairment at home and school. Unlike Michael, Jakeprobably would be diagnosed with ADHD. \n# \nThereasons that some children developADHD are complex, and it is generally recognized that a single cause is insufficient to explainwhy an individual child does or does not have the disorder.Researchershave attempted to identifyriskfactors that predispose a child to develop ADHD.These risk factors range in scope from genetic(e.g., specific gene polymorphisms) to familial (e.g., poor parenting)to cultural (e.g., low socioeconomic status). This section will identify some of the risk factors that are thought to contribute to ADHD. It will conclude by reviewing some of the more controversial ideas about the causes of ADHD, such as poor parenting and children's diets,and review some of the evidence pertaining to these causes. \nStudiesof twinshaveshownthatgeneticsareprmarilyresponsibleforADHD.[mage:donnierayjoneshttps:/goo.gl/dgPvFx, BY 2.0,https://goo.gl/9uSnqN] \nMost experts believe that genetic and neurophysiological factors cause the majority of ADHD cases.Indeed, ADHDis primarily a genetic disorder—twin studiesfind that whether ornot a child develops ADHDis duein largepart $(75\\%)$ togeneticvariations (Faraone et al., 2005).Further, children with a family history of ADHD are more likely to develop ADHD themselves (Faraone & Biederman,1994).Specific genes that have been associated withADHD are linked to neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. In addition, neuroimagining studies have found that children with ADHD show reduced brain volume in some regions of the brain,such as the prefrontal cortex,the corpus callosum,the anterior cingulate cortex,the basal ganglia,and the cerebellum (Seidman,Valera,&Makris,2005).Among their otherfunctions,theseregions of thebrain are mplicated in organization,impulse control, and motor activity, so the reduced volume of these structures in children with ADHD may cause some of their symptoms. \nAlthoughgenetics appear tobea maincause ofADHD,recent studieshave shown thatenvironmentalriskfactorsmaycause a minority of ADHD cases. Many of these environmental risk factors increase the risk for ADHD by disrupting early development and compromising theintegrity of the central nervous system.Environmental influences such as lowbirth weight,malnutrition,and maternal alcohol and nicotine use during pregnancy can increase the likelihood that a child will develop ADHD (Mick, Biederman, Faraone,Sayer, & Kleinman, 2002).Additionally,recent studies have shown that exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead and pesticides,early in a child's life may alsoincreaserisk of developingADHD (Nigg,2006). \n# \nControversial explanationsfor the development ofADHDhaverisenandfalleninpopularity since the1960s.Some of theseideas arise from cultural folklore, others can be traced to “specialists\" trying to market an easy fix for ADHD based on their proposed cause. Some other ideas contain a kernel of truth but have been falsely cast as causing the majority of ADHD cases."
