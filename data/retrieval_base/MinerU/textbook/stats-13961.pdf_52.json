Notice that the distribution of scores hasan outlier.This student has mostly highhomework scoreswith one score of 0.Here are some observationsaboutthehomeworkdata. \n·Five-number summary:low:0 Q1:82 Q2: 84.5Q3: 89 high:100   \n·Medianis84.5andIQRis7   \n·Mean $=81.8$ $\\mathrm{SD}=17.6$ \nThe typical range of scores based on the first and third quartiles is 82 to 89. \n[he typical range of scores based on Mean $\\pm$ SD is 64.2 to 99.4 (Here's how we calculated this: $81.8-17.6=64.2\\$ $81.8+17.6=$ 9.4.) \nWhichisthebettersummaryof thestudent'sperformanceonhomework? \nThe typical range based on the mean and standard deviation is not a good summary of this student's homework scores.Here we see that the outlier decreases themean so that the mean is toolow tobe representative of this student's typical performance.We also see that the outlierincreases the standard deviation,which gives theimpressionof a widevariabilityinscores.Thismakes sense because the standard deviationmeasures the average deviation of thedata from the mean.So a point that has a large deviationfrom themeanwill increase the average of thedeviations.In this example,a singlescoreisresponsibleforgiving theimpression that the student'stypical homeworkscores arelower thantheyreally are. \nThe typical range based on the first and third quartiles gives a better summary of this student's performance on homework becaus theoutlierdoesnot affectthequartilemarks. \n# \n# \nIn this example,we look at how skewness in a data set affects the standard deviation.The following histogram shows the personal income of a large sample of individuals drawn from U.S. census data in the year 2000. Notice that it is strongly skewed to the right. This type of skewnessis often present in datasets of variables such as income."
