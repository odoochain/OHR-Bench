That's why (10.5) is the pull-back on $G/P$ of a $G$ -linearized bundle on $G/G$ , and is hence trivial as a line bundle. The corresponding $G$ -linearized bundle on $G/G$ is not trivial as a $G$ -bundle (since det : $G\\to\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$ does not equal the trivial homomorphism), and (10.5) is also not trivial as a $G$ -bundleon $G/P$ \nNow considerinmore detail the case when $m=n-1$ and ${\\cal P}\\:=\\:\\:{\\cal B}$ is the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular matrices in $G L\\left(V\\right)$ for $V=\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ .Here the correspondence from Proposition 10.2 has the following explicit form. Order the basis of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ as $e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}$ . Then the group of characters ${\\mathrm{Hom}}(B,\\mathbb{C}^{\\times})$ is identified with $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ . The $G$ -linearized line bundle corresponding to $(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{n})\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is simply \n$$\nS_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes(S_{2}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes(\\tilde{\\mathbb{C}}^{n}/S_{n-1})^{\\lambda_{n}}.\n$$\nVerifying this is a non-difficult but essential computation. The simplest case is $n=$ 2: here one needs to check that the $B$ -character in the fber of the bundle $S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes$ $(\\tilde{\\mathbb{C}}^{2}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}}$ at the point $B\\in G/B$ is precisely the character $(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2})\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ We hope that the reader will verify this explicitly. \nFor a general connected reductive group $G$ and a Borel subgroup $B\\subset G$ ,we denote by $O(\\lambda)$ the $G$ -linearized line bundle on $G/B$ corresponding to acharacter $\\lambda:B\\to\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$ ,i.e., such that $B$ acts via $\\lambda$ in the fiber of $O(\\lambda)$ at the point $B\\in G/B$ If wechoose $G$ to be $S L(V)$ ,then every line bundle on $G/B$ admits a unique $G$ linearization and the bijection of Proposition 10.2 induces an equality Pic $G/B=$ ${\\mathrm{Hom}}(B,\\mathbb{C}^{\\times})$ ,where $B$ is now a Borel subgroup of $S L(V)$ \nThe isomorphisms (10.3) enable us to compute explicitly the cohomology of any $G L(2)$ -linearizedlinebundle on $G L(2)/P=\\mathbb{P}(V)$ for $V=\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ .Indeed,notice that inthiscase \n$$\nO(\\lambda)=S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes(\\tilde{V}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}}=S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}}\\otimes(\\Lambda^{2}(\\tilde{V}))^{\\otimes\\lambda_{2}},\n$$\nwhere $(\\Lambda^{2}(\\tilde{V}))^{\\otimes\\lambda_{2}}$ is a trivial bundle on $\\mathbb{P}(V)$ with a nontrivial $G$ -linearization. Hence (10.3) implies for $\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1}\\geq0$ \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{H^{0}(\\mathbb{P}(V),S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes(\\tilde{V}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}})=S^{\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1}}(V^{*})\\otimes(\\Lambda^{2}(V))^{\\otimes\\lambda_{2}},}\\ &{H^{1}(\\mathbb{P}(V),S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes(\\tilde{V}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}})=0;}\\end{array}\n$$\nfor $\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1}\\leq-2$ \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{H^{0}(\\mathbb{P}(V),S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes(\\tilde{V}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}})=0,}\\ &{H^{1}(\\mathbb{P}(V),S_{1}^{\\lambda_{1}}\\otimes(\\tilde{V}/S_{1})^{\\lambda_{2}})=S^{\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}-2}(V)\\otimes(\\Lambda^{2}(V))^{\\otimes\\lambda_{2}+1};}\\end{array}\n$$"
