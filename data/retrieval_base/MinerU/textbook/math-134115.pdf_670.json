In fewer than ten years, the rabbit population numbered in themillions. \nFigure3.7.1:Wild rabbits inAustralia.The rabbit population grew so quicklyinAustralia that the event became known as the “\"rabbit plague.\"(credit:Richard Taylor,Flickr) \nUncontrolledpopulation growth, as in the wild rabbits in Australia,canbe modeled with exponential functions.Equations resulting from those exponential functions can be solved to analyze and make predictions about exponential growth. In this section, we will learntechniquesforsolvingexponential functions. \n# \nThefirst technique involvestwofunctionswith likebases.Recall that the one-to-one property of exponentialfunctions tllsus that foranyreal numbers $^{b}$ $S$ , and $T$ where $b>0$ ， $b\\neq1$ ， $\\boldsymbol{b}^{S}=\\boldsymbol{b}^{T}$ if and onlyif $S=T$ \nIn other words,when an exponential equation has the same base on each side, the exponents must be equal.This also applies when the exponents are algebraic expressions.Therefore, we can solve many exponential equations by using the rules of exponents to rewrite each side as a power with the same base.Then,we use the fact that exponential functions are one-to-one to set the exponentsequal toone another,andsolvefortheunknown. \nFor xample cosde the eguaion 3a- $_x$   \nside so that both sides have the common base,3.Then we apply the one-to-one property of exponents by seting the exponents   \nequal tooneanother and solvingfor $_x$ \n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{3^{4x-7}={\\displaystyle\\frac{3^{2x}}{3}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\ {{3^{4x-7}={\\displaystyle\\frac{3^{2x}}{3^{1}}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\quad3^{4x-7}=3^{2x-1}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle4x-7=2x-1}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\quad2x=6}}\\ {{\\displaystyle x=3}}\\end{array}\n$$\nRewrite3as $3^{1}$ \nUse the division property of exponents Apply the one-to-one property ofexponents Subtract ${2}\\mathbf{x}$ and add7tobothsides Divide by 3"
