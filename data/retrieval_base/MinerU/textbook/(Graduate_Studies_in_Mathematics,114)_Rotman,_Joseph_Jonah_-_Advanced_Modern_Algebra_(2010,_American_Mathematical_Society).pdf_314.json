The Correspondence Theoren for Groups, Theorem 1.82, now applies to the natural map $\\pi\\colon R\\to R/I$ ,and it gives an inclusion-preserving bijection \nÎ¦ : {all subgroups of $R$ containing $I\\}\\rightarrow\\{\\mathrm{all}$ subgroups of R/I}, where $\\Phi(J)=\\pi(J)=J/I$ \nIf $J$ is an ideal, then $\\Phi(J)$ is also an ideal, for if $r\\in R$ and $a\\in J$ ,then $r a\\in J$ and \n$$\n(r+I)(a+I)=r a+I\\in J/I.\n$$\nLet $\\varphi$ be the restriction of $\\Phi$ to the set of intermediate ideals; $4$ is an injection because $\\Phi$ is an injection.To see that $4$ is surjective,let $J^{*}$ be an ideal in $R/I$ Now $\\pi^{-1}(J^{*})$ is an intermediate ideal in $R$ ,for it contains $I=\\pi^{-1}((0))$ ,and $\\varphi(\\pi^{-1}(J^{*}))=\\pi(\\pi^{-1}(J^{*}))=J^{*}$ \nFigure 5.1.Correspondence Theorem. \nUsually, the Correspondence Theorem for Rings is invoked, tacitly, by saying that every ideal in the quotient ring $R/I$ hasthe form $J/I$ for some unique ideal $J$ with $I\\subseteq J\\subseteq R$ \nExample5.2.Let $I=(m)$ beanonzeroideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$ If $J$ isanidealin $\\mathbb{Z}$ containing $I$ then ${\\boldsymbol{J}}=({\\boldsymbol{a}})$ for some $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ (because $\\mathbb{Z}$ isaPID).Since $(m)\\subseteq(a)$ if and only if $a\\mid m$ ,the Correspondence Theoren for Rings shows that every ideal in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/I=\\mathbb{I}_{m}$ has the form $J/I=([a])$ forsomedivisor $a$ of $m$ \nDefinition. An ideal $I$ ina commutative ring $R$ is called a prime ideal if it is a proper ideal, that is, $I\\neq R,$ and $a b\\in I$ implies that $a\\in I$ $b\\in I$ \n# \n(i)The ideal (O) is a prime ideal in a ring $R$ if and only if $R$ isadomain."
