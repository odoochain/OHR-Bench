Under certain circumstances, electrons areemitted from theiluminated surface.Wecanvary theintensityof thelight and itsfrequency(itscolour). \n\n# \nThese expectations are based on the belief that light is an electromagnetic wave; if we increase the intensity of the light this is equivalent to increasing the amplitudeof theoscillating electricfield of which the light wave is composed.Since the energy of the light beam is spread uniformly over the beam, it is transferred continuously to the electrons, which require a certain minimum of energy to escape the attractive forces of the metal. In thefollowing,\"The maximum energy of the electrons\"means\"The energy of themostenergeticelectrons\". \n·c.There may be a time delay between the switching on of the light and the appearance of the first electrons; the lower the light intensity, thelongerwill be this timedelay. \n# \n·c.Nomatter howweak thelight,as longas its frequencyis above the threshold frequency,the emission of electrons starts IMMEDIATELYthelight is switched on. \n(In case you were wondering;an increase in the light intensity increases the number of electrons emitted per second,while leavingtheenergyofeachelectronunchanged). \n# \n·c.The interaction between a photon and an electron in the metal is a unique, elemental act, in which the photon can give ul some,orall ofitsenergytotheelectron,which thenmighthaveenoughenergy toescapefrom themetal. \nWhy doesthisexplain the observations? \nThe electron is kept in the metal by the electric forces, and can only escape if a certain minimum amount of energy is given to it.If the photon energy (i.e. frequency) is too low to overcome this attractive force between the electrons and the metal, the electron can't escape.Thus the frequency of thephoton must be above a certain value(which depends on theparticular metal).Once we are above thisthreshold,thephoton eitherhits anelectronorit doesn't.If it does,andif enoughenergyis transferred tothe theelectron from the photon, the electron will have enough energy to escape IMMEDIATELY, with no time delay.Also, if we increase the energy of the photon by increasingitsfrequency,the electronswhich interact with these electrons can come off with increased energy). \nEinstein's conjecture that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency can be written $\\mathbf{E_{photon}}=\\mathbf{h}\\mathbf{f}$ ;here $\\mathbf{h}$ is Planck's constant. \n# \nThe great success of Einstein's theory for the photoelectric effect stimulate de Broglie to postulate in his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Paris,that particles might exhibit wave-like properties. Starting from Einstein's relation, $\\mathbf{E_{photon}}=\\mathbf{h}$ fand usingthe relation given by Maxwell's equations for the momentum of a light wave, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{light}}=\\mathbf{pc}$ (where $\\mathbf{p}$ is the momentum of the light, and c"
