Two Milnor manifolds $M_{k,-k}$ and $M_{r,-r}$ are diffeomorphic if and only if $|k|=|r|$ \n# \n(1) Let $E$ be a complex vector bundle over $S^{4k}$ . Give a formula for the Pontrjagin class $p_{k}(E)$ in terms of $c_{2k}(E)$   \n(2) Let $E$ bea $2k$ -dimensionaloriented vector bundle.Prove that $p_{k}(E)=e(E)\\smile e(E)$   \n(3) Let $E$ be a not necessarily oriented $2k$ -dimensional vector bundle. Prove that the class represented by $p_{k}(E)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ -cohomology is equal to $w_{2k}(E)\\smile w_{2k}(E)$   \n(4) Prove that $\\langle p_{k}(E),[S^{4k}]\\rangle$ is even for all vector bundles $E$ over $S^{4k}$ You can use (or better prove it as an application of Sard's theorem) that an $r$ -dimensional vector bundle over $S^{n}$ with $r>n$ is isomorphic to $F\\oplus(S^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{r-n})$ for some $n$ -dimensional vector bundle $F$"
