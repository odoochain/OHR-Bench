The effectiveness of supplemental testosterone is mixed,andlong term testosteronereplacement therapyfor men canincrease therisk of prostate cancer,blood clots,heart attack and stroke (WebMD, 2016).Most men with low testosterone do not have related problems (Berkeley Wellness,2011). \n# \nSexuality is an important part of people's lives at any age, and many older adults are very interested in staying sexually active (Dimah &Dimah, 2004).According to the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB)(Center for Sexual Health Promotion,2010), $74\\%$ ofmales and $70\\%$ of females aged 40-49 engaged in vaginal intercourse during the previous year, while $58\\%$ ofmalesand $51\\%$ offemalesaged50-59didso. \nFigure 8.15. Source. \nDespite these percentages indicating that middle adults are sexually active, age-related physical changes can affect sexual functioning.For women, decreased sexual desire and pain during vaginal intercourse because of menopausal changes have been identified (Schick et al., 2010).A woman may also notice less vaginal lubrication during arousal which can affect overall pleasure (Carroll, 2016). Men may require more direct stimulation for an erection and the erection may be delayed or less firm (Carroll, 2016).As previously discussed men may experience erectile dysfunction or experience a medical conditions (such as diabetes or heart disease) that impact sexual functioning. Couples can continue to enjoy physical intimacy and may engage in more foreplay, oral sex,and other forms of sexual expression ratherthanfocusing asmuch on sexual intercourse. \nRisk of pregnancy continues until a woman has been without menstruation for at least 12 months, however, and couples should continue to use contraception.People continue to be at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, such as genital herpes, chlamydia,andgenital warts.In 2014, $16.7\\%$ of the country's new HIV diagnoses (7,391 of 44,071) were amongpeople 50 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2014e). This was an increase from $15.4\\%$ in2005.Practicing safe sexisimportant at any age,but unfortunately adults over theage of 40 have thelowest rates of condom use (CenterforSexual Health Promotion, 2010). This low rate of condom use suggests the need to enhance education efforts for older individuals regarding STI risks and prevention.Hopefully,when partners understand how aging affects sexual expression, they will be less likely to misinterpret these changes as alack of sexual interest or displeasure in the partner and more able to continue to have satisfyingandsafesexualrelationships."
