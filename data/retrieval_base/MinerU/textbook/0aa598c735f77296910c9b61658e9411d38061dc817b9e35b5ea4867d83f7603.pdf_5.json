The BAsC-2is a standardized,norm-referencedbehavior rating scale for assessing levels of problem behavior in school-aged students.TheBASC-2 was selectedbecause of its recent revision, its psychometric properties, and its updated, representative normative group. The measure alsocontainsfourvalidityindicestocontrolforbiased responding. The form used in this study was theBASC-2 TeacherReport Scale-ChildForm,designed toratethe behavior of students aged 6 to 11 years. Composite scales for theBASC-2 arereported as $T$ scores,withameanof 50andastandarddeviationof10.Tomeasurelevelof problembehavior,theauthors usedtheBehavioral Symptoms Index (BSI),a composite scale made up of the following subscales: hyperactivity, aggression, depression, attention problems, atypicality, and withdrawal. The BASC-2 test manual reports the following technical adequacy means for this composite scale: alpha reliability, .97; test-retest reliability, .94; and interrater reliability, .64. \nProsocial behaviorratings.Tomeasurelevelof prosocialbehavior,theauthorsusedtheBASC-2Teacher ReportScale-Child FormAdaptiveScale,a composite scale made up of the following subscales: adaptability, social skills,leadership,study skills, and functional communication.

SchoolstaffissueODRstostudentsforseriousbehavioral violations,including fighting, vandalism,harassment, or noncompliance. ODRs have been shown to possess sufficient construct validity as abehavioralmeasure (Irvin, Tobin, Sprague, Sugai,& Vincent, 2004) and adequate concurrent validity with standardized behavior rating scales (McIntosh, Campbell, Carter, & Zumbo, 2008; B.Walker, Cheney, Stage,& Blum, 2005),and ODRs have beenmoderatelycorrelatedwithotherindirectmeasuresof problem behavior, such as student self-report of delinquent behavior(Gottfredson& Gottfredson,1999).In addition, the number and type of ODRs received significantly predict a range of future outcomes,including violent events in school and dropout (Tobin & Sugai, 1999). Predictive validityfrom oneyear to the nextfor middle and high schoolstudentshasbeendocumentedat.54(Gottfredson & Gottfredson,1999),within the reported range of some standardized behavior rating scales. \n\nWhen incidents ofproblembehavior occur in the participating district,school personnel complete ODR forms,which are entered into theSchool-WideInformation System (SWIS; May et al., 2002), a Web-based ODR data system, to tally total ODRs per year.To increase the reliability of ODR data, the district conducts regular trainings ondiscriminatingbetweenbehaviorsthatdoanddonot warrantareferral,basedondefinitionsusedintheSWIs. \n# \nThe Check-In/Check-Out intervention was implemented as described in the manual (Crone et al., 2003), with the school'stier one expectationsused asthestudentbehaviors to be rated (e.g., Safe, Respectful, Responsible) and no modification orindividualization of goals orincentives. Before program implementation, the authors provided two 2-hour training sessionsfor school personnel and then provided monthly follow-up training sessions that stressed the criticalfeaturesoftheinterventionandmechanismsof behavior improvement. The authors advised school administrators to identify school personnel with time at the start and finishofeachday toserveasCheck-In/Check-Out coordinators and mentors.Infour of theschools,theschool counselor served as theprogram coordinator andmentor for the participants.In one school, the special education teacher was the coordinator/mentor, and in thefinal school, an educational aidewasthecoordinator/mentor. \nStudents were referred to participate in the CheckIn/Check-Out intervention by their classroom teachers through their usual school's request for assistance and behavior assistance team process. Prior to beginning the intervention, each student received a brief training session conducted by school personnel that (a) taught the daily routines of the Check-In/Check-Out program, (b) provided  examples and nonexamples of appropriate behavior in school, and (c) provided the student opportunities to practice the daily routines of the program. After training, the student began the program. \nMeasurement.Uponreferralforbehaviorsupportand parentconsent,theschoolnotified theresearchersand an"
