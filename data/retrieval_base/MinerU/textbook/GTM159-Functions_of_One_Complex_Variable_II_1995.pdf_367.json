Also note that $I_{E}^{u}$ may fail to be usc and thus may not be subharmonic.

That the function $\\hat{I}_{E}^{u}$ accomplishes this willbe seen shortly.We are avoiding the word“sweep”in this context as it was used in $\\S2$ in a different way. \nHerearesomeofthepropertiesoftheincreasedfunctionand therefinement.Let $\\Phi_{E}^{u}$ be the set of negative subharmonic functionsused to define $I_{E}^{u}$ \n12.1 Proposition.If $G$ isa hyperbolic open set, $E$ and $F$ are subsetsof $G$ anduand $v$ are negative subharmonicfunctions on $G$ ,then: \n(a) $\\hat{I}_{E}^{u}$ is subharmonic on $G$ (b) $u\\leq I_{E}^{u}\\leq\\hat{I}_{E}^{u}\\leq0$ on $G$"
