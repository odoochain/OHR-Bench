North Carolina was home to a small and scattered population of farmers.The lack of good 1harborshindered growth,and the colonyhad only 3,000 people by 1700. Eventually, the farmers began growing tobacco for sale.They also used native pine to make and export shipbuilding supplies. \nSouth Carolina The proprietors of Carolina were alwaysfarmoreinterested in the southernhalf of their holdings, where they hoped to cultivate sugarcane.In1670 three ships brought settlers from England to South Carolina.They named their first settlement, Charles Town, after the king. \nThe first years of the new colony were difficult. Sugarcane, as it turned out, did not grow well. The first product exported in large quantity was deerskin, popularforEnglish leather.The colony alsobegan to captureandenslaveNativeAmericans,whowere shipped toplantations in theCaribbean. \nThe Georgia Experiment In the 1720s, General JamesOglethorpe,awealthymemberofParliament, began investigating English prisons.He was appalled to find so many debtorsâ€”people who could not pay their debts-behind bars. Oglethorpe askedKingGeorgeIIforacolonysouthofSouth Carolina where thepoor could startover. \n\nTheEnglishgovernmentsawseveraladvantages to a new southern colony. It would help England's poor andprovidea strategicbuffer tokeepSpain from expanding north.King George granted Oglethorpe and hisfriendspermission tosettle between theSavannahandAltamahaRivers.The new colony was named Georgia, in honor of the king, and thefirstsettlersarrivedin1733. \nOglethorpe and his fellow trustees banned slavery, rum,and brandy in Georgia, and they limited the size of landgrants.Still,the colony attractedsettlers from all over Europe, including Scotch-Irish, Welsh, Germans,Swiss,and Italians.Increasingly the settlersobjected tothecolony'sstrict rules.In the $1740s,$ the trustees lifted the restrictions on brandy, rum, and slavery, and in 1750, they granted the settlers their own elected assembly.The next year, the trusteesgavecontrolbacktotheking,andGeorgia became a royal colony. \nBy1775 roughly2.5millionpeoplelivedin England's American colonies. Despite the stumbling startinJamestown,theEnglishhad succeeded in building a large and prosperous society on the east coastofNorthAmerica. \nEngland's success,however,would prove its undoing. By permitting new patterns of land ownership and new types of worship and government in its colonies, the English government had planted the seedsofrebellion. \n# \nSummarizing In what ways was \nEngland permissve with its American colonies? \n# \nStudyCentralTo review thissection,go to tarvol2.glencoe.com and clickonStudy Central\" \n# \n# \n# \n1.
