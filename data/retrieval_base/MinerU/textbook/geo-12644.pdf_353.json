        "text": "Neptune's composition is that of a gas giant: (1) upper atmosphere, (2) atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium and methane gas, (3) mantle of water, ammonia and methane ice, (4) core of rock and ice. \n# \nNeptune'sbluecolorismostlybecauseof frozenmethane $\\mathrm{(CH_{4})}$ .WhenVoyager2visitedNeptunein1986,therewasalargedarkblue spot that scientists named the Great Dark Spot, south of the equator. When the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994,the Great Dark Spot had disappeared but another dark spot had appeared north of the equator. Astronomers think that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on Neptune. \nThe changing appearance of Neptune is caused by its turbulent atmosphere.The winds onNeptune are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system,reaching speeds of $1{,}100~\\mathrm{km/h}$ $(700~\\mathrm{{mi}/h)}$ ,close to the speed of sound.This extreme weather surprised astronomers,since theplanetreceiveslittle energyfromtheSuntopowerweathersystems.Neptuneis also one of the coldest places in the solar system.Temperatures at the top of the clouds are about $-218^{\\mathrm{o}}\\mathrm{C}$ $(-360^{\\mathrm{o}}\\mathrm{F})$ \n# \nNeptune hasfaint rings of ice and dust that may change or disappear in fairly shortime frames. \nNeptune has 13 known moons.Triton, shown in Figure below,is the only one of them that has enough mass to be spherical in shape.Triton orbits in the direction opposite to the orbit of Neptune. Scientists think Triton did not form around Neptune, but insteadwascaptured byNeptune'sgravity as it passedby. \n\nThis image Triton,Neptune's largest moon,was takenbyVoyager 2 in 1989. \nFly by Neptune's moon Triton by watching this video: http://www.space.com/common/media/video/player.php? videoRef=mm32_SunDeath#playerTop \n# \n·The four outer planets are all gas giants made primarily of hydrogen and helium.They have thick gaseous outer layers and liquid interiors.   \n·The outer planets have numerous moons, as well as planetary rings.   \n·Jupiter,byfarthelargest planet in the solar system,has bands of different colored clouds,andalong-lastingstorm called the GreatRedSpot.   \n·Jupiter has more than 60 moons including the four largest, the Galilean moons.   \n·Europahas an ocean of liquidwaterunder a layer of icewhere life may have formed.   \n· Saturn is smaller than Jupiter but has a large system of beautiful rings.   \n·Titan's atmosphere is similar to early Earth's and themoon could harbor primitive life.   \n·UranusandNeptunewerediscoveredrelativelyrecently sincetheyaresofaraway.   \n·Uranus is tilted on its side,probably because of a past collision with a large object.   \n·Neptune is very cold and has strongwinds.Its dark spots are storms inNeptune's atmosphere. \n# \n1.

Why are the outer planets called gas giants?   \n3.How do theGreatRedSpot and GreatDarkSpot differ?   \n4.Name the Galilean moons, and explain why they have that name.   \n5.Why might Europa be a likely place to find extraterrestrial life?"
