(59.12), by the way,is given by \n$$\nP(q)=\\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\pi}^{\\ddag}\\delta}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}(q{-}q^{0})^{2}\\right\\}.\n$$\n# \nThe two uncertainties (4q and Ap) obtained in the last subsection seem to show a reciprocal relation. Namely, according to Eqs. (59.14) and (59.17),respectively, \n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\cal A}q=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\delta}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\cal A}\\phi=\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\delta\\sqrt{2}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$\nThat is, $\\varDelta q$ is proportional to $\\delta$ while $\\varDelta\\phi$ is to $1/\\delta$ Therefore, an effort to reduce $\\varDelta q$ inevitably causes an increase in $A\\phi$ and vice versa. \nFrom Eq. (59.20) we find that \n$$\n\\varDelta\\phi\\cdot\\varDelta q=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{h}{2\\pi}.\n$$\nIt says, for instance, that p approaches infinity if Aq tends to O and $\\varDelta q$ approaches infinity it $\\varDelta\\phi$ tends to O.In other words, in a state in which the coordinate has a definite value, the value of momentum is completely indefinite and in a state in which the momentum has a definite value, the value of coordinate is completely indefinite. \nThe relation (59.21) has been derived from the consideration of a specific wave packet of the form of Eq. (59.12). The question is then, what happens if we take a state other than that chosen here. We give the answer first. For a general $\\psi$ the relation given in Eq. (59.21) does not necessarily hold, but the product $\\varDelta p\\varDelta q$ never becomes smaller than the value given by Eq.(59.21). We have namely"
