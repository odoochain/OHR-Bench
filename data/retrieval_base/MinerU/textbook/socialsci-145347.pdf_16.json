At birth, people are ascribed status in alignment to their physical and mental features，race,andgender.Insomesocieties,people mayearn orachievestatusfromtheirtalents,efforts,oraccomplishments (Griffiths et al., 2015). Obtaining higher education or being an artistic prodigy often corresponds to high status.For example,a collegedegreeawardedfrom an“IvyLeague”university socialweighs higherstatusthana degreefrom a public statecollege.Just as talented artists,musicians, and athletes receive honors,privileges, and celebrity status. \nIn addition, the social, political hierarchy of a society or region designates social status. Consider the social labels within class, race,ethnicity，gender,education,profession,age,and family.Labels definingaperson’scharacteristicsserve astheirosition within the larger group.People in a majority or dominant grouphave higher status(e.g.,rich,White,male,physician,etc.)than those of the minority or subordinate group (e.g,poor, Black,female, housekeeper, etc.). Overall, the location of a person on the social strata influences theirsocialpower andparticipation(Griswold,2013).Individualswith inferior powerhavelimitations to social and physical resources including lack of authority,influence over others, formidable networks, capital, and money. \nMinority groups are defined as people whoreceive unequal treatment and discrimination based on social categories such as age, gender,sexuality,race and ethnicity,religiousbeliefs,or socio-economic class.Minority groups arenotecessarilynumerical minorities (Griffith et al., 2015).For example, a large group of people may be a minority group because they lack social power. The physical and cultural traits of minority groups “are held in low esteem by the dominant or majority group which treats them unfairly”(Henslin, 2011, p. 217). The dominant group has higher power and status in society and receives greater privileges.As a result, the dominant group uses its position to discriminate against those that are different.The dominant group in the United States is represented byWhite,middle-class,Protestant people of northern European descent Doane,2005).Minority groups can garner power by expanding political boundaries or through expanded migration though both efforts do not occur with ease and require societal support from both minority and dominant group members.The loss of power among dominant groups threatens not only their authority over other groups but also the privileges and way of life establishedbythis majority. \n\nPeople sometimes engage in status shifting to garner acceptance or avoid attention. DuBois (1903) described the act of people looking through the eyes of others to measure social place orposition as double consciousness.Hisresearch explored the history and cultural experiences of theAmerican slavery and the plight of Black folk in translating thinking and behavior between racial contexts. DuBois’research helped social scientists understand how and why people display one identity in certain settings and another in different ones.Peoplemustnegotiateasocial situation todecidehowtoproject theirsocial identity and assignalabel"
