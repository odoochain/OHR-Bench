We do this by listing first all the elements $\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\imath\\jmath}$ in which $i+j=2$ (there is only one such pair, $(1,1)$ ), then all the elements inwhich $i+j=3$ (there are only two such pairs, $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ ),and so on; except that we do not list any element that we have already listed.So, assuming that these elements are distinct, our list starts $a_{11}$ ， $a_{12}$ $\\alpha_{21}$ $a_{13}$ ， $a_{22}$ ， $a_{31}$ $a_{14},\\dotsc.$ (If any of these terms duplicates a previous term, then it is simply omitted.) The result of this process will be either an infinite sequence or a finite sequence containing all the elements of theunion of thesets $A_{\\tau}$ .Thus that union is countable. \n29. There are only a finite number of bit strings of each finite length, so we can list all the bit strings by listing first thoseoflength $0$ , then those of length 1, etc. The listing might be $\\lambda,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,\\ldots$ (Recall that $\\lambda$ denotes the empty string.) Actually this is a special case of Exercise 27: the set of all bit strings is the union of a countable number of countable (actually finite) sets,namely the sets of bit strings of length $_n$ for $n=0,1,2,\\ldots$ \n31.Alittleexperimentationwith thisfunction shows thepattern: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\nf(1,1)=1 & f（2,1)=3 & f(3,1)=6 & \\multirow{3}{*}{f（4,1)=10 f(4,2)=14} & \\multirow{3}{*}{f(5,1)=15 f（5,2)=20 f(5,3)=26} & \\multirow{3}{*}{f(6,1)=21 f(6,2)=27} \\\\\nf（1,2)=2 & f（2,2)=5 & f(3,2)=9 \\\\\nf(1,3)=4 & f（2,3)=8 & f(3,3)=13 \\\\\nf(1,4)=7 & f(2,4)=12 & f(3,4)=18 & f(4,3)=19 f（4,4)=25 \\\\\nf(1,5)=11 & f(2,5)=17 & f(3,5)=24 \\\\\nf(1,6)=16 & f(2,6)=23 \\\\\nf（1,7)=22 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nWeseebylooking atthe diagonals of this table thatthefunction takeson successivevalues as $m+n$ increases. \nWhen $m+n=2$ $f(m,n)=1$ .When $m+n=3$ ， $f(m,n)$ takes on thevalues2and3.When $m+n=4$ ， $f(m,n)$ takes on the values 4, $5$ ,and 6.And so on.It is clear from the formula that therange of values the function takes on for a fixed value of $m+n$ say $m+n=x$ is $\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}+1$ through $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}+(x-1)}\\end{array}$ since $_{m}$ can assume thevalues $1,2,3,\\ldots,(x-1)$ under these conditions,and thefirst termin theformulais a fixed positive integer when $m+n$ is fixed. To show that this function is one-to-one and onto,we merely needtoshowthattherangeofvaluesfor $x+1$ picksuppreciselywheretherangeofvaluesfor $x$ left off, i.e., that $f(x-1,1)+1=f(1,x)$ .We compute: \n$$\nf(x-1,1)+1={\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+(x-1)+1={\\frac{x^{2}-x+2}{2}}={\\frac{(x-1)x}{2}}+1=f(1,x)\n$$\n33.It suffices to find one-to-one functions $f:(0,1)\\to[0,1]$ and $g:[0,1]\\to(0,1)$ .Wecanobviouslyusethe function $f(x)=x$ in the first case. For the second, we can just compress $[0,1]$ into, say, $\\left[{\\frac{1}{3}},{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right]$ ; the increasing linear function $g(x)=(x+1)/3$ will do that.It then follows from the Schroder-Bernstein theorem that $|(0,1)|=|[0,1]|$ ： \n35.We can follow the hint or argue as follows,whichreally amounts to the same thing.(See the answer keyfor a proof using bit strings.）Suppose there were such a one-to-one correspondence $f$ from ${\\bf Z}^{+}$ to thepower setof ${\\bf z+}$ (the set of all subsets of ${\\bf z+}$ ).Thus, for each $x\\in\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ $f(x)$ is a subset of ${\\bf z+}$ .Wewill derive a contradiction by showing that $f$ is not onto; we do this by finding an element not in its range. To this end, let $A=\\{x\\mid x\\not\\in f(x)\\}$ .We claim that $A$ is not in the range of $f$ .If it were,then $A=f(x_{0})$ for some $x_{0}\\in\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ .Let us look at whether $x_{0}\\in A$ ornot.Ontheonehand,if $x_{0}\\in A$ ，thenbythedefinitionof $A$ ， itmust be true that $x_{0}\\notin f(x_{0})$ ，which means that $x_{0}\\notin A$ ；thatisa contradiction.On the otherhand,if if $x_{0}\\notin A$ ，then by the definition of $A$ ,it must betrue that $x_{0}\\in f(x_{0})$ ,，which means that $x_{0}\\in A$ ,again a contradiction.Therefore no such one-to-one correspondence exists."
