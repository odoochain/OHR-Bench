According to Merriam Webster, peer pressure is $^{11}\\alpha$ feeling that one must do the same things as other people of one's age and social group in order to be liked or respected by them.\" When this pressure comes directly or indirectly from their peers, members of social groups with similar interests, experiences, or social statuses, it is called peer pressure. Peer pressure can affect individuals of all ethnicities, genders and ages. \n\nPeers naturally play a larger part in peoples’ life as they become more independent. They might spend more time with their peers than with their parents and siblings since school and other activities take them away from home. They are even most likely form deep friendships with some of their classmates, and they may feel as if they’re part of an extended family with them. \n# \n\nTherefore, individuals may be urged to adjust their views, values, or behaviours to those of the individuals from this extended family by modifying their attitudes, values, or actions to match the others. For the individual, this can have either a positive or a negative effect or both. \nPeer pressure can be seen at all ages and social environments but it peeks between adolescents. Adolescence is the period when a person is most vulnerable to peer pressure, as peers have more significant influence on their behaviour. As person grows their wish to be liked and to fit in grows within them. This makes them more susceptible to peer pressure as their peers takes their parents place in being the biggest influence in their life. \n\nPeer pressure is frequently related with episodes of adolescent risk taking as these activities such as smoking, drinking, prevention etc. frequently occur in the company of peers. Peer pressure, on the other hand, isn't just about teens encouraging one another to take risks or engage in risky behaviour. Peer pressure has a lot of positive aspects, and it may be a beneficial factor in the lives of your teenager and their friends. Peers who are dedicated to succeeding in school or sports, for example, can influence others to be more goal-oriented. \n\n# \n\n# \n?
