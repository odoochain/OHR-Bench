To see this without much calculating, first remark that \n$$\nN_{p,q}(f)=N_{0}\\left(M^{p}D^{q}f\\right)=\\|M^{p}D^{q}f\\|_{\\mathbb{R}}\n$$\nandthen $N_{p,q}(\\tilde{f})=N_{0}\\left(M^{p}D^{q}F f\\right)=N_{0}\\left(M^{p}F M^{q}f\\right)=N_{0}\\left(F D^{p}M^{q}f\\right)$ by the “commutation formulae” (31.2\") and (31.6). Now, in general, \n$$\nN_{0}(F f)=\\operatorname*{sup}\\left|\\int f(x){\\overline{{\\mathbf{e}(x y)}}}d x\\right|\\leq\\int|f(x)|d x=\\|f\\|_{1};\n$$\nsince the function $(x^{2}+1)f(x)$ is bounded by $N_{2}(f)$ , by (3), one finds \n$$\nN_{0}(F f)\\leq N_{2}(f)\\int\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)^{-1}d x,\n$$\nwith a convergent integral whose exact value, $c=\\pi$ , is not important. It followsthat \n$$\nN_{p,q}(\\hat{f})=N_{0}\\left(F D^{p}M^{q}f\\right)\\leq c N_{2}\\left(D^{p}M^{q}f\\right);\n$$\non applying (5) $p$ timestothefunction $M^{q}f$ one finds a result $\\leq N_{p+2}\\left(M^{q}f\\right)$ uptoaconstantfactor,andbyapplying(6) $q$ times to $f$ oneobtainsarelation of the form $N_{p,q}(\\hat{f})\\leq N_{p+q+2}(f)$ uptoaconstantfactor.Rememberingthe definition (3) of $N_{r}$ , we finally have \n$$\nN_{r}(\\hat{f})\\leq c_{r}^{\\prime}N_{r+2}(f)\n$$\nwhere $c_{r}^{\\prime}$ is a new constant. This proves the continuity of the Fourier transform. Since it is bijective and quasi identical to its inverse map by virtue of the relation ${\\widehat{\\widehat{f}}}(x)=f(-x)$ ,we conclude that the Fourier transform is a bijective and bicontinuous map of $s$ onto $s$ , in other words what in topology one callsahomeomorphism (linear too)of $s$ onto $s$ \nWith their systematicrecourse to the operators $D,M$ and $F$ ,thesecalculations can appear a little abstract. But to write explicitly the integrals and derivatives which they mask would be even less enticing. \nWe can now return to distribution theory. Following Schwartz, we will call any continuous linear form $T:S\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}$ atempereddistributionon $\\mathbb{H}$ .The inequality $\\vert T(f)\\vert<\\varepsilon$ has to hold for every $f\\in S$ “close enough” to O; this means that there exists an $r\\in\\mathbb N$ anda $\\delta>0$ such that"
