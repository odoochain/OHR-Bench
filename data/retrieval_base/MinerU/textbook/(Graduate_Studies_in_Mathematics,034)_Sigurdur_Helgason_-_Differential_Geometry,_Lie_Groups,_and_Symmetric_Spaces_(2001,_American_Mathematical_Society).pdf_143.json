Let $X_{1},...,X_{n}$ be a basis of $g$ and $\\omega_{1},...,\\omega_{n}$ the 1-forms on $G$ determined by $\\omega_{i}(\\tilde{X}_{j})=\\delta_{i j}$ Then \n$$\nd\\omega_{i}=-\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sum_{j,k=1}^{n}c^{i}{}_{j k}\\omega_{j}\\wedge\\omega_{k}\n$$\n$c^{i}{}_{j k}$ are the structural constants given by \n$$\n[X_{j},X_{k}]=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c^{i}{}_{j k}X_{i}.\n$$\nEquations (3) are known as the Maurer-Cartan equations. They follow immediately from (1). They also follow from Theorem 8.1, ChapterIifwegive $G$ the left invariant affne connection for which $\\alpha$ in Prop.1.4is identically 0.Note that the Jacobi identity for $g$ isreflected intherelation $d^{2}=0$ \nExample. Consider as in $\\S1$ the general linear group $G L(n,R)$ with the usual coordinates $\\sigma\\rightarrow(x_{i j}(\\sigma))$ .Writing $X=(x_{i j})$ $d X=(d x_{i j})$ ,the matrix \n$$\n{\\mathcal{Q}}=X^{-1}d X,\n$$\nwhose entries are 1-forms on $G$ is invariant under left translations $X\\to\\sigma X$ on $G$ .Writing \n$$\nd X=X\\varOmega,\n$$\nwe can derive \n$$\n0=(d X)\\wedge\\Omega+X\\wedge d\\Omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\Lambda$ denote the obvious wedge product of matrices. Multiplying by $X^{-1}$ ,weobtain \n$$\nd\\Omega+\\Omega\\wedge\\Omega=0,\n$$\nwhich is an equivalent form of (3) \nMore generally, consider for each $\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{X}}$ in the Lie group $G$ the mapping \n$$\nd L(x^{-1})_{x}:G_{x}\\to{\\mathfrak{g}}\n$$\nandlet $\\Omega$ denote the family of these maps.In other words, \n$$\n\\Omega_{x}(v)=d L(x^{-1})(v)\\qquad\\mathrm{~if~}v\\in G_{x}.\n$$\nThen $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is a 1-form on $G$ with values in $g$ .Moreover, if $x,y\\in G$ then \n$$\n\\Omega_{x y}\\circ d L(x)_{y}=\\Omega_{y},\n$$"
