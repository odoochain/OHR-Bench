Tree height, mother diameter, daughter diameter, and angle betweenbranches of the basal node were measured using ImageJ (NIH). For each model a regression compared observed data for mother and daughter attributes,and predicted values were generatedusingresidualsfrom theobserved dataregression.AnANcovAcompared slope and y-intercept of theobserved regression and thepredicted. \nFigure 1.Full tree image for a Ginkgo. \nFigure 2.Node 1 imagefora Ginkgo. \nFigure3.
