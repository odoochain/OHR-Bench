A parametrized surface need not be one-to-one. For example, the function $\\sigma:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined as $\\sigma(u,v)=(\\cos u,\\sin u,v)$ is a parametrized surface that wraps the plane infinitely many times around the cylinder; the restriction of this function to a smaller domain was used in Example 3.23 as a surface patch for the cylinder. Exercise 3.27 in this section (illustrated in Fig. 3.17) showsa parametrized surface thatfailstobe one-to-one because of more complicated kinds of self-intersections. In studying only local properties, it doesn't matter whether one works with regular surfaces or parametrized surfaces, because of the following proposition: \n# \nIf $\\sigma:U\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a parametrized surface, then for each $q_{0}\\in U$ ,there ecists an open set $\\tilde{U}\\subset U$ containing $q_{0}$ such that the image $S=\\sigma(\\tilde{U})$ is a regular surface covered by $a$ single surface patch (namely, the restriction of $\\sigma$ to $U$ \nPROOF.Let $q_{0}\\in U$ . Choose any $N\\in\\mathbb{P}^{3}$ with $N\\notin\\mathrm{span}\\{\\sigma_{u}(q_{0}),\\sigma_{v}(q_{0})\\}$ Consider the smooth function $f:U\\times\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined as follows: \n$$\nf(q,t)=\\sigma(q)+t N.\n$$\nSet $p_{0}=\\sigma(q_{0})=f(q_{0},0)$ The derivative $d f_{(q_{0},0)}:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is invertible, becauseitsendsthebasis $\\{e_{1},e_{2},e_{3}\\}$ to the basis $\\{\\sigma_{u}(q_{0}),\\sigma_{v}(q_{0}),N\\}$ .By the inverse function theorem (on page 120), $f$ restrictsto a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood, $\\mathcal A$ ,of $(q_{0},0)$ in $U\\times\\mathbb{R}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\times\\mathbb{R}=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ to a neighborhood, $\\boldsymbol{B}$ of $p_{0}$ in $\\mathbb{P}_{\\leq}^{3}$ . We can assume (after possibly shrinking the neighborhoods) that $\\lrcorner A$ has the form $\\mathcal{A}=\\tilde{U}\\times(-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$ ,where $E>0$ and $\\tilde{U}\\subset U$ is a neighborhood of $q_{0}$ \nDefine $S=\\sigma(\\tilde{U})$ .Since $f$ is injective on $\\cdot^{A}$ , it follows that $o$ is injective on $\\tilde{U}$ , so it has an inverse $\\sigma^{-1}:S\\rightarrow{\\tilde{U}}$ . It remains to prove that $\\sigma^{-1}$ is smooth. For this, $\\operatorname{let}P:A\\rightarrow U$ denote the natural projection that maps $(q,t)\\mapsto q$ .The function $P\\circ f^{-1}:B\\to{\\tilde{U}}$ is a smooth function that agrees with $\\sigma^{-1}$ on $B\\cap S$ ,which verifies that $\\sigma^{-1}$ is smooth. Âè£ \nIn light of Proposition 3.29, you might guess that the image of every injective parametrized surface is a regular surface, but counterexamples to this guess will be given in Sect. 10."
