A smectic ripple phase ${\\pmb P}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ is observed in hydrated lipid bilayers between the $\\pmb{L}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ and $L_{\\alpha}$ phase.This phaseis characterized by corrugations of the membrane surfacewith well-defined periodicity with an axis parallel to the mean bilayer plane [1]. The molecular origin of ripple-phase formation is traditionally been associated with the lipid headgroup region and hence lipids can be classified into ripple-forming and non-ripple forming lipids based on their headgroups. One of the lipid families belonging to ripple-forming class is phosphatidylcholines and has been studied in extensive detail [1]. \nSchemeaboveshowsdifferentphysicalstatesadoptedbyalipidbilayerinaqueousmedium[2] \n# \nThe existence of the ripple phase at first sight is paradoxical on thermodynamic grounds since it involves an apparent lowering of symmetry(from $\\pmb{L}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ to $P_{\\beta^{'}}$ ï¼‰on increasing the temperature.Somemodels suggest thatripplesexist because ofperiodic local spontaneous curvature in thelipid bilayersformed due to electrostatic coupling between water molecules and the polar headgroups or coupling between membrane curvature and molecular tilt.It has also been speculated that ripples form to relieve packing frustrations that arise whenever the relationship between head-group cross sectional area and cross-sectional area of the apolar tails exceeds a certain threshold [1]. However, there is not one conclusive theory to explain ripple phaseformation. \n# \n\nExperimentalphasediagramfor(1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)DMPC,plottedasafunctionof temperature and hydration.Solid lines indicate first order transitions.Arrows indicate directions of increasing tilt in the $\\mathbf{\\delta}L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ phase.The rightmostschematicshows,fromtoptobottom,theformsof thephases $L_{\\infty}P_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ and $\\scriptstyle L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$ [3]"
