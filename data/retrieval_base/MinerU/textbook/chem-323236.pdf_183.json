Examples include such familiar substancesaswater $\\mathrm{(H_{2}O)}$ andcarbondioxide $\\mathrm{{(CO_{2})}}$ .These compounds arevery differentfromionic compounds like sodium chloride $\\mathrm{(NaCl)}$ .Ionic compounds are formed when metal atoms lose one or more of their electrons to nonmetal atoms. The resultingcations and anions areelectrostaticallyattractedtoeachother. \nSowhat holds the atoms ofa molecule together?Rather thanformingions,theatoms of a molecule share their electronsin such a way that a bond forms between a pair of atoms. In a carbon dioxide molecule, there are two of these bonds, each occurring betweenthecarbonatomandoneofthetwooxygenatoms. \nFigure 5.8.1: Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a central carbon atom bonded to 2 oxygen atoms. \nLarger molecules can have many, many bonds that serve tokeep the molecule together. In a large sample of a given molecula ompound, all of theindividual molecules areidentical. \n# \nRecall that a molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element that a molecule contains.A molecule of water contains twohydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, so itsformula is $_\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ Amoleculeof octane,which isacomponent ofgasoline, contains 8 atoms of carbon and 18 atoms of hydrogen. The molecular formula of octane is $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{18}$ \nFigure5.8.2:Nitrogen dioxide $(\\mathrm{NO}_{2})$ isa reddish-brown toxic gas that isa prominent air pollutant produced by internal combustionengines. \nNaming binary (two-element) molecular compounds is similar to naming simple ionic compounds. The first element in the formula is simply listed usingthe name of the element.The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding the suffix -ide.A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule. Table 5.8.1 lists these numericalprefixes. \nTable5.8.1:NumericalPrefixesfor Naming Binary Covalent Compounds \n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\nNumberofAtomsinCompound & PrefixontheNameoftheElement \\\\\n1 & mono-* \\\\\n2 & di- \\\\\n3 & tri- \\\\\n4 & tetra- \\\\\n5 & penta- \\\\\n6 & hexa- \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"
