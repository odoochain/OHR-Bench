Notice that in Likert scales, the statement changes but the anchors remain the same across items.However,in semantic differential scales,the statement remains constant,while the anchors (adjective pairs)change across items. Semantic differential is believed to be an excellent technique for measuring people's atitude or feelings toward objects,events,orbehaviors. \nGuttman scale.Designed byLouis Guttman, this composite scale uses a series of items arrangedin increasing order of intensity of the construct of interest, from least intense to most intense. As an example, the construct “attitude toward immigrants” can be measured using five items shown in Table 6.5.Each item in the above Guttman scale has a weight(not indicated above) which varies with the intensity of that item,and the weighted combination of eachresponse is used as aggregate measure of an observation. \nHowwill you rateyour opinions on thefollowingstatements about immigrants? \nable6.5.Afive-itemGuttman scaleformeasuring attitude towardimmigrants \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nDoyoumindimmigrantsbeingcitizensof yourcountry & Yes & No \\\\\nDoyou mind immigrants living in your own neighborhood & Yes & No \\\\\nWouldyoumindlivingnextdoortoan immigrant & Yes & No \\\\\nWouldyoumindhavinganimmigrantasyour closefriend & Yes & No \\\\\nWouldyoumindifsomeoneinyourfamily marriedanimmigrant & Yes & No \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nThe previous section discussed how to measure respondents’responses topredesigned items or indicators belonging to an underlying construct. But how do we create the indicators themselves? The process of creating the indicators is called scaling. Moreformally,scalingis abranchof measurement that involves theconstruction of measuresby associatingqualitativejudgments about unobservable constructs with quantitative,measurable metric units. Stevens (1946) said,“Scaling is the assignment of objects to numbers according to a rule.\" This process of measuring abstract concepts in concrete terms remains one of the most difficult tasksinempiricalsocialscienceresearch. \nThe outcome of a scaling process is a scale , which is an empirical structure for measuring items or indicators of a given construct. Understand that “scales\", as discussed in this section, are a little different from“rating scales”discussed in the previous section.A rating scale is used to capture the respondents’reactions to a given item,for instance, such as a nominal scaled item captures a yes/no reaction and an interval scaled item captures a value between “strongly disagree” to“strongly agree.\"Attaching a rating"
