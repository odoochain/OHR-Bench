Heuristically,when $V\\equiv1$ ,thefirst term in (3.34) and(3.35) is due to thevolume energy which always has a tendency to “shrink”(in order to minimize), while the second term $\\pm\\beta e^{-2\\lambda(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}-\\rho)}$ n (335 334),ivlith ta the boundary“pushes”the mass of the solution away from the boundary (therefore only single-peak solutions are possible), but in the Neumann case the boundary “pulls” the mass of the solution and thereby reaches a balance at $\\varepsilon\\rho=r_{\\varepsilon}\\sim1-\\varepsilon|\\log\\varepsilon|$ creating an extra solution. \nWe remark that the method described above also applies to the annulus case and yields the following interesting results for $V\\equiv1$ ,which illustrate the opposite effectsbetween Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions most vividly. \n# \n(i) For every $p>1$ and $E$ small,theNeumann problem(3.1)with $\\Omega=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\mid0<a<$ $|x|<b\\}$ possesses a solution concentrating at $|\\boldsymbol{x}|=r_{\\varepsilon}$ ,where $b-r_{\\varepsilon}\\sim\\varepsilon|\\log\\varepsilon|$ ,near the outer boundary $|x|=b$   \n(ii) For every $p>1$ and $E$ small,theDirichlet problem(3.2)with $\\Omega=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\left|0<a<\\right.$ $|x|<b\\}$ possesses a solution concentrating at $|x|=r_{\\varepsilon}$ ,where $r_{\\varepsilon}-a\\sim\\varepsilon|\\log\\varepsilon|$ ,near the inner boundary $|x|=a$ \nObserve that from the “moving plane” method [GNN1] it follows easily that the Dirichlet problem (3.2) does not have a solution concentrating on a sphere near the outer boundary $|x|=b$ \nIn conclusion, we mention that the method of Theorem 3.10 can be extended to producesolutionswith $k$ -dimensional concentration sets, but again, some symmetry assumptions are needed. Other interesting progress in this direction includes a one-dimensional concentration set in the interior of a two-dimensional domain due to [WY]. The conjecture stated at the beginning of this section remains largely a major open problem. \n# \nIn Section 3.1, we have considered the various concentration phenomena for essentially just one equation, namely, \n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\varepsilon^{2}\\Delta u-u+u^{p}=0}\\end{array}\n$$\ninaboundeddomain $\\Omega$ under either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions in (3.2) or (3.1), respectively. However, since (3.36) is quite basic, similar phenomena could be"
