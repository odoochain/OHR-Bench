        "text": "No.7 - May 1952 \n# \nLivestock pests cost the Nation an annual loss estimated at over half a billion dollars. Farmers and the Nation as a whole bear the brunt of this loss in wasted feed, damaged hides, and both lowered quality and reduced out put in such essential animal products as meat, milk, eggs, wool, and leather. \nFlies cut deeply into beef and milk production. Insects keep pastured animals from grazing adequately when feeding costs normally are lowest. Cattle grubs do much damage to hides and may also reduce output of beef and milk. Ticks, lice, screw-worms, and sheep ticks take an immense toll in unproduced meat and fibers which should go for food and clothing. Infested animals are \"hard keepers\" and cannot produce good quality meat. \nFortunately most of these losses can be reduced or eliminated. Individual farmers can do much to protect their own livestock but community cooperation can do even more. United action makes for better and thriftier control of sheep ticks, lice, screw-worns, cattle grubs and other pests. \nTo achieve these objectives, farmers and ranchers must know what insects attack animals, what insecticides to use, the correct formula, and methods of application. County agents, entomologists, veterinarians, and other specialists can render important service in pro viding information and leadership in programs to get the more harmful livestock pests under control. \nThis fact sheet presents basic, up-to-date control measures as source material for Extension workers and others who write and broadcast information for farmer s. Farmers should be advised to consult their county agent, other extension specialists, state entomologists or veterinarians, or the publications Listedonpage 4. \n# \nToxaphene sprays of 0.5 percent concentration give immediate and lasting effect on the lone star, winter, Gulf Coast, and spinose ear ticks. Sprays combining 0.5 percent DDT and .025 percent gamma benzine hexachloride are also effective. Neither are recommended for dairy cattle, however. \nExcept for the spinose ear tick, treat animals thoroughly on all parts of their bodies. For the Gulf Coast ear tick, treat especialiy the ears, head, and neck. Far the spinose ear tick, use low pressure mist sprayer on the neck, head, and inside and outside of the ear. The spinose ear tick may also be controlled with a prepar ation cont aining 5 parts of 12 percent gamma BHC, 10 parts xylene and 85 parts steam-distilled pine oil."

        "text": "Proper livestock management practices are important in controlling screwworms. These include gentle handling of animals, avoiding surgical operations if possible when screw-worms are active, controlling ticks--especially ear ticks, inspecting animals at least twice a week, treating all wounds with recommended screw-wound remedies, and inspecting animals when shipped out and also when delivered from areas where screw-worms occur. \nObserve infested animals regularly. Treat once each week with E.Q. Smear $335$ or twice weekly with E.Q. Smear 62 or E.Q. Smear 82. If attack is severe, E.Q。 $335$ may have to be used twice during the first week. Apply ointment with a l-inch paint brush, smearing well into center of wound and surrounding area. \n# \nAttack by larvae of blow flies, which occur on sheep in the crotch region where wool has become soiled, can usually be prevented by \"tagging\" or clipping wool on this part of the animal early in the spring. If maggots do occur, treat with 1 part E.Q. 335 screw-worm remedy to 9 parts water. Water solutions containing toxaphene or chlordane may also be used. \n# \nThe right insecticides correctly applied can practically eliminate lice from hogs. One thorough spraying of DDT, TDE, methoxychlor, toxaphene, or chlordane with a concentration of 0.5 to 0.75 percent will give excellent control. Lindane or benzene hexachloride (BHC) with a 0.05 or 0.06 percent concentration are equally effective. Dips with the same concentration as the sprays are even more effecti ve than spraying. \n# \nBy thoroughly treating all parts of the animal, both sucking and biting lice on cattle are readily controlled. Hand sprayers may be used for small herds but power sprayers are most practical for larger herds. Dusts may be used when spraying is considered inadvisable during winter months. \nFor beef cattle, recommended sprays include DDT, TDE, methoxychlor, toxaphene, and chlordane. A thorough treatment with a O.5 percent spray will usuaily give satisfactory control but second treatment may be necessary after ll to 18 days. Lindane may be used as a spray on young cattle under a year old at concentrations of 0.03 percent, or for older cattle at a concentration up to 0.05 percent. \nChlordane should not be used at more than 3=month intervals since its safety for more frequent applications has not been established. Sprays or dips containing l pound of 5 percent rotenone for each lo0 gallons of water are effective but two treatments wiil be required. Insecticides containing pyrethrum plus piperonyl butoxide are also effective against lice. \nFor controlling the tail louse, prevalent in Florida, use a concentration of 1- to l.5-percent DDT or methoxychlor. Treat the switch of the tail as well as other parts of the body. \nPowders containing l0 percent of DDT or methoxychlor, l percent lindane, or 1 percent rotenone may be used in dusts for controlling lice on beef cattle. The dust must be rubbed into the hair of the animal. \nFor dairy cows, rotenone, methoxychlor, lindane sprays and dusts, and the pyrethrum-piperonyI butoxide sprays are the only materials recommended to control lice. Apply in same concentrations and with same methods used on beef cattle."

        "text": "# \nApply 5 percent rotenone at 30-day intervals during_grub season. Treat all cattle in an area. Spraying by power sprayer with 400-450 pounds! nozzle pressure gives fast and effective control. If such equipment is not available consult your experiment station about the use of lower pressure sprayers. \nCompletely saturate infested areas on the back of each animal. Use 7 1/2 pounds of the rotenone powder to l00 gallons of water. Dusts, dips, and washes may also be used but are slower and more laborious than spraying. \n# \nFor controlling lice on poultry, use sodium flouride--l ounce to l gallon of water--as a dip or by the pinch or dusting method, or a 5 percent DDT dust. A l-percent lindane solution with water or oil or nicotine sulfate may be applied to' the roosts but these two may not be entirely effective on the head louse. \nFor common fowl mites and fowl ticks, birds should have clean housing and nests. Treat cracks, crevices, walls, and roosts of poultry houses with sprays of lindane of 0.25 to 0.5 percent concentration, creosote, carbolineum, kerosene, or 5 percent DDT. Do not use lindane on floors until its safety for birds is better known. Heavy treatment of litter with sulfur may control mites. \nTo control stick-tight fleas, apply a 5 percent DDT oil or emulsion spray or 2.5 percent wettable powder spray to floors of infested houses or grounds. A light application of a 5 to l0 percent DDT dust may also be used. \n# \nDipping is the surest way to eliminate sheep ticks or lice from herds. For sheep ticks, dips may be made using 8 ounces derris or cube containing 5 percent rotenone for each lo0 gallons of water. For lice, double the strength of this rotenone dip. For either sheep ticks or lice, dips may be made with 0.25 percent DDT, TDE, methoxychlor, toxaphene, chlordane or .025 percent of gamma benzine hexachloride. \nSprays using double the strength recommended for dips and thoroughly applied give excellent but not always complete control of these lice. In spraying treat animals soon after shearing or at least before the wool or mohair reaches a length of about 2 inches. Dusts containing 0.5 to 1 percent rotenone, rubbed well into wool, may also be used for sheep tick control. \n# \nTo control house flies, use screens and keep premises clean. Use residual sprays--which give lasting_ effect--on surfaces where flies rest except feed troughs and watering cups. Use only methoxychlor or lindane in dairy barns. Outside dairy barns and milk rooms, DDT or chlordane may also be used.. For stable flies, follow suggestions for controlling the housefly and treat animals with pyrethrum sprays. \nFor horn flies, 0.5 percent DDT, methoxychlor, TDE, or toxaphene give good results on beef cattle. But only methoxychlor and pyrethrum sprays are recommended for dairy cows. \nTo supplement residual sprays, atomized mist sprays or aerosols of pyrethrum or allethrin are effective for house and stable flies. \nHorse flies and deer flies are difficult to control although pyrethrum sprays give fairly good pro tection to cattle."
