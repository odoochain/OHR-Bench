Assume further that the maps $\\alpha_{p};G\\to M$ $g1\\rightarrow$ rg are injections for cvery $p\\in M$ Show that the $G$ manifold has the structure of a differentiable $G$ -principal bundle. \n4. Show that a bijcctive imncrsionl of diffcrcntiable manifolds is a diffeomorphism. Hint: An immcrsion $f:M\\to N$ is locally an embedding. If we lhad dim $N>$ dim M, then $f(M)$ would lhavc Lebcsguc ncasurc zero (locally) in $N$ (see Br?cker and Janich: [1]. \\$6). \n5. Show that any two fbers of the Hopf fibration (4.10) are linked in $S^{3}$ : see Hopf [1]: \nFigure 12 \n6. Givc a difeomorphism $\\mathbb{S}{\\mathsf{O}}(3)\\cong\\mathbb{R}P^{3}$ , and,if you know enough about fundamental groups, show that $\\pi_{1}(\\mathbb{S}\\mathbf{O}(n))\\cong\\mathbb{Z}/2$ for $n>2$ with a gencrator rcpresentcd by the mapping $S^{1}=\\mathsf{S O}(1)\\stackrel{\\in}{\\to}\\mathsf{S O}(n),$ \n7. Show that $\\mathbb{S p}(n)$ is simply connected. Show that SU(n) is simply connected. \n8. Show that thcrc is a $G$ -equivariant difcomorphism of homogeneous spaces $G/H^{\\prime}$ $G/K$ if and only if $11$ and $\\kappa$ are conjugate in $G$ \n$9$ . Show that a homomorphism of tori $T^{n}\\rightarrow T^{k}$ is induced by a lincar map $A^{n}\\rightarrow R^{k}$ whose associated matrix has integer coefhicients. \n10. Show that the only noncompact topologically cyclic Lie group is $z.$ \n11. Let G be a Lie group and let $X,Y\\in\\ L(G).$ .
