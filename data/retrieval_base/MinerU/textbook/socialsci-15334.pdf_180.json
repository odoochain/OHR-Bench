These changes are forcing magazines to adapt to an increasingly online market. \n# \nIn 1995, Salon launched the first major online-only magazine at http://www.salon.com.“Salon, the award-winning online news and entertainmentwebsite,combines original investigative stories,breakingnews,provocative personal essays and highlyrespected criticism along with popular staff-writen blogs about politics, technology and culture.\"Salon, “Salon Fact Sheet,\" www.salon.com/press/fact/.Like many print magazines, the site divides content into sections including entertainment, books, comics,life,news and politics,and technology and business.With an average of 5.8 million monthlyunique visitors, this online magazine demonstrates the potential successes of Internet-based publications.Salon,“Salon Fact Sheet,\" www.salon.com/press/fact/. \nOther online-only magazines include Slate and PC Magazine. All three magazines,like most online publications, support themselves in part through ads that appear alongside articles and other content. Founded in 1996, Slate is a “general interest publication offering analysis and commentary about politics,news, and culture.\"Slate,“About Us:Everything you need to know about Slate,” htp://www.slate.com/id/2147070/. Considering itself “a daily magazine on the Web,” Slate offers its readers information on news and politics, arts, life, busines, technology, and science via online articles, podcasts, and blogs.Slate,“About Us: Everything you need to know about Slate,”http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/.The successful magazine has been recognized withnumerous awardsfor itscontributionstojournalism. \nPC Magazine differs somewhat from Slate or Salon in that it was originally a print publication.First published in 1982, the computer magazine published hard-copy issues for over 15 years before announcing in 2008 that its January 2009 issue would be its last printed edition. In an open letter to its readers,PC Magazine discussed the transition: \nStarting in February 2009,PC Magazine will become a 100-percent digital publication. So, in addition to our popular network of Websites...we'llofferPCMagazineDigitalEditiontoallofourprintsubscribers.ThePCMagazineDigitalEditionhasactually been available since 2002.Sofor thousands of you, the benefits of this unique medium are already clear.And thosebenefits will continue to multiply in the coming months, as we work hard to enhance your digital experience.Lance Ulanoff,“PC Magazine Goes $100\\%$ Digital,\" (2008), PC Magazine, http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp. \nWhile it is perhaps fitting that this computer-focused publication is one of the first print magazines to move to an entirely online form,itsreasonsforthe transitionwere financialrather than creative.Indescribing the decision,JasonYoung,chief executiveof Ziff Davis Media, said, “[tJhe viability for us to continue to publish in print just isn't there anymore.\"Stephanie Clifford, “PC Magazine,a Flagship for Ziff Davis, Will Cease Printing a Paper Version,” New York Times, November 19, 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/media/20mag.html. Unfortunately for the magazine industry, Young's sentiment reflects a trend that has been building for some time.Several other publications have followed in PC Magazine's footsteps,making themovefrom print toonline-only.Journalssuch asElleGirl andTeenPeoplethatwereonceavailableinprint cannowbeviewed only via the Internet. As printing costs rise and advertising and subscription revenues decrease, more magazines willikely be makingsimilar shifts."
