As in the chordal case, we are in fact going to focus on the conformalgeometry ofthe complement $H_{t}$ of $K_{t}$ in the unit disc U. One first has to find a natural time-parametrization. It turns out to be convenient to define the conformal map $g_{t}$ from $H_{t}$ onto $[[]]$ that is normalised by \n$$\ng_{t}(0)=0\\mathrm{~and~}g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)>0.\n$$\nNote that $g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)\\geq1$ .This can be for instance derived using the fact that $\\log g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)$ is the limit when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ of $\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ times the probability that a planarBrownian motion startedfrom $E$ hitsthecircleofradius $\\varepsilon^{2}$ before exiting $H_{t}$ (an analyst would find this justification very strange, for sure). \nThen (and this is simply because with obvious notation, $(\\tilde{g}_{s}\\circ g_{t})(0)=$ $\\tilde{g}_{s}(0)\\circ g_{t}^{\\prime}(0))$ , one measures the “size” $a(K_{t})$ of $K_{t}$ via the derivative of $g_{t}$ at the origin: \n$$\ng_{t}^{\\prime}(0)=\\exp(a(t)).\n$$\nHence, we will consider growing families of compact sets such that $a(K_{t})=t$ Supposenowthat $(\\zeta_{t},t\\geq0)$ isacontinuousfunctionontheunitcircle $\\partial\\mathbb{U}$ .Define forall $z\\in\\overline{{\\mathbb{U}}}$ ,the solution $g_{t}(z)$ totheODE \n$$\n\\partial_{t}g_{t}(z)=-g_{t}(z)\\frac{g_{t}(z)+\\zeta_{t}}{g_{t}(z)-\\zeta_{t}}\n$$\nsuchthat $g_{0}(z)=z$ . This solution is well-defined up to the (possibly infinite time $T(z)$ defined by \n$$\nT(z)=\\operatorname*{sup}\\{t>0:\\operatorname*{min}_{s\\in[0,t)}|g_{s}(z)-\\zeta_{s}|>0\\}.\n$$\nWethendefine \n$$\nK_{t}:=\\{z\\in\\overline{{\\mathbb{U}}}:T(z)\\leq t\\}\n$$\nand \n$$\nU_{t}:=\\mathbb{U}\\setminus K_{t}.\n$$\nThe family $(K_{t},t\\ge0)$ is called the (radial) Loewner chain associated to the drivingfunction $5$ \nThe general statements that we described in the chordal case are also valid in this radial case. One can add one feature that has no analog in the chordal case:It is possible to estimate the Euclidean distance $d_{t}$ from 0 to $K_{t}$ in terms of $a(t)=t$ .Indeed, since $U_{t}$ contains the disc $d_{t}\\times\\mathbb{U}$ ,it is clear that $g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)\\leq1/d_{t}$ . On the other hand, a classical result of the theory of"
