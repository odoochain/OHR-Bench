If (5.1) holds for all $k$ and $t_{1},\\cdots,t_{k}$ ,andif $\\{P_{n}\\}$ isrelatively compact, then (5.2) holds. \nProof. Since $\\{P_{n}\\}$ is relatively compact, each subsequence $\\{P_{n_{i}}\\}$ contains a   \nfurther subsequence $\\{P_{n_{i_{m}}}\\}$ such that $P_{n_{i_{m}}}\\Rightarrow Q$ as $m\\rightarrow\\infty$ for some probability $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ $C$ $P_{n_{i_{m}}}\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}\\Rightarrow Q\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}$ ${\\mathcal{Q}}\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}$   \n$=P{\\pi_{t_{1}\\cdots t_{k}}^{-1}}$ $P$ $e$ $P=Q$ $\\{P_{n}\\}$   \nfurther subsequence converging weakly to $P$ ,and (5.2) follows by Theorem 2.2. \nTheorem 4.1 characterizes relative compactness by tightness. In order to apply Theorem 5.1 in concrete cases,we shall in turn characterize tightness by means oftheArzela-Ascoli theorem. \nFor $x\\in C$ and $\\delta>0$ , the modulus of continuity is defined by \n$$\nw_{x}(\\delta)=\\operatorname*{sup}\\{|x(s)-x(t)|:0\\leq s,t\\leq1,|s-t|<\\delta\\}.\n$$\nAccording to the Arzela-Ascoli theorem,a set $A$ in $C$ has compact closure if and onlyif \n$$\n\\operatorname*{sup}_{x\\in C}x(0)1<\\infty\n$$\nand \n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\delta\\to0}\\operatorname*{sup}_{x\\in C}w_{x}(\\delta)=0.\n$$\nTHEOREM 5.2. $A$ family $\\Pi$ of probability measures on $C$ is tight (hence relatively compact) if and only $j f$ for each $\\eta$ there exists an a such that \n$$\nP\\{x:|x(0)|>a\\}<\\eta,\\qquadP\\in\\Pi,\n$$"
