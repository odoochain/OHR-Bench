        "text": "(ii) Otherwise $4-y$ has the form $\\exists x\\theta(x)$ . In this case let $T_{\\gamma+1}$ be $T_{\\gamma}\\cup\\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\}\\cup$ $\\{\\theta(c)\\}$ where $c$ is a constant in $C$ that does not occur in $T_{\\gamma}\\cup\\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\}$ . Since $T_{\\gamma}$ contains fewer than $f_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\star}$ constants of $C$ , such a $c$ exists. \nSo if $\\beta=\\gamma+1$ ,then $T_{\\beta}=T_{\\gamma+1}$ is obtained by adding at most a sentence or twoto $T_{\\gamma}$ .Since $T_{\\gamma}$ containsatmost $|\\gamma|+\\aleph_{0}$ ofthe constantsin $C$ ,so does $T_{\\beta}$ Moreover, $T_{\\beta}$ can be shown to be consistent in the same manner that $T_{m+1}$ was shown to be consistent in the first claim in the proof of Theorem 4.2. \nNowsupposethat $\\beta$ is not a successor ordinal. Then it is a limit ordinal. In this case, define $T_{\\beta}$ as the set of all $\\nu+$ -sentencesthat occur in $T_{\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma<\\beta$ .Again,we claim that $T_{\\beta}$ is consistent and contains at most $|\\beta|+\\aleph_{0}$ of the constants in $C$ \nClaim 1 $T_{\\beta}$ is consistent. \nProof Suppose $T_{\\beta}$ is not consistent. Then $T_{\\beta}\\vdash\\bot$ for some contradiction $\\bot$ .Since formal proofs are finite, $\\Delta\\vdash\\bot$ for some finite subset $\\Delta$ of $T_{\\beta}$ . Since it is finite, $\\Delta\\subset T_{\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma<\\beta.\\mathrm{But}$ this contradicts our assumption that any such $T_{\\gamma}$ is consistent.We conclude that $T_{\\beta}$ must be consistent as was claimed. \nClaim2 $T_{\\beta}$ contains at most $|\\beta|$ of the constants in $C$ \nProof For each $\\gamma<\\beta$ ,let $C_{\\gamma}$ bethesetofconstantsin $C$ that occur in $T_{\\gamma}$ . Then the constants occurring in $T_{\\beta}$ are $\\cup_{\\gamma\\leq\\beta}C_{\\gamma}$ . By assumption, $|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq|\\gamma|+\\aleph_{0}\\leq$ $|\\beta|+\\aleph_{0}.$ Sinceweareassumingthat $\\beta$ is a limit ordinal, $\\beta$ is infinite. In particular, $\\left|\\beta\\right|+\\aleph_{0}=\\left|\\beta\\right|$ .So each $|C_{\\gamma}|\\le|\\beta|$ .Itfollowsthatthenumberofconstantsfrom $C$ occurring in $T_{\\beta}$ is \n$$\n\\left|\\bigcup_{\\gamma<\\beta}C_{\\gamma}\\right|\\leq\\sum_{\\gamma<\\beta}|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq\\sum_{\\gamma<\\beta}|\\beta|=|\\beta|\\cdot|\\beta|=|\\beta|.\n$$\nThis completes the proof of the claim. \nSo for each $\\beta<\\alpha$ we have successfully defined a $\\nu+$ -theory $T_{\\beta}$ . These have been defined in such a way that $T_{\\beta_{1}}\\subset T_{\\beta_{2}}$ for $\\beta_{1}<\\beta_{2}<\\alpha$ \nWe now define $T_{\\alpha}$ as the set of all $\\nu+$ -sentences that occur in $T_{\\beta}$ for some $\\beta<\\alpha$ . Like each $T_{\\beta}$ ï¼Œ $T_{\\alpha}$ is a theory. This can be proved in the same manner as Claim 1 above. Unlike $T_{\\beta}$ for $\\beta<\\alpha$ $T_{\\alpha}$ is a complete theory. This is because each $\\nu+$ -sentence is enumerated as $f_{L}$ for some $L<\\alpha$ .Either $f l$ or $\\neg\\varphi_{i}$ is in $T_{c+1}{\\mathrm{and}}$ ,hence, in $T_{\\alpha}$ as well. \nSince $\\Gamma=T_{0}\\subset T_{\\alpha}$ $T_{\\alpha}$ has Property 1. Moreover, part (b)i of the definition of $T_{\\gamma+1}\\subset T_{\\alpha}$ guarantees that $T_{\\alpha}$ has Property 2. It was shown in the proof of Theorem 4.2 that any complete theory with Property 2 has a model. Therefore $T_{\\alpha}$ has a model and $\\Gamma$ is satisfiable."
