In a ventricular escape rhythm, the rate is typically 20-40BPM,there arenoPwaves,and theQRScomplexes arewideandbizarre: \nFigure 1.5.27: Image 27, Ventricular Escape Rhythms \nIn an accelerated ventricular rhythm, the irritable ventricular site that has taken over as pacemaker is contracting at a rate ${>}40$ but is not a true ventricular tachycardia.The physiology of this rhythm is similar, but is accelerated due to increased irritability of the pacemakersite: \nFigure 1.5.28:Image 28,Accelerated Ventricular Rhythms \nVentricular tachycardiais essentially theventricularversionof atrialflutter.Withventricular tachycardia the irritableventricular site has taken over as pacemaker by depolarizing rapidly. Ventricular tachycardia is not always an indicator that the SA and AV nodes have failed, as is usually the case with ventricular escape and accelerated ventricular rhythms; instead theventricle has taken over aspacemakerby depolarizing at a ratefasterthantheSAnode. \nFigure 1.5.29: Image 29, Ventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular tachycardiais sometimes pulseless,but not always.If you see or suspect ventricular tachycardia, it is important to check apulsebeforeintervening. \nA patient can also have“runs”of ventricular tachycardia.A run of ventricular tachycardia refers to a rhythm that converts from the underlyingrhythm toventricular tachycardiafor ${>}4$ QRS complexes, then reverts to the underlying rhythm.The reversion is important; it is not a“run”of ventricular tachycardia if it never converts back out of ventricular tachycardia."
