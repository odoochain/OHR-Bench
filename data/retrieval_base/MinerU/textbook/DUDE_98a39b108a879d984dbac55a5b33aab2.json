This competition provides students with an opportunity to gain valuable design experience and showcase their talents to LLNL staff. Students who would like to participate are encouraged to form multidisciplinary teams of 4-6 students and submit their resumes to the MEP office (application details provided later). \nSix teams will be selected and each team will be provided with a basic 450-quadcopter drone kit, similar to the kit shown in Figure 1, and a budget to purchase additional parts or materials. The teams will/can then participate in three competitions: Drones winning fastest course time trial, drones able to carry the most weight over the longest distance, and the best design review. \nPrizes include:   \nTrophies   \nLLNL T-Shirts and bennies   \nGroup tour of LLNL’s laser, additive manufacturing and Supercomputers   \nCredit towards usage of the AM machines at Cal Poly \nFigure 1 Example of 450-Quadcopter Kit \nSource: https://pixhawk.org/platforms/multicopters/dji_flamewheel_450"

In the CDR teams should formally define the scope of the project, discuss specific design requirements, list several proposed concepts, and briefly describe their design selection methodology. \nPrior to CDR, teams should: \n1. Discuss the purpose of the CDR   \n2. Review both challenges and determine specific requirements   \n3. Brainstorm several solutions to the problems presented in both challenges   \n4. Investigate new materials and fabrication processes   \n5. Discuss a plan for performing analysis, manufacturing, and testing   \n6. Create a Gantt chart to show your proposed timeline"
