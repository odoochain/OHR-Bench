Thevalues on the $\\times$ axiscorrespond to the number of times that a particular 13-mer is found inthe analysis region whereas the y-axis correspond to the total number of 13- mers(of all sequences) that appear at each frequency.For example,approximately $10^{6}$ 13-mersappear only once in each analysis region. (B) Cumulative dinucleotide repeats analysis shows a higher frequencyof dinucleotide repeats on the D. mojavensis andD.grimshawiFelements (dark blue and purple lines, respectively) than on the D.mela,nogasterand D.erectaFelements(darkredand orangelines,respectively).A pseudocountof onehasbeen added to thecumulative distribution plots in orderto showa continuousdistribution in thesemi-logplot. \ncandidate is shown in Figure S5.(See File S1 for a more detailed description of this analysis.) \nOverallrepeatdistributionontheFelement:Collctively,therepeat analysisshows theFelements haveahigherrepeat density than the euchromaticreferenceregionsin allfourDrosophila species.It also showsthatalthoughthe $D$ mojavensisand $D_{e}$ grimshawiFelements havesimilartotalrpeatensitiethyhavestrikinglydifferentrat compositions.A total of $75\\%$ of therepeatsthat overlapwitharepeat identifiedbyWindowMaskeron the $D$ mojavensisFelement are transposons (particularly DINE-1 elements) compared to only $27\\%$ onthe $D_{\\ast}$ grimshawiFelement,whereasthe $D_{e}$ grimshawiFelement shows a greater densityof simple andlowcomplexityrepeatsthanthe D.mojavensis F element( $39\\%$ vs. $20\\%$ .These differences in repeat composition could impact the local chromatin structure and thus the evolution of the resident genes. \n# \nDespiteitshigh repeat density,the distal arm of theD.melanogasterF element contains 79 genes,many of which have important developmental and housekeeping functions (Riddle et al.2012).Our manual gene annotations (described previously) show that the D. melanogaster, D.erecta, $D_{-}$ mojavensisandD. grimshawiFelements all have approximately 80genes.The gene density of theFelement is lower than that of the euchromatic reference regions from the D element $\\mathord{\\left(\\sim\\right.\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace}\\sim60$ genes/Mb vs. $\\mathord{\\sim}80$ genes/Mb)for these four species(Table S6).Among the four species,the D.mojavensisF element has the lowest gene density (48 genes/Mb compared with 60-66genes/Mb in the other F elements). This reflects the increased size of theD.mojavensisFelement due to the expansion of repetitious elements (1.7 Mb vs. 1.2-1.3 Mb in the other F elements)(Table S6 andFigure 3). \nAlthough we have produced annotations for all isoforms, our analysis below isbasedonly on the isoform with the largest coding region (i.e.,the most comprehensive isoform)for each gene.Restricting our analysis to the most comprehensive isoform allows us to avoid counting the sameregion multipletimes because of alternative splicing.Weinitially examinedgenes at thebase,extended,and telomeric regions(describedpreviously)ofthe $D$ erectaDelement.Sincethe genes in these three euchromaticregions exhibit similar characteristics,the primary focus of thefollowing analysis is on the comparison ofgenesbetween theFelement andthebase of theDelement(results for all of the analysis regions are available in Figure S6). Summary statistics for all of the gene characteristics,and results of multiple comparison tests after the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) rank sum tests(Kruskal and Wallis 1952), are available in File S6. \nFelementgenesarelargerbecausetheyhavelargerintronsand more coding exons:Comparisons of the distribution of gene characteristics using violin plots (Hintze and Nelson 1998)show that the coding span(i.e.,the region that spans from the start codon to the stop codon, including introns)for F element genes is much larger (median5156-7569 bp)than forgenes at thebase of the D elements (median 1028-1736 bp)(Figure 5, top left).TheKW test shows that this difference is statistically significant (p-value: 2.12E-48). \nPart of this difference in the coding span can be attributed to the significantly higher transposon density (KW test p-value:2.40E-82) within the introns of Felement genes（Figure 5,top center;“repeat size”is the total size of the transposon fragmentswithin theintrons of a gene,in bp).Among the four species analyzed in this study, $71-83\\%$ of the F element genes contain at least one transposon fragment in an intron.In contrast,only $20{-}46\\%$ of theDelementgenescontain at leastone transposon fragment.Consistentwith theresults of the"
