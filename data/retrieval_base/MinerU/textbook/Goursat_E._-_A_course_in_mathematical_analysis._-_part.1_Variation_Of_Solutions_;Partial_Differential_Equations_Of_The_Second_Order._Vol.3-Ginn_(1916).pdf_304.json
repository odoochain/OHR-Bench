We shall say that one of these functions, $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y})$ or $v(x,y)$ ,is regular in a domain $D$ ifit is continuous and has continuous frst partial derivatives in this domain.It will even be sufficient to say that the derivative with respect to $y$ is continuous;for if $\\partial u/\\partial y$ for example,is a continuous function,equation (l) proves that the same is true of $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}u/\\hat{\\sigma}x^{2}$ and, consequently,of $\\hat{c u}/\\hat{o}x$ \nSince equation (l) has constant coefficients,it possesses particular integrals of the form $e^{a x+b y}$ (III,27);the relation between $a$ and $^{b}$ is, in this case, $b=a^{2}.$ From the integral $e^{\\alpha z}+a^{2}y$ thus obtained we can derive any infinity of others by taking its successive derivatives with respect to the parameter $a$ ,or,what amounts to the same thing,by taking the successive coefficients of the expansion of this integral, in powers of $a$ Let us write this expansion in the form \n$$\ne^{a x+a^{2}y}=1+\\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}{\\frac{n^{n}}{n!}}V_{n}(x,y);\n$$\n$V_{n}(x,y)$ isapolynomial ofdegree $n$ in $x,y$ homogeneousin $x$ and $\\sqrt{y}$ \n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{V_{n}(x,y)=x^{n}+n(n-1)x^{n-2}y+\\dots}\\ {\\qquad+\\displaystyle{\\frac{n(n-1)\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot(n-2p+1)}{p!}}x^{n-2p}y^{p}+\\dots{}.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\nwhich is terminated by a term in $y^{\\sharp n}$ if $n$ is even and by a term in $x y^{\\sharp(n-1)}$ ,if $n$ is odd.Thesepolynomials $V_{n}$ are integrals of equation (1),from their very definition.We can easilyverify this by observing that equation (3),differentiated with respect to $x$ and to $y$ gives the relations \n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}V_{n}}{\\hat{\\sigma}x}=n V_{n-1},~\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}V_{n}}{\\hat{\\sigma}y}=n(n-1)~V_{n-2},\n$$\n2Replacing a by $x i$ we again find the integrals $e^{-\\alpha^{2}y}$ $x x,e-x^{2}y$ sin $x=7$ (III,31)."
