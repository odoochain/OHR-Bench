        "text": "TuE discourse on the death of Robert Owen, which concludes this brief ° Life, was several times delivered in London and the provinces; the last time, and in its completest form, in the Public Hall, Rochdale, January, 1859.\" On this occasion Jacob Bright, J.P., presided. \nMr. Jacob Bright was the frst mayor of Rochdale, and is the brother of John Bright, M.P. In his opening remarks on taking the chair, he said, ? Mr. Holyoake, it was known, was well qualified to speak upon Mr. \"Owen, and would no doubt treat the subject with ability.\" Mr. Bright did not say one word as to whether he agreed or disagreed with Mr. Holyoake or Mr. Owen.. That point on which so many chairmen .would have _anxiously exonerated themselves, Mr. Bright said nothing whatever. With the usual courage of his family, he did what he choosed to do because he thought it right to doit, quite careless of consequences. He neither asked permission of the public nor apologised for taking it.\\* \n‘ In acknowledging the tribute paid to the memory of the great philanthropist (by the_presence of Mr. Bright in the chair), the lecturer said he “ knew how to distinguish between courtesy and complicity, and did not infer coincidence of opinion on the part of the chair from that act.\" Mr: Bright, in speaking to the vote of thanks passed to him, expressed his satisfaction at the manner in which the subject had been treated. “ He thought the meeting must be instructed, and be the better for discourses of the character of the one to which they had listened. The lecturer had remarked that ‘ we still live in an age when prejudice was stronger than justice.' That was true ; but when he (Mr. Bright) heard any man generally spoken against by easy-going, well-to-do, and conventional people, he always thought there must be some good in him, and he had on this and other grounds a conviction (though differing in many respects from Mr. Owen) that he was a man of honest ability and benevolence, and deserved the esteem of his country, and this impression, the Discourse to which they had listened that nighthad confirmed.'+ \nZ. Mellor, Esq., Town Clerk of Rochdale, Mr. Alderman Livesy (though only recovering from a severe illness), Mr. Alderman Healey, Mr. Councillor Boothman, R. Mills, Esq., and the leading. members of the Co-operative Store, were amongst the audience present on this night."

        "text": "# \n· GoNe Berore' were the words the Hon. Robert Dale Owen selected to place at the head of the funeral cards, in memory of his illustrious father. The manner of his going was in keeping with the simplicity, calmness, and beauty of his life. \nMr. Owen persisted at his advanced age, in feeble health, and in an inclement month, October, 1858, in going down to Liverpool.But a National Association for the advancement of Social Science stirred the pulses of the venerable propagandist. It was the child of his own genius and labours. At the end of his journey to Liverpool he had to take to his bed. On the day of the meeting--the last public meeting he was destined to appear at-he ordered Mr. Rigby to dress him. His feebleness was such that the operation took two hours. He was then placed in a sedan chair, and carried to the Hall. Four policemen bore him to the platform.' It is now matter of public history, how kindly Lord Brougham, as soon as he saw his old friend, took him by the arm, led him forward, and obtained a hearing for him. Then Mr. Owen, in his grand manner, proclaimed his ancient message of science, competence, and good will to the world. When he came to the conclusion of his frst period, Lord Broughain, out of regard to his failing strength, terminated it. He clapped his hands, applauded his words, then said, Capital, very good, can't be better, Mr. Owen! There, that will do. Then in an under tone, Here, Rigby, convey the old gentleman to his bed.He was carried back.' As soon as he reached his bed he became unconscious. An hour after he revived. \nRigby, Rigby, he called. \n\"Yes, Sir-—here I am' ·How did I speak? What did I say?' ‘O, very well, Sir. I have taken down your words.' -\\*Very good, read them to me. Ah, that will do. Very important, very important.' \n\n\n\nThen he became unconscious again. \nThat scene on the Liverpool platform will not soon die out of recollection. Lord Brougham and Mr. Owen, the two marvellous men who stood there, were a sight not soon to be beheld again. Lord Brougham's vivacity at eighty was as wonderful as Mr. Cwen's undying ardour at eighty-eight. \nFor two weeks he kept his bed at the Victoria Hotel..Mr. Rathbone frequently called to inquire after Mr. Owen's health. Mr. Brown, M.P, and many gentlemen, paid him a similar compliment. Onemorning he  exclaimed,  Rigby,  pack $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{u}}}_{\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}}}}$ we'll go. \n'Go where, Sir---to London ?' °Go to my native place. I will lay my bones whence I derived them.' \n- Dressing, delays, and carryings brought him to the Mersey. He was conveyed over.He took the rail to Shrewsbury. Thence a carriage to travel thirty miles into Wales._When he came to the border line which separates England from Wales he knew it again. It was more than seventy years since he passed over it. He raised himself up in his carriage, and gave a cheer.  He was on his own native land once more. It was the last cheer the old man ever gave. He wanted to persuade Mr. Rigby that he must be sensible of the difference of the atmosphere. With brightened eyes the aged wandererlocked around.The old mountains stood there in their ancient grandeur. The grand old trees, under whose shadow he passed in his youth, waved their branches in welcome.。 What sceneshad the wanderer passed through since last he gazed upon them! Manufacturing gdays,c crowning success, philanthropic experiments, public meetings at the London Tavern, Continental travel, interviews with kings, Mississippi valleys, Indiana forests, journeys, labours, agitations, honours, calumnies, hopes, and never ceasing toil; what a world, what an age had intervened since last he passed his native border."

        "text": "When he reached a beautiful estate he had known in early days, he said, ‘Rigby, we will drive up to the gates, and you ask if Dr. Johns is at home.' The astonished domestic answered, ( Why, Dr. Johns has been dead twenty years.': Once a man and twice a child, was true of Mr. Owen. His early life had come over him like a food. He was in the dreamland of his early days.Dead twenty years, recalled him to the consciousness thatdeath had gone before him and reaped the feld of his youthful memories. Learning that the lady of the house was a daughter ofDr. Johns, he said, Rigby,go and say Robert Owen is at the gate' She no sooner heard that unexpected name, than she came out to the carriage door, and with a woman's quickness saw how it was with the ancient friend of her father.She had him conveyed into her house and placed by the fire. \\*Now, Mr. Owen,' she said, ^you are once more in your own country, among old habits and customs, what shall I get for you ?' His answer showed how deeply his childnood days had come back to him. ‘Make me some fummeryt—wheat and milk; the diet of his father's table. He partook of it.\"He hardly ever ate afterwards. \nHis visit to Newtown was one of curiosity. He arranged to call Mr. Rigby Mr. Friday, and himself Mr. Oliver, and had themselves so reported at the Bear's Head Hotel. When he was able to go out, he had his carriage stopped two doors below, at the house of his birth, and sent in Mr. Rigby to buy two quires of the best note paper, and ask if that was the house in which Mr. Owen was born. It soon appeared that that fact was known and respected, and Mr. David Thomas, the occupant, showed Mr. Rigby the room in which Mr. Owen's birth occurred. Suspecting the truth, he asked Mr. Rigby if the old gentleman in the carriage could be Mr. Owen, Mr. Rigby, who had no orders to own it, and too little diplomatic skill to parry a question in which he was so much interested, neither answered no nor yes, but something_between the two, and Mr. Thomas believed what he was not told. On Mr Thomas delivering the note paper at the carriage window, Mr. Owen, without speaking, took his hand and shook it warmly twice, and ordered his carriage to be driven back to Shrewsbury, and thence to Liverpool he went by railway. Unless for the pleasure of seeing the old country again by passing through it, and of re-appearing in Newtown as a visitor in his own proper name, one knows not the purpose of this journey. Mr. Owen had sent a letter to Mr. David Thomas, of Newtown, saying that provided a public meeting could be convened by the principal inhabitants, he should be happy to proclaiman importantmessage to the people,be the guest of Mr. Thomas, and sleep once more in the house of his birth.The ruling passion was strong in death.When he reached Shrewsbury on his return, he went to the Lion Hotel, and took to his bed again.From thence, by request, he was carried to his carriage, and once more retraced his steps to Newtown.He dwelt by the way upon all the early scenes of his youth, and pointed out to Mr. Rigby various objects of interest to him.He entered Newtown now in his own way, and in his own name. Though he had promised Mr. Thomas'to be his guest, he would not present himself at his house until he was recovered--it being contrary to his ideas of courtesy. He took up his residence at the Bear's Head Hotel, two doors from his birth-place, He slept in room No.3 ; he died in room No. 14. He now desired Mr. Rigby to return to London, and send down Mr. Dale Owen, and he remained alone at the Bear's Head. Mr. Lewis, a bookseller in Newtown, rendered him _attentions during several days, which Mr. Owen valued highly, and Mr. David Thomas was assiduous in kind offices to him. During a week he took only sugar and water. Dr. Slyman, of Newtown Hall, was his medical attendant. Mr. Owen, though never an abstainer from wine, was most temperate in his habits; and though most essential to him in his exhausted state, declined to take stimulants now. Dr. Slyman considers that he might have recovered if he had. Climatic disease, bronchitis being an accompaniment, is the explanation Dr. Slyman gave me of the immediate cause of his death.Two or three days before his death Mr. D. Thomas asked Mr. Owen (the Rector having called) whether he should invite him up, and whetherhe should read to him from the Bible and make some exhortation. Mr. Owen turned his head,and said in his commanding way,No,no.Mr.Owenwas much better qualified toexhort any Rector than any Rector to exhort him.Mr. Owen had no idea that he should die then. In a year or two--when he might die he no doubt intended to die in Newtown. But he never alluded to the possibility of dying. He always acted with such strength of will that he never calculated on any obstacle, and it never occurred to hin that death might interfere with his plans. This was Mr. Dale Owen's impression of his father's feelings. He (Robert Owen) sent Mr. Rigby, to the church of St. Mary's to ascertain the exact spot of is father's grave, but he regarded'these facts as for future use. it was information he wanted. At three oclock on the afternoon before his death,Mr.Owen was laying grand plans for the regeneration of Newtown, and when the Rector called upon him he occupied him with a discussion upon the details, and requested him to be good enough to see the magistrates and other authorities to obtain their co-operation. The day before his decease, his eldest son (the Hon. Robert Dale Owen) arrived at Newtown, accompanied by a lady in whose house Mr. Owen had often been & guest, who rendered to him the last offices of friendship. He called at half-past one at midnight, and asked the time. He probably did not distinctiy hear it, and supposed the replyto be half-past two. Hiseyes were dim then, but fearing his attendants might suffer from loss of rest, he avowed himself to be in no want of anything, and desired them to retire. Of course they were always at hand, and when an hour after he again asked the tine, he was answered half-past two. At the end of a similar period he made a renewed inquiry as to the time, and on being told it was half-past three, his sense of hearing being low, he evidently understood the reply to be half-past two, and he said in his usual smiling way, \\* Why it has been half-past two these three hours.' He thought some friendly imposition was being practised upon him, and he showed his perfect possession of his mind by quietly rebuking it. It was after this, about seven in the morning, as his son held his hand, and a friend stood near him, that he placidly passed away. Death, which commonly beautifes the features, re-imprinted his perennial smile upon his face. His lips appeared as though parting to speak, and he siept the sleep of death' like one whose life had been a victory."

        "text": "Mr. Owen does not appear to have recurred in his last illness to the 'spirits,' with whom he had, according to his own report, for four or five years maintained a friendly and familiar intercourse. \nThe following letter, which appeared in the daily papers, will best tell the story of his last moments. It is from his son, the Hon. R. D. Owen :-- \n“Newtown,Montgomeryshire,Nov.17,1858. \n\\* Mr DeAR SiR, -It is all over. My dear father passed away this morning, at a quarter before seven, and passed away as gently and quietly as if he had been falling asleep.' Thers was not the least struggle, not'a contraction of a limb,or a muscle,not an expression of pain on his face. His breathing gradually became slower and slower, until at last it ceased so imperceptibly,that,even asIheld hishand,I could scarcelytellthe moment when he no longer breathed.Hislast words,distinctly pronounced about twenty minutes before his death,were “Relief has come.\" Abouthalf-anhour before, he said, \" Very easy and comfortable.\" \nFogand frost prevailed everywhere as we set out from London, on Saturday night, November 19th, to attend the funeral at Newtown. Mr. Rigby, the faithful secretary of Mr. Owen, and Mr. Truelove, on the part of the John Street friends, and Mr. Law, were of the party. From twelve to two we were detained at Stafford waiting.By three we were at Shrewsbury. . We went down to the Lion Hotel, to visit the pathway through which our dear old master was last carried. By four o'clock we were on the mail coach, out for a four hours' ride, through Welchpool to Newtown. It was a pleasure to get once more beyond the confines of civilisation, where there were no railroads, and to drive along with smoking horses and blowing bugle, to chat to the guard and treat the coachman, to plunge through the fog, get nipped by the frost-to have insolvent horses mistake a tree for a sheriff's officer, shy into the hedge, and half toss us over--then to draw up under a lamp post and nearly be knocked down, and be knocked up again by a huge mail bag, which the guard threw at you as the best way of getting it on to the coach--then rattling on again, making turnpike keepers start up wildly in their first sleep, run about the road in their shirts to throw open the gates--then dropping small bags of letters on little boys' heads-throwing them over garden walls, and disturbing the whole country as we passed along. The friend who sat by me had a vague notion that he should go head first off,to prevent which he held by the strap that bound the luggage. The guard, to save me from a similar fate, suggested that the said strap should be twisted round me. Disposed to agree to anything, I acquiesced, and in a short time nearly had my head pulled off—for every vibration of the coach, and every clutch of my friend nearly strangled me. When we arrived at an Inn, my friends got out of their cloaks, and I out of my strap, and we plunged about wildly stamping like macadamisers, brushing the frost from our heads, and recovering circulation in noses and toes, lighting cigars against field gates, and imbibing, like true teetotallers, hot ginger beer; but one is bound to confess that the greatest abstainer of the party lost his pledge in the fog, and by the time we got to Welchpool he ordered the first ‘ brandy hot, which it is also true that he never got, for his companions had drank up all the scanty glasses the landlady had left out for the morning coach."

The whole land seemed sacred where he lay. Wales, as far as one could see in the night, posseses a foliage more graceful than England. English trees wear an irregular, spasmodic Outline, as though they had met with opposition in growing, and were savage at it; while the Welch trees were round or slim, tall or diffusive, with more proportion and grace, as though they were there of their own accord, and were glad of it. This may be fancy, but fancy to a traveller is sister of fact, and often delights him more. At last, houses came in sight--old gables projected—- hills overshadowedthe Severn was running by--now we are amid low streets--now over abridge—now we turn a corner by the cross—there, that plain, pleasant-looking housea stationer's shop at the very end of the chief street, Bridge Street—there, that is where Mr. Owen was born!

        "text": "·Robert Owen, of New Lanark. Born, May 14, 1771, Died, November 17, 1858.' \nIn accordance with the presumed wish of Mr. Owen, everything was done unostertatiously, and as inexpensively as posible  He desired to set an example of simple and costless taste in all things. Mr. Thomas, who kindly and effciently superintended the public arrangements, adopted the principle of associating the aged as far as possible in the funeral, connecting Mr. Owen with the earliest associations in Newtown. The oldest inhabitants, equal tothe task, bore the bier.Three of his schoolfellows or playmates were discovered to be living; one, Mr.William Williams, the father of the post mistress of Newtown, died a day or two after Mr. Owen.  Two old gentlemen, with tottering steps, walked in the procession, dim of sight, and hard of hearing. It was very touching to see them guided along in a ceremony which must soon attend themselves. The chief shops of the town put up shutters out of respect to their eminent townsman, who had come to die among them. But for my brother's marriage taking,place at Fleet Street on Saturday, we should have done the same there. On Monday, however, the day of the burial, I ordered the house closed. On the day of the burial, Mr. Robert Cooper arrived, though the day before it had fallen to him to attend the same sad offces for his own mother. Colonel Clinton had arrived from Royston, Mr. W. H. Ashurst from London, Mr. and Mrs. Francis Pears from London,and Mr.Thomas Allsopfromthe Den,Teignmouth. Mr. W. Cox and Mr. Pare were already there. When the procession left the Cross all business was suspended, the streets were crowded, windows, housetops, road-side elevations, contained curious watchersold people especially peered with reverential gaze uponthe bier.Odd looking windows in gable-looking houses, in high ways and narrow streets, that seemed not to have been open for ages, were thrown wide now, and young girls and children crowded to see the memorable sight. The medical and clerical professions, gentlemen and manufacturers of the town, joined in the procession. It first went to St. David's, the new church, where the Rev. Mr. Edwards, M.A., offciated, Mr. A. A. Evans played the Dead March in Saul, very effectively, as the procession left the church, and we proceeded to St. Mary’s, an old Saxon church, now in ruins, standing in a romantic spot. It is said to be a structure of the ninth century., The tower has been standing nearly a thousand years. The old bells peal as clearly now as when Harold was king.How one would like to be'able to converse with the early ringers! The body of the church is now in ruins. The windows are gone, the roof is dropping in, the gallery is dipping. A noble willow, planted from the slip brought from the famous one over Napoleon's tomb at St. Helena, grows under the shadow of the tower. Near to that spot we laid Mir. Owen in his parents\" grave, The enclosure of the churchyard had fallen into decay, and an inhabitant of Newtown, who returned from Australia with a little wealth, gave f50 to build new walls."

        "text": "But the walls want suitable gates, and Mr. Dale Owen has presented a new pair of iron ones.The Severn runs by the side of the churchyard, and near to Mr. Owen's Grave are two small grave stones, one in the form of a heart, bearing the initials R. O. (Richard Owen); another stone near it is in the form of a diamond, bearing the initials J. L. (Jane Lewis.)  Richard Owen was a distant relative of our Mr. Owen. Richard and Jane Lewis were lovers, whose parents forbade their union, and they went to the opposite side of the Severn, and on the bank, in sight of their graves, poisoned themselves. The inhabitants erected a bower over their graves, connecting both. And here the poor mother of Richard Owen used to come_and sit and knit all the day through, and often, _as the sextoness told us, her father, who was sexton in her youth, had at twelve o'clock at night to induce the old lady to return'toherhome. She sleepsnowby the sideofher child. 'This bower of so many sad and moving memories had fallen into decay. _ Mr. Dale Owen, with that graceful feeling by which his father was distinguished,has ordered this bower to be restored. \nThere in the old churchyard, under the ancient tower, where the glorious Severn ripples, we buried Mr. Owen. All was solemn, and touching,_and graceful, except the ceremony. _Never did the church service, that stereotyped, and, in parts, painful ritual, sound more harshly than over the pure old man. Mr. Allsop, who would have walked from Devonshire, had it been necessary, to be present at the grave, would not enter the church. He preferred the solitude of nature, where the reverence of the heart was undisturbed by hollow formularies. On arriving in the town he addressed to me the letter I shall here Yuote :-- \n\\*Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Nov.22, 1858. \n‘My DEAR FRIEND,—The grave has closed on Robert Owen (if great aims and a blameless life constitute greatness and goodness)-a great and pre-eminently good man-and what a worker! For seventy years, since the year 1788, when my informant saw him rolling up a piece of silk very. neatly, and with his mind ever absorbed upon the great problem of humanity, he has never passed one hour in idleness, one hour not devoted to the deliverance of his fellow-man from the degradation of superstition, and the tyranny of class and capital. \n‘Itpained me deeply that such a man,after lifehad departed,should pass into,or rather under,themummery of an outworn creed,which it had been the great labour of his life to expose and destroy. What hope can we rationallyentertainofthefuture,whenthefollowersofRobertOwenendure Christianburialfor theirmaster,whose chief meritwas his exposure of the system of priestcraft and superstition? Why, the very Indians throughout Central America and Mexico,have recently rejected their mystery men, having detected them in their frauds, whilst our mystery men are accepted “by a most thinking people,” to use Cobbett's expression, as of divine appointment, and their existing revelation as the perfection of reason.It is not by this weak conformity to the absurd practices enjoined byour superstition, that any progress is to be hoped for. \n‘It was not thus that George Fox obtained for the Quakers full recognition of their independence,it was not by such means that Cromwell, Ludlow, and Ireton succeeded. $\\mathrm{\\Delta}$ for onehourof thattrueman,fanatic though he was, and his Ironsides,to show thic mcn of this age of what stuf the men were made who withstood tyranny and priestcraft in the olden time. In this time of cant and profession, where every man is liberalGod save the mark! in profession; where are the men who bear witness to the truths which are known--\" familiar as Household Words?”Where are the men who,despising the opinion of others,or what is said to be opinion,who bear witness to their conviction?What men,out of the myriads who laugh at the superstitions rampant throughout the world, show their sense and appreciation of truth by refusing to serve or invoke a Deity, of whose existence they have no evidence? Forif a Being, such as he is described, did exist, he should be superseded. Where the men that refuse any longer to perpetuate that horrid system of punishing men for crimes which that system has rendered inevitable, and from which they cannotescape?"

Alas for an age and a people who seem determined that custom shall be fruitful and reason barren. Who can hope for a pureri uner life, or any real devotion?—Ever yours, \nT. ALLSOP. \nLet us hope that men of the true mould yet live. We believe they do. Is not the writer of this letter one ? But there was a difficulty in the case.  As Mr. Owen appeared to wish to lie in the grave of his ancestors, the wish was sacred, and was to be complied with-and as they lay in consecrated ground, the church had dominion there. The Rector declined to allow friends to speak at the grave.The ceremony of the church could, as in the case of Richard Carlile, be forced upon the dead. To have protested against it, as Mr. Carlile's eldest son did, would have produced a scene. This would be undesirable, Mr. Owen's life had been peace and good will.Better ten Popes officiated at his grave, than disturb his funeral by a broil. Had I had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Robert Dale Owen intimately (I never met him until my arrival in Newtown), I would have suggested that, since a clergyman was inevitable, that we ask the Archbishop of Dublin, whose noble friendship for Blanco White makes his memory reverential-or Maurice, or Kingsley, some priest whose large sympathy with mankind places him on a level with Mr. Owen, or whose genius would sanctifyhis service—from suchlips I could have bowedwithout pain before the offces of the church. The Rev. Mr. Edwards, who'did oficiate, I met at the public breakfast, I walked from the church in conversation with him, I spent some time with him at Mr. Thomas's house in the evening, and frankly own that his conduct was very graceful throughout. He kept, with'the good taste of an educated gentleman, from making any one conscious of his professional position, and we all owe him esteem for his bearing. Yet it is justice to ourselves to own our sentiments, and to vindicate them. \nThe churchyard was crowded.Even the windows of the ruined church were thronged. In one window Mr. Allsop observed an elfish old woman, holding, up two elfn children, black-eyed, wild, and picturesque. The whole scene, daguerreotyped, would have been striking. Next to the old men, who stood around, the prettiest feature was the procession of young children whom Mr. Owen, living, delighted to have around him. The little band stood there at the grave of the old man who brought so many blessings upon childhood."

        "text": "For once, I confess, bigotry would have been a blessing. _How I prayed that the clergy would do by Mr. Owen as they did by Voltaire and’ Paine, refuse him the rites of Christian burial.\\* Then we would have performed the last offices of humanity in our own way. Had they refused him a grave, we would have borne the old man away, and have laid him among his own people. Multitudes would have awaited the arrival of his remains at Euston Station, and we would have buried him in the presence of his disciples in London. \nReporting over, and a hasty dinner, I proceeded to the grave to relieve Mr. Rigby, who, for reasons we had, remained in the churchyard when all had left.' The solitude of the old man's grave, as I groped my way to it in the dense fog, brought back, in a flood, all the bright recollections of his busy life-so closed. Later, Mr. Pare and Mr. Allsop joined me. By the fitful light the workmen had there, I gathered some of the ashes of Mr. Owen's ancestors, and preserved them for an urn to be kept at Fleet Street. Early next morning, I, Mr. Pare, and Mr. Allsop were the first pilgrims to the grave. One relic of the dead, which the frost-hardened earth did not enable one to entomb, was gathered to be preserved with the ashes, lest some sacrilegious foot should trample upon it. In the dim light of the breaking day we took fareweli of that spot to which many a traveller in time to come will turn. \nNewtown Hall, the residence of Dr. Slyman, Mr. Owen's last physician, is a delightful mansion, situated in a kind of park. It was formerly the residence of Sir JohnPowell Price.Intheoldtime Charles the First had shelter there.In Mr. Owen's youth it was a school, and there he received his education. Mr. Owen's birth-place is a good and agreeable house ; very old. Its polished oaken foors are as firm now as ever.The room in which he was born is one of the pleasantest cosiest little rooms imaginable—just theroom inwhich onewould like to be born, if one could be consulted before-hand in the matter. The deed conveying the house to Richard Owen, Robert Owen's father, bears a transfer by the well-known ^ Abraham Newland, on the part of the Bank of England--and I discovered one party to the deed bore the name of Lloyd Jones, no relative, of course, of him whose name Mr. Owen's friends know. \nIn dense fog and biting frost we again took our places on the coach top for Shrewsbury. Mr. Allsop sat on the front box, Mr. Pare and I behind him. That was a glorious journey, not soon to be forgotten. Mr. Pare, one of Mr. Owen's literary executors, always various and eloquent on the theme of his great master's character, and Mr. Allsop, recalled golden memories of the old time and the old heroes. Never, too, had winter so many wonders in my eyes. A thick silvery rime covered all visible nature.  The very hedges shone as though embossed with all the richness of Italian art. Trees and shrubs and sprays hung in every variety of beauty. The deep fog shut out all beyond the road-side trees, which came in sight one by one, wth a new mystery of loveliness.The dense haze seemed like some spirit of the woods, holding up her beautiful children to our gaze. Each tree stood out in its bright and sparkling glory, like a bride-our whole ride was through an endless procession of them. When Shrewsbury Castle came at length in sight, I was sorry for the first time in my life to come in sight of a castle. We had ieft the dreamland of poetry and death behind us. The busy world and its recurring struggles were nowbefore us-—andwe entered it with sad hearts."

        "text": "ORATION ON THE DEATH OF MR. OWEN.t \nDelivered in the Public Hall, Rochdale.-Jacob Bright, J.P., intheChair. \nWHEN military and spiritual heroes die, their deeds and deserts are emblazoned in the popular memory. Parliamentary grants, biographies, and mausoleums render them substantial tributes. When the soldier dies in a just cause, or the saint departs who has displayed human virtues, men begrudge them neither honour nor renown. We here, however,record the history of one who was neither soldier nor saint --who yet fought like a warrior in a holy cause, and who did more for humanity than any general or any saint during the two generations in which he lived. Has the world a spare hour to devote to the memory of one whose profession was humanity, and whose daily study was the social welfare of the common people? \nIt is a reproach brought against the working ciass, that they are ungrateful to those whohave served them;that they receive benefits without troubling themselves to ask to whom they owe them ; that their prejudices do not prevent them taking what they can get, but that their prejudices prevent them acknowledging their benefactors; that they suffer them to die from among them, and render them no honour and no thanks. We meet to-night to remove that stigma as far aswe are eoncerned. \nA great publicist has died-—Robert Owen. Death, the warder of the unknown world, has admitted through his mysterious portals no greater friend of the people, than Robert Owen. Foraperiod extending back to the end of the last .century,,Mr. ‘Owen wasastandard-bearer_of advanced opinions. Childrenowe him thanks, for he founded infant schools; Dutch paupers owe him thanks, for he drew up the plan which secured them independence ; workmen owe him thanks, for he set the example of shorter hours of labour; Prussia owes him thanks, for he was the author of their national system of education; Trades Unionists owe him thanks, for he headed their vast and perilous deputation to Lord Melbourne, on behalf of the Dorchester labourers; Politicians who believe in progress"

There has been no public man in this century so true a publicist as Mr. Owen. He took a wise and wide interest in the welfare of the people, beyond any other leader of opinion. He had no contemporary, and he leaves no? successor. The poor man, read in the history of his own order, may say of the death of Mr.Owen,with much more truth than Sir Walter Scott said of Pitt, or Gladstone of Peel-- \nNow is the stately column broke; The beacon light is quenched in smoke; The trumpet's silvery voice is still; The warder's silent on the hill.' \n时\n\nThere was a certain newness about Mr. Owen which is singular. He was born at Newtown, he first became distinguished at New Lanark, he then established \\*New Harmony,' in Indiana, afterwards the \\*New Moral World,' he was the author of \\* New Views, he proposed a \\* New State of Society, and one of his latest publications was the\\*New Existence of Man upon Earth,'and he had, as we all know, a freshness and newness of spirit which often shamed young men, and surprised the old. Though I had the privilege of knowing Mr. Owen twenty years, and of having my attention professionally drawn to his views, I do not assume myseif to be capable of giving an adequate estimate of his character or services. I pretend to express only my own conception of them.There are few men living who know the whole compass of his career--who have read all his speeches-all his writings-all his remarkable correspondence; who have  perused the newspaper comments upon his_proceedings, during the last ffty years of his public agitations.  I' know few who have done so, and without doing this no one can fully appreciate the nature or extent of the iniluence he has exercised. Not only England, but America, London, and the capitals and courts of every nation in' Europe, have, at one time or other, resounded with his name. Emperors have been his guests, kings his listeners, princes his friends, statesmen his correspondents, philosophers his partners._ The foremost men of the past age turned to him for inspiration; rulers waited upon his words, and the peoples of two worlds once believed in him as a deliverer.A man must have native force of character who achieves this.It is not a well-meaning man of mere feeble philanthropy, but a man of ability, of feeling, and of truth. to whom we pav the tribute of our respect to-night. \nTo Mr. Owen's memory I offer homage, but it is tho homage of discrimination.That is the manliest reverence which praises within the limits of truth.I hate the flatterer.Either he is a knave who intends to impose upon me, or a patron who intends to befool me, or a coward who applauds because he has not the courage to condemn, or a weak-eyed man who can only see one thing at a time. I hate the men who, by wholesale praise, hide from me what I should be, and keep me what I am.I prefer the man who blows hot and cold to him who blows all hot, because I want to be invigorated, not to be stifled. This sentiment will rule all I say. I stand here to honour him of whom I speak, by frankness as well as praise, and not to pour hollow complimentsinto the‘dull coldear of death."

        "text": "Robert Owen, like Thomas Paine, was endowed with great natural capacity for understanding public affairs. He was accustomed to give practical and notable opinions upon public questions, quite apart from his own doctrines; and his society was sought as that of a man who had the key of many State diffculties.Those know little of him who suppose that he owed his distinction wholly to his riches. A manmust be wise as well as wealthy, to achieve the illustrious friendships which marked his career. He had personally an air of natural nobility about him. He had, as the Daily Neus says, ' an instinct to rule and command.' I only knew him late in life, when age had impressed measure upon his steps and deliberateness on his speech. When he had the vivacity of youth and middle age, he must have been an actor on the political stage cf nomean mark. He always spoke as ‘one having authority.' He had a voice of great compass, thorough self-possession, and becomingaction. Like many other men, he spoke much better than he wrote. Only two or three years ago, at a private dinner, arrangedthatMr.JosephBarkermight beintroduced tohim,therewere Eeveral University men, and authors of some note, present. Mr. Owen's conversation was' the most brilliant of all the company. On the last occasion on which he presided in public was when he made the presentation of a purse to his faithful attendant Mr. Rigby..The patrician manner in which he spoke of his old friend, the dignity without haughtiness, the kindness without condescension, I never saw equalled. It was a relic of the old manner, which I have seen alleged in romance, as the characteristic of the princely employer, but which I never witnessed before. The meeting was like a reception byTalleyrand. \nMr. Owen's speeches had vivacity and humour. His writings have little of either.  His best book, and the one that made his reputation, his‘Essays on the Formation of Character,' Francis Place revised for him. Mr. Owen ought always to have put his manuscripts into the hands of others. He had noble thoughts, but when he took his pen in hand he fell into principle spinning, which is always duller reading than the Fifth Book of Euclid.It is very true and very important, but it bores you. However, his Life of'himselfhis last work and most interesting of all-contains more personal facts of interest and importance than any political biography which has appeared in our time. \nThe impression Mr. Owen made upon workmen of the last generation is best described by one whose name is an honour to that order I mean Ebenezer Elliott. In an address sent by Trades Unionists of Sheffield in 1834, Elliott says--^ You came among us as a rich man among the poor, and did not call us a rabble. This is a phenomenon new to us.  There was no sneer on your lips, no covert scorn in your tone."

        "text": "These words show us how working men were treated some thirty years ago.It was in reply to this address that Mr. Owen made a remark which is_an axiom in the best political liberalism of these days; he said · Injustice is a great mistake.\\* It is not merely wrong, wicked, malevolent, hateful'; it won't answer, it won't pay. It is a blunder, it is a disgrace as well as a crime. \nMr. Owen was an apostle, not a rhetorician. He never looked all round his statements (as Mr. Bright now does) to see where the enemy could come up and pervert them.He said‘man was the creature of circumstances’ for thirty years, before he added the important words acting previous to and after his birth.He had the fatal ideas of the New Testament, that equality was to be attained by granting to a_community ‘all things in common'-at the commencement. Whereas this is the result, not the beginning. You must begin with inequality and authority, steering steadily towards self-government and’ the accumulation of the common gains, until independence is secured to all. Mr. Owen looked upon men through the spectacles of his own good nature. He never took Lord Brougham's advice \\* to pick his men.' He never acted on the maxim that the working class are as jealous of each other as the upper classes are of them. Alil that he did as amanufacturer he omitted to'do as a Founder of Communities. As a manufacturer, even Allen, his eminent Quaker partner, wrote to him, \\* Robert Owen, thou makest a bargain in a masterly manner !' Dr. Bowring allowed that the only time Jeremy Bentham ever made money, was when he was a partner of Mr. Owen. In after life Mr. Owen was really reckless of his own fame.No leader ever took so little care in guarding his own reputation. He lent his name to schemes_which were not his. The failure of Queenwood was_not ascribable to him.When his advice was not followed, he would say Well, gentlermen, I tell you what you ought to do. You differ from me. We will not quarrel. Carry out your own plans. Experience will show you who is right ?' Then failure came, for which he was not responsible, but it was ascribed to him._ The public knew nothing of Executives which he withdrew from.  They only knew Robert Owen, and whatever failed under his name,they infered failed through him. Mr. Owen was a general who never provided himself witha rear guard. While he was fighting in the front ranks, priests might come up and cut off his commissariat._ His own troops fell into pits against which he had warned them. Yet he would write his next dispatch without it occurring to him to mention his own defeat, and he would return to his camp without missing his army. \nMr. Owen's fault was that he was always playing at world making --no, I retract that word. I will not say \\*playing'-he was too earnest a man for that--but he was always dreaming of world making. Now, to sweep the world clean and begin again is a rather extensive undertaking. It would be a great interruption to business. And it is diffcult to pack up the human race and put them out of the way, while the world is being cleared. So the world objected to the operation, and Mr. Owen never had his way. Butletus not be too hasty to_condemn Mr. Owen for this idea. Hewas a young_ man and had commenced as a theorist when the first French Revolution broke out.He saw France and America both make the attempt of reconstituting society. Things were so bad, politically and religiously, that nobody had any hope and little chance of amending them.. Many men besides Mr. Owen thought it better to begin again. When Pope, the poet, who suffered from great constitutional debility, stumbled, and nearly fell as he was getting into a boat, he exclaimed, by way of apology to the waterman-\\*God mend me!' \\*I think, sir, answered the waterman, God had better make a new one!’This was the opinion of most political Reformers when Mr. Owen was young. Their only hope was in a new state of society. Even the present Queen's father^said, when introducing Mr. Owen to a public meeting in the Freemason's Hall, London, so late as 1819 -\\* It may be doubted whether the permanent safety of the British Empire does not depend upon the measures which may be speedily adopted to ameliorate the condition of theworkingclasses,and these measures he called upon Mr. Owen to explain."

        "text": "It is difficult to judge yet the great act of Mr. Owen in ‘ denouncing all the religions of the world, as he did in the City of London Tavern in 1817. It was part of his plan.It was a deliberate act. He toid his religious partner, Mr. Allen, the Quaker, that he would do so two years before.This act arrested the acceptance of his social system. From being a Social Reformer, Mr Owen commenced to be a Religious Reformer, and, being a thorough man, he did by the Church as he did by the State—he proposed to reform it altogether.For this work, Mr. Owen appears to me to have made no adequate preparation. He followedthe instinct of hisconscience without calculation.The ominous meeting in the Rotunda of Dublin in 1823, sealed the fate of his Social Reform, and condemned his schemes ever after to the hands of the minority. The great powers of society set their faces against him, and the_people were too_ poor to carry his ideas out. The greatestperson of distinctionwhobest understood $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{r}_{\\varepsilon}$ Owen,and who did not desert him on account of his irreligious views, was the Queen's father, to whom we have before referred.He said at one of Mr. Owen's meetings, two years after he had denounced all religions, \\*If I understand Mr. Owen's principles, they lead him not to interfere to the injury of any sect ; but he claims for himself that which he is so desirous to obtain for his fellow creatures—\"religious liberty and freedom of conscience'-and this he contends for, because his experience compelshim to conclude that these principles are now necessary to secure the well-being and good order of society. This is excellently put, and is really all Mr. Owen meant. Being always a Theist, he was logically"
