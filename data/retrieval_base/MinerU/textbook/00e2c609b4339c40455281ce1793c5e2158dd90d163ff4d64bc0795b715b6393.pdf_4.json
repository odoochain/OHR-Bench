Despite a merger between Kluwer and Reed-Elsevier being called off in the facc of growing attention from antitrust agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, smaller, quietermergers have proceeded toward the same end unnoticed.Large commercial publishers are steadily absorbing smaller publishers whose journals can round outtheirofferingsandhelpthem achieve brand identity, or critical mass, in specialty areas.In 1998 alone,Kluweracquired Waverly/Williams& Wilkins,Plenum,and Ovid Technologies;Taylor & Francis acquired Routledge and Carfax; Harcourt/Academic Press acquired Mosby; Bertelsmann, a large entertainment conglomcrate, acquired Springer Verlag; and Elsevier Science acquired six publishers, including JAI Press,BioMedNet,and Beilstein. Smaller publishers undoubtedly see these mergers as opportunities to get their titles into the electronic mainstream.For library customers, this trend represents a loss of competition, which docs not bode well for prices. \n# \nIn response, libraries, universities, and learned societies are beginning to experiment with creating critical mass of their own to challenge commercial publishers and drive prices down. Two such experiments are drawing attention. SPARC, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition founded by the Association of Research Libraries, uses funds pledged by its members to subsidize and support publishers whose e-journals can go head-to-hcad with very costly commercial journals but at lower subscription rates. SPARC has successfully launched electronic journalsfromtwowell-knownchemical societies and a group of distinguished ecologists. (For more on SPARC, see Ken Frazier's \"Liberating Scholarship, LJ10/15/98,p.40-41.â€”Ed.) \n\nHighWire Press  was begunby StanfordUniversity Libraryin1997 to assist society publishers in getting their journals online.Withmore than 100 titles now among its offerings and with growing markets in the United States and abroad,HighWire is challenging the assumption that full-featured web journals have to come from commercial STM publishers. These library-driven strategies, like the ones of the commercial publishers, are fueled by hopes of shaping future markets in their favor. \n# \nPublishers and vendors have taken a hit from the economic crises in Asia and in Latin America.Reacting to the threat of significant cancellations in many Asian countries and in Brazil, some publishers attempted to protect their subscription base in these countries by extending credit directly to customers and/or to their agents tokeep them from canceling titles. Othcr publishcrs dccided to accept the cancellations and reduce their exposure to losses from bad credit. In the midst of the dilenima are agents, whose profits have also been affected by libraries that could not pay. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\n\\multicolumn{8}{l}{TABLE 6:2000C0STPR0JECTI0NSBYBR0AD SUBJECT} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{8}{l}{Projected Projected Projected No.of %of 6661 %f %f 2000 %of} \\\\\nCitation index & Titles List & Cost & Cost & increase & Cost & Cost & Overali% Increase \\\\\nARTS\\&HUMANITIES &  &  &  & 9 \\\\\nU.S NON-U.S. & 701 703 & 49.9 $90,869 50.1 165,327 & 35.5 64.5 & 8 & $99.047 178,553 & 35.7 64.3 & 8.4 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{8}{l}{} \\\\\nSOCIALSCIENCES &  &  & 32.9 & 11 \\\\\nU.S. & 1,369 51.8 & $400,921 818,099 & 67.1 & 9 & $445,022 891,728 & 33.3 66.7 & 9.7 \\\\\nNON-U.S. & 1,272 & 48.2 \\\\\nSCIENCE &  &  &  & 29.7 & 11.5 \\\\\nU.S. & 1,196 1,749 & 40.6 59.4 & $787,959 1,863,324 & 70.3 & 8.5 & $878,574 2,021,707 & 30.3 9.4 69.7 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nPROJECTEDOVERALLINCREASEFORALLISI TIALESO4% \n\nOn the positive side, the advent of the long-awaited Euro should have a stabilizing effect on periodical pricing, particularly for libraries in European countries,in that costs should become more transparent with fewer cross-border currency exchanges.
