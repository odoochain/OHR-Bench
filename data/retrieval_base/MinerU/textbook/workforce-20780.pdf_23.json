It includes: capabilities, routines, methods, procedures and methodologies embedded in organization.Structural capital is the supportive non-physical infrastructure that enables human capital tofunction. \nRelational capital,consistingof suchelements ascustomerrelationships,supplierrelationships,trademarks and tradenames (whichhavevalue onlybyvirtueofcustomerrelationships)licenses,andfranchises.Thenotion thatcustomer capitalisseparate from human and structural capital indicates its central importance to an organization's worth. The value of the relationships a business maintains with its customers and suppliers is also referred as goodwill, but often poorly booked in corporate accounts, becauseofaccountingrules. \n# \nWoolcock(2001) defined social capital as thestocks of social trust,norms and networks that people access to solve joint problems. Interrelationships and connectivity between humans are central to theformation of social capital, hencewhy it is often described as theglue that holds society together(Murphy,200 source 4).Inrecent years,drivenbyfears overfragmentation of communities and a generalized decline in civic engagement (Foley et al.,2011) social capital has moved up the political agenda in democratic societies. It is, however, a complicated and contested concept with differing interpretations of its meaning and usefulness (Quinn, 2013). \nColeman (1998) defines social capital by its functions and views it as a resource that can be drawn upon collectively.Its presence encourages certain actions,whichfacilitate theaccomplishment of mutuallybeneficial ends.Moreover,\"social capitalinthefamily and community play a crucial role in creating human capital(defined as individual skills and abilities in the next generation).Like Coleman,Bourdieu (1985)presents a sociological view of social capital, but he views it primarily as a resource forindividuals.He defined social capital as'the aggregate of the actual or potential resources, which are linked to possession of a durable network of more orlessinstitutionalizedrelationships of mutualacquaintance andrecognition'(Bourdieu,1985p248). \nLike Coleman (1998),Putnam (1995) underlines the collective dimensions of social capital, defining it as \"features of social organization such as networks,norms and social trust that facilitate co-ordination and cooperation for mutual benefit'. Putnam (1993)argued that thequality of lifein societies and their economic sustainabilitywas directly atributableto thefeatures of social organization.He suggested that the hallmarks of a successful society depended upon core attributes of human relationships, the presence or absence of trust,the expectation of reciprocity and the existence of networks.A basic premise underpinning the work of these three theorists,and indeed social capitaltheoryingeneral,is that investment insocialrelationsisexpected toyieldawhole seriesofreturnsinthemarketplaceandbeyond. \n# \nA distinction between bonding (exclusive) and bridging (inclusive)forms of social capital is widely made in the literature.Putnam {1993)explains thatbondingsocialcapitalisinwardlookingandcharacterizedbystrongtiesthatreinforce exclusive identities, promote homogeneity and create strong in-group loyalty; whereas bridging social capital is outward looking, involves weaker ties and promotes links between diverse individuals and groups. Putnam suggests that many groups simultaneously bond across some social dimensions and bridge across others.In general,the dominant sense is that social capital is a force for good.However,Leonard (2004) has problematized the fact that policy-makers,seeing how social capital can potentially be converted into otherforms of capital,often consider it asa quick-fix solutionto complex,long-term structural problems.Indeed, viewing social capital as a 'quick-fix' and a panacea for all social ills is a noted criticism levelled at social capital theorists. Putnam'swork in particularhas been criticizedfor romanticizing'theworldwehavelost'and ignoring the downside of community life. \nOvertime, the growing social capital literature has developed a more critical lens,which acknowledge the inadequacies of the basic frameworkwithout abandoning the concept altogether(Muir 20 source10}.For example,in their critique of Putnam'swork,Portes and Landolt (1996) discuss how in, some cases, social capital can constrain individuals' actions and choices. This is because while social capital can promote accesstoresources,it can equally deny or limit such access."
