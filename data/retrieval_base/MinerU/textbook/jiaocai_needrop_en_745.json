        "text": "Let $a_{n}=f^{(n)}(a)/n!$ , so that for any $a$ wehave $\\left|a_{n}\\right|>n^{n}$ . By Hadamard's formula, the radius of convergence is given by \n$$\n{\\frac{1}{R}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{n\\to\\infty}\\operatorname*{sup}_{n=\\infty}\n$$\nso that thepower series defined in therighthand sideisvalid only at $a$ Yet,as an analytic function it should be analytic in some radius of convergence for $R>0$ Of course,if $g(n)$ is any increasing function (instead of $n^{n}$ )suchthat $g(n)\\to\\infty$ , then we arrive at the same conclusion. \nHere's another way to go about the problem, which seems to be more of what Ahlfors intended by putting this problem here. Cauchy's estimate tells us that if $R>0$ \n$$\n|f^{(n)}(z)|\\leq{\\frac{n!M}{R^{n}}}\n$$\nwhere $M=\\operatorname*{max}_{|z|=R}{\\big|}f(z){\\big|}$ . Note that $M$ is finite since $f(z)$ is continuous and $|z|=R$ is compact. If also $|f^{(n)}(z)|>n!n^{n}$ ,then $n^{n}\\leq M/R^{n}$ for all $n\\geq0$ For $_n$ large enough this inequality fails, since we can rearrange it to $(n R)^{n}\\leq M$ ,and the left hand side is unbounded for every $R>0$ \n4.2.3.6.A more general form of Lemma 3 reads as follows: \nLet the function $\\varphi(z,t)$ be continuous as a function of both variables when $\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{z}}$ lies in a region $\\Omega$ and $a\\leq t\\leq b$ .Suppose further that $\\varphi(z,t)$ is analytic as a function of $z\\in\\Omega$ for any fixed $t$ .Then \n$$\nF(z)=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\varphi(z,t)\\mathop{}{d{t}}\n$$\nis analytic in $z$ and \n$$\nF^{\\prime}(z)=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\frac{\\partial\\varphi(z,t)}{\\partial z}~d t~(\\star).\n$$\nTo prove this represent $\\varphi(z,t)$ as a Cauchy integral \n$$\n\\varphi(z,t)={\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{C}{\\frac{\\varphi(\\zeta,t)}{\\zeta-z}}d\\zeta.\n$$\nFill in the necessary details to obtain \n$$\nF(z)=\\int_{C}\\left({\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\varphi(\\zeta,t)~d t\\right){\\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta-z}}.\n$$\nand use Lemma 3 to prove $(\\star)$ \nSolution: Recall that Cauchy's integral formula tells us that \n$$\nf(z)={\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{C}{\\frac{f(\\zeta)~d\\zeta}{\\zeta-z}}\n$$\nfor $z$ in the bounded region determined by $C$ .Applying this with $F(z)$ gives \n$$\nF(z)={\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{C}{\\frac{F(\\zeta)d\\zeta}{\\zeta-z}}={\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{C}\\left(\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\varphi(\\zeta,t)d t\\right){\\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta-z}}=\\int_{C}\\left({\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\varphi(\\zeta,t)d t\\right){\\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta-z}}\n$$\n(one may also view it as a consequence of Fubini's theorem). Defining $\\Phi(\\zeta)=1/2\\pi i\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\varphi(\\zeta,t)~d\\cdotp$ Lemma3tells us that \n$$\nF^{\\prime}(z)=\\int_{C}{\\frac{\\Phi(\\zeta)d\\zeta}{(\\zeta-z)^{2}}}=\\int_{C}\\left({\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}}\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\varphi(\\zeta,t)d t\\right){\\frac{d\\zeta}{(\\zeta-z)^{2}}}.\n$$\nNow apply Lemma 3 once more to $\\varphi(z,t)$ directly: \n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\varphi(z,t)}{\\partial z}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}\\frac{\\varphi(\\zeta,t)~d\\zeta}{(\\zeta-z)^{2}}.\n$$\nIntegrating this over $\\alpha\\leq t\\leq\\beta$ and using Fubini's theorem to switch integrals gives the result. \n4.3.LocalProperties of Analytical Functions."
