But Theorem 4.2(c) tells us that since the 7 points of $X$ are in linearly general position the CastelnuovoMumford regularity of $S_{X}$ (defined in Chapter 4) is 2, or equivalently, that the Betti diagram of $S_{X}$ fits into 3 rows. Moreover, the ring $S_{X}$ is reduced and of dimension 1 so it has depth 1. The Auslander-Buchsbaum Formula A2.15 shows that the resolution will have length 3. Putting this together, and using Corollary 1.9 we see that the minimal free resolution of $S_{X}$ must have Betti diagram of the form \n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{\\boxed{0}}}&{{1}}&{{2}}&{{3}}\\ {{0}}&{{1}}&{{\\boxed{-}}}&{{-}}\\ {{1}}&{{\\boxed{-}}}&{{\\beta_{2,3}}}&{{\\beta_{3,4}}}\\ {{2}}&{{\\boxed{-}}}&{{\\beta_{1,3}}}&{{\\beta_{2,4}}}&{{\\beta_{3,5}}}\\end{array}}}\\end{array}\n$$\nwherethe $\\beta_{i,j}$ that are not shown are zero. In particular, the ideal of $X$ is generated by quadrics and cubics. \nUsing Corollary 1.10 we compute successively $\\beta_{1,2}=3$ $\\beta_{1,3}-\\beta_{2,3}=1$ $\\beta_{2,4}-$ $\\beta_{3,4}=6$ $\\beta_{3,5}=3$ , and the Betti diagram has the form \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n & 0 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 一 & 一 & 一 \\\\\n1 & 3 & β2,3 & β3,4 \\\\\n2 & 1+β2.3 一 & 6+β3,4 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(This is the same diagram as at the end of the previous section. Here is the connection: Extending the ground field if necessary to make it infinite, we could use Lemma A2.3 and choose a linear form $x\\in S$ thatis anonzerodivisor on $S_{X}$ By Lemma 3.15 the graded Betti numbers of $S_{X}/x S_{X}$ as an $S/x S$ -module are the same as those of $S_{X}$ as an $S$ -module. Using our knowledge of the Hilbert function of $S_{X}$ and the exactness of the sequence \n$$\n0\\longrightarrow S_{X}(-1)\\stackrel{x}{\\longrightarrow}S_{X}\\longrightarrow S_{X}/x S_{x}\\longrightarrow0,\n$$\nwe see that the cyclic $(S/x S)$ -module $S_{X}/x S_{x}$ has Hilbert function with values $1,3,3$ . This is what we used in Section 2B.) \n# \nWe see that even in this simple case the Hilbert function does not determine the $\\beta_{i,j}$ ,and indeed they can take different values. It turns out that the difference refects a fundamental geometric distinction between different sets $X$ of7points in linearly general position in $\\mathbb{P}^{3}$ ：whetherornot $X$ lies on a curve of degree 3. \nUp to linear automorphisms of $\\mathbb{P}^{3}$ there is only one irreducible curve of degree 3 not contained in a plane. This twisted cubic is one of the rational normal curves studied in Chapter 6. Any 6 points in linearly general position in $\\mathbb{P}^{3}$ lie"
