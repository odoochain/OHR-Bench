        "text": "# \nTo better understand John Dunham & Associates (JDA), look no further than American economist Leonard E. Read’s famous 1958 essay I, Pencil. The essay highlights the complex process involved in creating a simple pencil. Comprised of wood, lacquer, a printed label, graphite lead, a bit of metal, and an eraser, millions of people from around the world have a hand in making a pencil. \nAt JDA, we develop and help tell similar stories about our clients’ industries. We support these stories with economic data. Every industry, company or product has a story to tell. We start with the data, which we obtain from both industry and government sources. Using widely accepted modeling techniques, we take that data and calculate the economic story of an entire industry. \nTRUE ASSESSMENT OF MARKET SIZE \nThe end result is a comprehensive economic impact study that details direct, indirect and induced employment, as well as wage and economic output data by state. Data can be further broken out by legislative districts or geographic area using our proprietary models. Finally, we arm our clients with compelling economic talking points, tables, maps and reports that can be used to educate policy makers, members of the media and other key stakeholders on important issues. \nJohn Dunham and Associates have been partners with us by providing timely and relevant information that has enabled us to defeat erroneous excise tax proposals throughout the country. They understand how to drill down to deliver the message that matters most. \nRochelle Marte Director, State Government Affairs, MillerCoors ...wood, lacquer, a printed label, graphite lead, a bit of metal, and an eraser..."
