Our original definition of β in Eq. (12.39) made use of a quantity 8入, defined to be the shift of the renormalizedcoupling $\\lambda$ needed topreserve the values ofthebare Green'sfunctions when the renormalization point is shifted infinitesimally. Since the bare Green'sfunctions depend on thebare coupling $\\lambda_{0}$ and the cutoff, this definition canberewritten as \n$$\n\\beta(\\lambda)=M{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}}\\lambda{\\biggr|}_{\\lambda_{0},\\Lambda}.\n$$\nThus the $\\beta$ functionistherateofchangeoftherenormalizedcouplingat the scale $M$ corresponding to a fixed bare coupling.Recalling our analysisin Section 12.1, it is tempting to associate X(M) with the coupling constant X' obtained by integrating out degrees of freedom down to the scale M. With this correspondence, the $\\beta$ function is just the rate of the renormalization group flowofthecouplingconstant $\\lambda$ .Apositivesignforthe $\\beta$ function indicates a renormalized coupling that increases at large momenta and decreases at small momenta.We can see explicitly that this relation works for $\\phi^{4}$ theory, toleading orderin $\\lambda$ ,by comparing Eqs.(12.28) and (12.46).We will justify thiscorrespondencefurtherinthefollowingsection. \nThe equalityof theexactformula(12.64)withthefirst-order formula (12.53) again follows from the counterterm definitions (10.17).As with (12.63), itisnotobviousthatthisformulafor $\\beta(\\lambda)$ isindependentof $\\Lambda$ ,butthatfact again follows from renormalizability.
