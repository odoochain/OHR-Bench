The quotient space $E/F$ is Hausdorff and finite-dimensional and the naturalprojection $\\pi\\colon E\\to E/F$ is continuous.Its restriction $\\pi|_{G}$ to $G$ is an algebraic,hencebytheproventheoremalsoatopologicalisomorphismbetween $G$ and $E/F$ .The projection $p_{G}\\colon E\\to G$ has the form $p_{G}=(\\pi|_{G})^{-1}\\circ\\pi.$ hence iscontinuous. 口 \n1.5.4.Definition. A subset $A$ ofa topologicalvector space $E$ is called precompact or totally bounded if, for every neighborhood ofzero $V$ in $E$ onecan findafiniteset $\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}$ in $E$ suchthat $A\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+V)$ \nThe set $\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}$ iscalled afinite $V$ -net (or an $E$ -net if $V$ is a ball of radius $E$ in a metric space). It is easily seen that every compact set in a topological vector space is precompact.We observe (this fact is not needed now, so it will be proven in $\\S1.8$ after we discuss completions of topological vector spaces) that a subset of a topological vector space is precompact precisely when its closure in the completion of this topological vector space is compact. However, the closure of a precompact set in an incomplete space may fail to be compact. \n1.5.5. Lemma. Every precompact subset of $a$ topological vector space is bounded. \nPROOF. Let $A$ be a precompact subset of a topological vector space $E$ and let $V$ be a neighborhood of zero in $E$ ；wehavetoprovethatthere exists $\\nu>0$ such that $A C t V$ if $|t|>\\nu$ .Let $W$ be a circledneighborhood ofzero such that $W+W\\subset V$ and let $a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}$ be elements of $E$ for which $A\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+W)$ Let $\\nu>1$ be such that $\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\subset t W$ if $|t|>\\nu$ .Then for such numbers $t$ wehave \n$$\nA\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+W)\\subset t W+W\\subset t W+t W=t(W+W)\\subset t V,\n$$\nwhichshowsthat $A$ isbounded. \n1.5.6.Theorem.A Hausdorff topological vector space $E$ overthefieldIRor $\\mathbb{C}$ is finite-dimensional if and only if it possess a compact neighborhood of zero. Moreover,it is sufficient that it possess a precompact neighborhood of zero. \nPROOF. The necessity is clear from Theorem 1.5.1, since any Hausdorff topologicalvector space(over a nondiscretecompletenormedfield $\\mathbb{K}$ )of finite dimension $\\mathcal{n}$ is isomorphic （as a topologicalvector space) to the space $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$ ,and if $S$ is acompactneighborhoodofzeroin $\\mathbb{K}$ thentheproductof $n$ copies of $S$ is a compactneighborhoodofzeroin $\\mathbb{\\ K}^{n}$ \nLet us prove the sufficiency (the given proof is due to Gleason). Let $V$ bea precompact neighborhood of zero in $E$ andlet $a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\in E$ be elements such that \n$$\nV\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}\\left(a_{k}+{\\frac{1}{2}}V\\right).\n$$\nWe show that the linear span of the set $A=\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}$ coincides with the whole space,i.e.,that every element in $E$ is a linear combination of elements of"
