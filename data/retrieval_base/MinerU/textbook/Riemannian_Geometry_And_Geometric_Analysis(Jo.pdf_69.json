        "text": "necessarily nondegenerate quadratic form on $V$ would suffice,buthere we have no need to investigate the most general possible construction. On the contrary, for our purposes it suffices to take $\\mathbb{H}_{5}^{n}$ with its standard Euclidean scalar product. An orthonormal basis will be denoted by $e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}$ \nDefinition 1.8.1 The Clifford algebra $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ , also denoted $\\operatorname{Cl}(n)$ , is the quotient of the tensor algebra $\\bigoplus_{k\\geq0}V\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes V$ generated by $V$ by the two sided ideal generated by all elements of the form $v\\otimes v+\\|v\\|^{2}$ for $v\\in V$ \nThus, the multiplication rule for the Clifford algebra $C1(V)$ is \n$$\nv w+w v=-2\\langle v,w\\rangle\n$$\nIn particular, in terms of our orthonormal basis $e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}$ ,wehave \n$$\n{e_{i}}^{2}=-1\\mathrm{and}e_{i}e_{j}=-e_{i}e_{j}\\mathrm{for}i\\ne j.\n$$\nFrom this, one easily sees that a basis of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ as a real vector space is given by \n$$\ne_{0}:=1,\\quad e_{\\alpha}:=e_{\\alpha_{1}}e_{\\alpha_{2}}\\dots e_{\\alpha_{k}}\n$$\nwith $\\alpha=\\{\\alpha_{1},...,\\alpha_{k}\\}\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ and $\\alpha_{1}<\\alpha_{2}\\ldots<\\alpha_{k}$ . For such an $\\boldsymbol{C}$ ,we shall put $|\\alpha|:=k$ in the sequel. Thus, as a vector space, $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ is isomorphic to $\\varLambda^{*}(V)$ (as algebras, these two spaces are of course different). In particular, the dimension of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ as a vector space is $2^{n}$ .Also, declaring this basis as being orthonormal, we obtain a scalar product on $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ extending the one on $V^{'}$ \nWe define the degree of $e_{\\alpha}$ as being $|\\alpha|$ . The $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ of degree $k$ generate the subset $\\operatorname{Cl}^{k}(V)$ of elements of degree $k$ Wehave \n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathrm{Cl^{0}}=\\mathbb{R}}\\ {\\mathrm{Cl^{1}}=V.}\\end{array}\n$$\nFinally, we let $\\mathrm{Cl}^{e v}(V)$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{o d d}(V)$ be the subspaces of elements of even, resp. odd degree. The former is a subalgebra of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ ,butnot thelatter. \nLemma 1.8.1 The center of $\\operatorname{Cl}(V)$ consists of those elements that commute withall $v\\in\\mathrm{Cl}^{1}(V)=V$ .For $n$ even, the center is $\\operatorname{Cl}^{0}(V)$ ,while for n odd, it is $\\mathrm{Cl}^{0}(V)\\oplus\\mathrm{Cl}^{n}(V)$ \nProof. It suffices to consider basis vectors $e_{\\alpha}~=~e_{\\alpha_{1}}\\ldots\\ldots e_{\\alpha_{k}}$ as above. For $j\\not\\in\\alpha$ ,wehave \n$$\ne_{\\alpha}e_{j}=(-1)^{|\\alpha|}e_{j}e_{\\alpha},\n$$\nand thus $\\left|\\alpha\\right|$ has to be even for $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ to commute with $\\epsilon_{j}$ ,while \n$$\ne_{\\alpha}e_{\\alpha_{j}}=(-1)^{|{\\alpha}|-1}e_{\\alpha_{j}}e_{\\alpha},\n$$"
