Notwithstanding its lack of biophysical realism, however, Poisson type models are veryimportant in the neurosciences because,on one hand,they relate well to the experimental practice of recording spikes, and on the other hand, they can be the basis for models of information transmission in neural systems. \n# \nReferences for this section are [80,56]. \nWe start with the simplest branching process,the Galton-Watson process.Here,each individual lives in a fixedgeneration $n$ and independentlyof all otherindividuals produces a random number of offspring that become members of generation $n+1$ This random variable,the number of offspring,is the same for all individuals in allgenerations.Thus,the numbers of offspring for theindividuals areindependent and identically distributed random variables. We denote their common generating function by $G(s)$ .We also assume that there is a positive probability for havingmore than one offspring. If the probability of having $m$ offspring is $p(m)$ ,this means that $p(0)+p(1)<1$ \nLettherandomvariable $Z_{n}$ denote the sizeofgeneration $n$ Oneusuallyassumes that the process starts with a single individual in generation O, that is, $Z_{0}=1$ Let $G_{n}(s)=E(s^{Z_{n}})$ be the generating function of $Z_{n}$ \nLemma 3.4.1. $G_{n}$ isthe $n$ -thfolditerateof $G$ \n$$\nG_{n}(s)=G\\circ\\cdots\\circ G(s),\n$$\nandthusalsoform, $n\\in\\mathbb N$ \n$$\nG_{m+n}(s)=G_{m}(G_{n}(s)).\n$$\nProof. We shall show (3.4.2) which easily implies (3.4.1) by iteration. Let the randomvariable $Y_{i}$ denotethenumber ofmembersof the $(m+n)$ thgenerationthat derivefrommember $i$ ofthemthone.Wethenhave \n$$\nZ_{m+n}=Y_{1}+\\cdots+Y_{Z_{m}}.\n$$\nBy our assumptions,the $Y_{i}$ are independent and identically distributed, in fact identicalto $Z_{n}$ , the number of offspring deriving from an individual $n$ generations ago. Lemma 3.1.3 c) then yields the claim. 口"
