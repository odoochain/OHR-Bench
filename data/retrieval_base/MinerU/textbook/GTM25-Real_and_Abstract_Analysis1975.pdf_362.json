Let (X,α,μ) be a decomposable measure space (19.25). Then the mapping $T$ definedby \n$$\nT(g)=L_{\\bar{g}}\n$$\n[see (20.16)] is a norm-preserving linear mapping of ${\\mathfrak{L}}_{\\infty}$ onto the conjugate space Q. Thus, as Banach spaces, $\\mathfrak{L}_{\\infty}a n d\\mathfrak{L}_{1}^{*}$ are isomorphic. \nProof. The fact that $T$ is a norm-preserving mapping from $\\mathfrak{L}_{\\infty}$ into $\\mathfrak{L}_{1}^{*}$ is (20.16). It follows from (20.19) that $T$ is onto ${\\mathfrak{L}}_{1}^{*}$ . It is trivial that $T$ is linear. Since $T$ is both linear and norm-preserving, it is one-to-one. \n(20.21) Note. As we have shown in (20.17), the conclusion in (20.20) fails for some nondecomposable measure spaces. However J. ScHwARTz has  found  a  representation  of ${\\mathfrak{L}}_{1}^{*}\\left(X,{\\mathcal{A}},\\mu\\right)$ forarbitrary $(X,{\\mathcal{A}},\\mu)$ [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2 (1951), 270-275], to which the interested reader is referred. \n(20.22) Exercise. Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space and let $\\ell$ be an outer measure on $\\mathcal{P}\\left(X\\right)$ as in $\\S9$ . Prove that the definitions of local $\\ell$ -nullity given in (9.29) and in (20.11) are equivalent. \n(20.23) Exercise. Let $(X,{\\mathcal{A}},\\mu)$ be a degenerate measure space such that $\\mu\\left(X\\right)=\\infty$ [see (10.3) for the definition]. Is this measure space decomposable? Find $\\mathfrak{L}_{1},\\mathfrak{L}_{1}^{*}$ , and ${\\mathfrak{L}}_{\\infty}$ explicitly for this measure space. \n(20.24) Exercise. Let $(X,{\\mathcal{A}},\\mu)$ be  any  measure  space  and  let $f\\in\\mathfrak{L}_{1}(X,\\mathcal{A},\\mu)$ .Define $L$ on ${\\mathfrak{L}}_{\\infty}(X,{\\mathcal{A}},\\mu)$ by \n$$\n{\\cal L}\\left(g\\right)=\\int g\\bar{f}d\\mu.\n$$\nProve that $L\\in\\mathfrak{L}_{\\infty}^{*}$ and that $\\|L\\|=\\|f\\|_{1}$ \n(20.25) Exercise. Prove that $\\mathfrak{L}_{1}([0,1])$ [with Lebesgue measure] is not refexive by showing that not every $L\\in\\mathfrak{L}_{\\infty}^{*}([0,1])$ has the form described in (20.24). [Hint. Use the H.hn-Banach theorem to produce an $L\\neq0$ such that $L\\left(g\\right)=0$ for all ${\\boldsymbol{g}}\\in{\\mathfrak{L}}_{\\infty}$ for which $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is essentially continuous, ? $i,e,\\|g-h\\|_{\\infty}=0$ for some $h\\in{\\mathfrak{C}}([0,1]).$ 1J \n(20.26) Exercise. (a) Prove that ${\\mathfrak{L}}_{\\infty}([0,1])$ is not separable. \n(b) Find necessary and sufficient conditions on a measure space that its $\\mathfrak{L}_{\\infty}$ space be separable.
