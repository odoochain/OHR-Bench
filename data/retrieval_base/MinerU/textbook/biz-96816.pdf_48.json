Are all issues created equally?What is your plan to address all isues? \nA good waytooutlineisto organizeyourfacts aswediscused above.Forexample,thinkbacktothat table: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nRuleElement & FactsFor & FactsAgainst & Resolution \\\\\nSelf-propelled & Motorscootershave anengine and canmovewithout“manpower” & Canalsomovewithonly manpower, meaning therider can use theirfeet togetittomove & Whichisthepredominant use? \\\\\nNotrunning onrails & Norailsonamotorscooter \\\\\nRunsoverland & Can'tfly \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nYou might notice that there isn't much to talk about with“runs over land.”I mean, a motorized scooter certainly doesn't fly in the air, so this feels obvious. But “self-propelled” seems to have more to discuss! So that means you will likely want to spend more time onthe issue of whether amotor scooteris self-propelled than whether it runs over land. \nIf there are multiple issues,you can also use this type of chart to determine which issue requires the most time. \nSpeaking of issues, outlining will help you issue spot. You will hear this as a buzzword all around: that you need to“spot the issues”or“issue spot.\"But what does that mean?Remember that a hypothetical is essentially a story.So your jobis to read the story and determine the“issues”or questions to solve.A professor may ask you a very directed question, such as“Did Defendant commit murder?\",in which case,your issue-spotting just got much easier!However, it is more than likely that the professor will end thehypothetical story with“What aretherights of the parties?”or“What crimescanBobbe chargedwith?” \nThis means that a large part of earning points on your exam is figuring out what issues, or legal problems, to solve. Everyon tackles thisinaslightly differentway.However,I suggest taking one of the twomethodsdescribedbelow andmaking it your own. \n# \nIn doing the outlining that I mentioned above, you can create a mini-outline or “attack outline,”which is what I just call a checklist.Essentially, it should be a one-page list of the types of lawyou covered.For example,in a torts class,you are going tocovervarioustypes of torts.Therefore,yourchecklistmight looksomethinglike this: \n1. Intentional Torts \na.Assault   \nb.Battery   \nc.False Imprisonment   \nd.Trespass   \ne.Trespass to Chattels   \nf. Conversion \n2. Negligence \nNote that this is an incomplete checklist, and the complete version willook different depending on your professor and class. The idea is that if Ihave this memorized,I can quickly go through the fact pattern to see if any of the torts showup.Part of your checklist might also be to add in “activating facts.\" What I mean by that is, if you are looking for an assault, or a battery, whatareyoulookingfor? \nFor example,forbattery,Imight know that Ineed a person in the fact pattern to touch another person,so I'm indicating that in my checklist.I can go through the story and think,“Alright, is anyone touching someone else? If so, could that be a battery?\" Similarly, trespass requires land or entering the land of another. Is that showing up in the facts? Adding these types of “\"activating facts\"'to our checklist might look like this: \n1. Intentional Torts a.Assault"
