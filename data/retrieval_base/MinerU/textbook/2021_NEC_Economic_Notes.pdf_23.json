Price levels slow and may fall down. \n· Trough - cycle's minimum real GDP, end of contraction. Wide spread unemployment followed by expansion (recovery). \n· Sometimes called economic fluctuations because they are not predictable. \n# \n· Long-term growth trend - the straight line that shows how output grows when the fluctuations are removed. The output is known as the potential output. \n· Unemployment falls when real GDP grows (expansion) ·firms hire more labor and increase quantity of output · Unemployment increases when real GDP falls (contraction) ·firms cut production and have to fire some workers \nWhen an economy experiences full employment, there is still a natural rate of unemployment. \n·If actual ${\\tt G D P>}$ potential GDP, unemployment is lower than the natural rate.   \nIf potential GDP $>$ actual GDP, unemployment is greater than the natural rate. \n· There is a GDP (output) gap if the actual GDP is above/below the potential GDP. \n# \n· Real output growth mean that there's a chance to have higher standards of living. · Large fluctuations not desirable, because with expansion, inflation could happen and witl a contraction, unemployment increases.   \n· Some key macroeconomic objectives: rapid economic growth, full employment, and price stability."
