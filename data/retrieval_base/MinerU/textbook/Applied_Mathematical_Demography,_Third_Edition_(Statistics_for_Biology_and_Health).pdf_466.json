The age at which a woman has her first child, and the successive interbirth intervals, will evidently make a difference in the rate at which the population grows. Timing is the one element lacking in the present model. For the effect of its omission, consider $h=0.80$ and $k=0.65$ ,sothat $R_{0}=2.63/2.05=1.28$ .Ifthe mean age of childbearing (strictly, the length of generation) is 25 years, the intrinsic rate is 0.0099; if it is 30 years, the intrinsic rate is 0.0082. \n# \nWhen mortality is high, a man who wants to have a son who will see him through his old age requires many children. This point has often been made before, but we still need clarification of the relation between mortality and the rate of population increase among people who want a certain assurance ofsurviving children.With number ofbirths given,the rate ofincrease $r$ goesup as mortality $\\mu_{x}$ goes down; we will see that the relation between $r$ and $\\mu_{x}$ isreversed if the birth rate is determined by the wish to have survivingsons."
