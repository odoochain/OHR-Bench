        "text": "The system of granting letters-patent for inventions has its foundation and origin in the policy of enlightened governments to stimulate and encourage advancement and progress in the industrial arts, and such grants are in their nature analagons to contracts, the inventors and the public being parties thereto. and the consideration being established by statute. \nFrom thisit follows that the right of property which is protected by a patent is defined and measured by the language in which the specification and claims are couched, and in this connection section 4ss8 of the Revised Statutes enacts : \\*Before any inventor or discoverer shall receive a patent for his invention or discovery, he shall make application therefor, in writing, to the Commissioner of Patents, and shall file in the Patent Ofice a written description of the same, and of the manner and process of making, constructing, compounding, and using it, in' such fnll, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected,to make, construct, componnd, and nse the same ; and in case of a machine, he shall explain the principle thereof, and the best mode in which he has contemplated applying that principle, so as to distinguish it from other inventions.\"\\* \nIn following out the requirements of this statute,it is essential that the attorney to whose hands the inventionis committed should have full knowledge of its legal consequences. and be thoroughly and accurately acquainted with the law, and have a competent knowledge ofmechanicsgenerally. \nIt has of late been judicially rendered in this connection that “the description in a patent must be so full and plain that a fairly competent workman in the art could take it and, exercising the then existing knowledge of the trade,follow it out,and by it,without invention or addition,construct an operative machine containing the parts mentioned in combination.Ifit requires experiment and invention to make and use the matter described, the patent is invalid ;\" and to the same effect the like doctrine has been declared in Curtis on Patents, section 255; Turner vs. Winter, 1 D. and E. 602; Evans cs. Eaton, 7 Wheat, 356; McFarlane rs. Price, 1st Stark, 158 ; The King vs. Arkwright, 1 Webs. Patent Cases, 64."

        "text": "Because of the fact that under our practice the courts are without power to afford relief to an inventor if his patent is narrower in scope than his invention, it becomes of prime importance that it should be drawn by those only who are skilled in this department of patent practice, in order that this instrument, which is the contract wherein his rights are pointed out by metes and bounds, may include in it that full, clear and exact description contemplated by the statute, and those clauses designated as claims, so full as to positively and unmistakably extend to and embrace every feature of novelty to which the inventor is entitled. \nIn this connection the matter of competent counsel has been consideredof so great importance that it hasreceivedofficial notice and been reduced to a written rule. The Rules of Practice of the Patent Ofice, under the revision of September 1st, 18so, embody the following : As the value of patents depends largely upon the careful preparation of the specifications and claims, the assistance of competent counsel will in most cases be of advantage to the applicant ; but the value of their services vill be proportionate to their skill and honesty, and too much care cannot be exercised in their selection.'"

        "text": "Another important result of searches of this character is that by them we are brought into contact with the previous inventions of the class under consideration, immediately before preparing our client's case, which enables us the more readily to distinguish between the old and the new, and to bring out the points of novelty and special utility possessed by the new invention. \nUpon the receipt of an intelligible sketch and a brief description, we will advise inventors as to the patentability of their inventions or discoyeries. But for a special search of the character just referred to, we make a charge of five dollars in advance, which fee, should the report be unfavorable, covers the cost of copies of the references, which copies we forward. Buit should the examination result favorably, we report accordingly, and require a renittance of fifteen dollars, the first Government fee. On receipt of this fee, we immediately prepare the necessary drawings, the_petition,oath, and specification, and forward them for the inventor's personal inspection and execution. When these papers are returned to us, together with fifteen dollars, part of our professional charge, the case is promptly filed in the Patent Ofice, and diligently prosecuted. When the application is allowed, the remaining installment of the agency fee, namely, fifteen dollars, is due. The final Government fee of twenty dollars can be paid at any time within six months from the date of the allowance ; but in every instance we advise, in fact recommend. its prompt payment. as delay in this particular not infrequently involves the applicant in a vexatious litigation known as an interference."

        "text": "A patent, the claims of which are properly drawn. is much more easily introduced among manufacturers, for the reason that when submitted to their consnlting counsel he is able to advise them with certainty as to the scope and meaning of the patent; and again this regard to the character of the claims frequently saves the necessity of litigation, since their clearness and unmistakable meaning makes it practicable for the defendant's counsel to pass upon, with comparative ease and certainty, the alleged infringement. \n# \nUpon the fullness, clearness, and accuracy of the drawings depend in many instances not only the value, but also the validity of patents. There is a great number of existing patents which are so poorly illustrated as to make it a difficult matter to ascertain exactly what construction was intended by the inventor.Such defectsprove asource of serious tronblewhen it is desired to dispose ofa patent or to test the validityof thesame should itbebroughtbefore a court ; the anbiguity thus arising making it also neccssary to enter into certain explanations regarding the exact construction of the device, when negotiating with purchasers and manufacturers.To avoid these difficulties is our constant aim,seeing that everyfeature of the invention is properly and clearly illustrated. \n# \nWhile under the present practice of the Patent Office models are not iu every case required, it is discretionary with the Examiner; and by, far the better plan, for an inventor to furnish one. In this way unnecessary delays and expense are inmanyinstances avoided."

Nothing can be embraced in a reissue that was not shown or described in the original patent ; and if the purpose of the reissue is to enlarge or expand the scope of the claims, it is necessary under the recent decisions of the courts, that such reissue application should be muade within a reasonable time after the date of the original, it being unsafe to delay more than two years."

Shouldthe reissue be applied for, this charge is credited on account of the remaining fees, which are governed by the services rendered in each case and agreed upon before it is proceeded with. \n# \nOwing to the fact that applications are frequently rejected.and never afterwards diligently prosecuted, there recessarily accumulates nnder this category a large number of valuable inventions. Cases of this character entrusted to us receive prompt investigation, after which a report ismade as to the real probability of securing a_patent by further and careful prosecution.

Owing to the encouragement held out by the U. S. Patent system, there have developed on this account yery large and extensive business enterprises, which operate exclusively upon patent property and which depend upon letters-patent for their protection. \nIt becomes necessary then that such institutions should be well acquainted with the scope andlegal significance of the patents under which they are operating, for which purpose it is primarily essential that they should ascertain whether their patents are valid, as well as whetherthey are beinginfringed upon byothers. The object of the opinions here alluded to, is to ascertain these facts. To the proper preparation of them it is essential that thorough investigation should be made throngh the U. S. and Foreign patents, and through scientific works relating to the particular subject in hand. \nIt not unfrequently happens that manufacturers engagedin the sale of machinery and different articles of commerce protected by patents, are attacked by threats and allegations from competing firms in the trade, that their goods are infringements of the patents owned by the latter, and that theywill prosecute all persons thus engaged; the result of which is to frequently stifle these business enterprises and to drive off customers, while in many cases no infringement exists. Instancesof this kind have come to our personal knowledge, which have proved a source of serious annoyance and expense.Opinions of the character here referred to are also of use in this connection."
