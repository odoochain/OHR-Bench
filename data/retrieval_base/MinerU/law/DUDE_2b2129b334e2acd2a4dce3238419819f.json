        "text": "# \n# \n# \nThe Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program is a federal/state/local effort to locate parents, their cmployers, and/or their assets; cstablish paternity if necessary; and cstablish and enforce child support orders. State and local CSE offices provide day to day operation of the program. The federal role is to provide funding, issue policies, ensure that federal requirements are met, and interact with other federal agencies that help support the CSE program. \nHow and where do I apply? \nIn most states, CSE offices are listed under the human services agency in the local government section of the telephone directory. If there is not a separate listing, the human services agency information operator should be able to give you the number. State CSE agencies are listed at the end of this brochure; they also can provide telephone numbers for local offices. \nCall your Child Support Enforcement office to learn how to apply for enforcement services and what documents (birth certificates, financial statements, etc.) you should provide. \nWhat are the steps to collecting support? \nThe first step. if a child was born out of wedlock, is to establish paternity - or make a legal determination of who fathered the child. Many men will voluntarily acknowledge paternity. Either parent can request a blood test in contested paternity cases. Your caseworker will help you to establish paternity for your child. \nEstablishing the obligation is the next step. The fair amount of child support that the noncustodial parent should pay is determined according to state guidelines. Your CSE office will be able to tell you how support award amounts are set in your state. Your CSE office can also request medical support for your child. \nThe last step is enforcement of the child support order. The CSE office can help with collecting the money due no matter where the non-custodial parent lives."

        "text": "At any of these steps, the CSE office may need to know where the non-custodial parent is living or where he/she is working. When a parent has disappeared, it is usually possible for the CSE office to find him/her with the help of state agencies, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, or the Federal Parent Locator Service. Your caseworker can tell you what information is nceded to find an absent parent or his/her employer. \nThe most successful way to collect child support is by direct withholding from the obligated parent's paycheck. Most child support orders require the employer to withhold the money that is ordered for child support and send it to the CSE office. Your Child Support Enforcement office can tell you about this procedure. \nFederal and State Income Tax refunds may be withheld to collect unpaid child support. States also have laws which allow them to use: liens on real and personal property; orders to withhold and deliver property; or seizure and sale of property with the proceeds applied to the support debt. Many states routinely report child support debts to credit bureaus and smart parents are bringing their payments current so that their credit won't be affected. \n- For More Information write for the Handbook on Child Support Enforcement.

        "text": "# \n# \nThe Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program is a Federal/State/local effort to establish paternity and to collect child support from parents who are legally obligated to pay. State enforcement programs locate absent parents, establish paternity when necessary, establish and enforce support orders, and collect child support payments. The CSE Program is usually administered through State and county social services departments. \nTeen parenting has become a national crisis. Because the teen mother is often poor and ill-prepared to rear a child, the burden of financial support for the child falls to the taxpayer in the form of public assistance. In 1992, of the 9.2 million children in households receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), 53.1 percent were born out of wedlock. Financial assistance in the form of just AFDC is costing taxpayers about \\$20.1 billion annually, and the problem has been growing larger. In 1992, over 30% of all births in the United States were out of wedlock, and of the 1,224,876 births to unmarried women, 30 percent were to teen-age mothers. Teen parenthood places on both the mother and father responsibilities neither may have ever envisioned. \nIn cases of teen pregnancy, establishing patermity becomes critical. The question, \"Who's the father?\" is asked not out of idle curiosity but out of concern for the mother and the child. The answer can make the difference between whether the child receives financial help from the father or not. The answer can also determine the child's right to certain benefits from the govermment or other sources. \nWhile establishing paternity may not curb teen pregnancy, it establishes legal rights that are important to the mother, the father and the child. \n# \nWhen patermity is established, you can get a legal document which certifies that the alleged father is the legal father of a child. \nWhen paternity is established, you can get a child support order. \nWhen patermity is established, the child's legal rights and privileges can be established, such as right to social security, pension and retirement benefits. These rights and privileges apply until the child becomes 18 or 21 years old, depending on State law. \nWhen patermity is established, the child may be able to interact with both parents as well as both parents' families. Also, the father can claim his right to a relationship with his child. \n#"

        "text": "WHY SHOULD PATERNITY BE ESTABLISHED IF THE FATHER IS STILL IN SCHOOL OR HASNOJOB? \nEven if the father is still in school or has no job, establishing patermity now will make it easier.to actually collect child support when the father is working. \nCAN PATERNITY BE ESTABLISHED IF THE FATHER LIVES IN OR MOVES TO ANOTHER STATE? \nYes. It may be more difficult to establish patermity if the father is out of the State, but States are required by law to cooperate in handling requests for paternity establishment. \n# \nIf the alleged father accepts that he is, in fact, the father, a legal document certifying his paternity is prepared. \nIf the alleged father denies paternity, the case may go to trial, where the judge may order a blood or genetic test and rule on patermity on the basis of testimony and test results. Either party in a patermity dispute may request a blood or genetic test. \n# \nThe results from blood testing can be presented as evidence to establish the relationship between the father and the child. The results can also be used to exclude a man wrongfully accused from consideration as the father. \n# \nThe tests used for paternity establishment have a very high degree of accuracy. A recently developed genetic test has an accuracy rate close to 1o0 percent. \nFOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AND PATERNITY ESTABLISHMENT, PLEASE CONTACT: \nYour State or County Social Services Department or \nThe Administration for Children and Families Ofice of Child Support Enforcement National Child Support Enforcement Reference Center 370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W.
