        "text": "# \n# \nA California state court authorized this notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \nUnder a proposed settlement, the Oakland Police Department has agreed to clear its backlog of outstanding Public Records Act requests and make certain changes to its records request procedures. Among other terms, the Oakland Police Department has agreed to clear its backlog of Public Records Act requests within 144 days of approval of this settlement, except for S.B. 1421 requests (related to certain police misconduct and use-of-force records), which the Oakland Police Department has agreed to clear within 419 days.   \nThe Settlement resolves a lawsuit over whether the Oakland Police Department has violated the Public Records Act and the Oakland Sunshine Ordinance. The two sides disagree about whether Oakland has violated those laws, and about which changes, if any, must be implemented to bring the Oakland Police Department into compliance.   \nThis Settlement only resolves claims with the Oakland Police Department; if you have a pending Public Records Act request with any other department in the City of Oakland, this lawsuit does not affect your rights. The Alameda Superior Court still has to decide whether to approve this Settlement. You have the right to make your views known to the Court. Your rights and options — and the deadlines to exercise them — are explained in this notice. Your legal rights are affected whether you act or don’t act.  Read this notice carefully. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{WHATAREYOUROPTIONS?} \\\\\nDONOTHING & If you do nothing and it is determined that you are part of the Proposed Class, and the within 144 or 419 days of final approval (depending on whether your documents relate to police misconduct), and likely sooner. You will not be able to bring your own lawsuit related to the timing of the production of documents and you will be bound by the Release described in the Settlement. You may still challenge the substance of the Oakland Police Department's production of records if you believe documents have been unlawfully withheld or redacted. \\\\\nEXCLUDE YOURSELF & No change to your current status. If you exclude yourself from this Settlement, or in other Oakland Police Department without regard to this Settlement. You may be entitled to file your own case against the Defendants in this case concerning the adequacy of the Oakland Police Department's Records Determination and the promptness of its production of documents. The deadline to opt out is February 14, 2022. \\\\\nOBJECT & If you do not like all or part of this Settlement, you can write to the Judge, who will consider your objection before deciding whether to approve this Settlement. The deadline for submitting a written objection is February 14, 2022. \\\\\nGO TO THE FINAL FAIRNESSHEARING & You are not required to attend or speak at the hearing on this matter, which is called the final Fairness Hearing. But you may appear at the hearing and ask the Judge to allow you to share your views of the Settlement. The final Fairness Hearing is scheduled for March 24, 2022 at 3:30 p.m. in Department 17 of the Alameda Superior Court. \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "# \nYou may have filed a Public Records Act request with the Oakland Police Department between August 19, 2017 and November 18, 2021. If so, you are a member of a Proposed Class, and may be entitled to benefit from a proposed class action settlement. \nThe Court authorized this Notice because you have a right to know about the proposed Settlement, and about all of you options (including your right to exclude yourself) before the Court decides whether to approve the Settlement. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the proposed Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are available, who is eligible for them and the process for excluding yourself. \nThe Court in charge of the case is the Alameda Superior Court, and the case is known as Morris, et al. v. City of Oakland et al., Case No. RG20072029. \nThe people who sued — three local journalists, a privacy activist, and a privacy organization — are called the Plaintiffs. The City of Oakland, the Oakland Police Department and several of their employees named in this suit are called the Defendants. \n# \nAccording to the Plaintiffs, the Oakland Police Department has failed to properly respond to Public Records Act requests. At the time the lawsuit was filed in August 2020, Plaintiffs alleged that the Oakland Police Department had over 5,700 outstanding Public Records Act requests, many of which were open for years. (Since this lawsuit was filed, the Oakland Police Department has responded to many of those requests, and as of the date of this Notice there are fewer than 1,000 requests outstanding.) Plaintiffs further alleged that the Oakland Police Department failed to properly respond to Public Records Act requests because it did not timely notify requesters of an estimated date for production of documents, which documents would be withheld (if any) and the basis for withholding documents. The Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of all records requesters who had not received an adequate response from the Oakland Police Department (the “Proposed Class”), and to compel the Oakland Police Department to provide a response to its backlog of requests. For similar reasons, the Plaintiffs further alleged that the Oakland Police Department violated the Oakland Sunshine Ordinance, a law that promotes access to government documents and requires timely notice of public meetings. Defendants deny that their responses to records requests violate the Public Records Act, deny that they have violated the Sunshine Ordinance, and believe that the Plaintiffs will not be permitted to maintain this lawsuit as a class action if the case proceeds on its merits. \n# \nIn a class action, one or more people are called Class Representatives. The Class Representatives sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. Those people are known as Class Members, and the entire group is known as the Class. If the Class Members have common or similar claims, one court can resolve the issues for all Class Members, except for those who opt to exclude themselves from the Class. Alameda Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch is in charge of this class action. \nClass Representatives can only propose a Class. The Court has the ultimate authority to approve a Class. The Proposed Class will only become a Class if the Court determines that the Proposed Class Members have enough in common to merit pursuing the case as a group (instead of pursuing numerous cases as individuals). That is known as “certifying a class.” \nThe Class Representatives are four individuals (Scott Morris, Brian Kranz, Sarah Belle Lin, and Michael Katz) and one entity (Oakland Privacy)."

        "text": "# \nFurther litigation regarding the adequacy of the Oakland Police Department’s responses to Public Records Act requests would have taken many more months, and its outcome would be uncertain. Defendants wish to avoid the burden and expense of further litigation. Plaintiffs wish to avoid the uncertainty that the Court would not have certified a Class or given relief as comprehensive as that agreed to in the Settlement. Plaintiffs further believe that securing this Settlement now to compel the Oakland Police Department to clear its outstanding Public Records Act requests will result in faster responses than if Plaintiffs had to complete discovery and move the Court for relief. \n# \n# \nYou can receive the benefits of the Settlement if you are a member of the Proposed Class and do not opt out. You will receive the benefits if the Court ultimately approves the Settlement after it has heard from Class Members. \n# \nThe Court has decided that everyone who fits this description is a member of the Proposed Class: \nAny person who filed a Public Records Act request with the Oakland Police Department between August 19, 201 and November 18, 2021 which was outstanding as of December 9, 2021. \n# \nYes. The following requests and requesters are excluded from the Proposed Class: \n• The Public Records Act requests at issue in BondGraham, et al. v. City of Oakland, et al., Alameda Superior Court Case No. RG20071657.   \n• Anyone who excludes themselves (or “opts out”). \n# \nIf you filed a request with the Oakland Police Department between August 19, 2017 and November 18, 2021 which was outstanding as of December 9, 2021, you a member of the Proposed Class. \nYou may have received documents in response to your request after the Court authorized this Notice. Whether or not your request has been closed and completed to your satisfaction, you are still a member of the Proposed Class. You are entitled to object to the terms of the Settlement that cover changes to the Oakland Police Department’s Public Records Act procedures. If you do not object, you give up the same rights as other members of the Proposed Class. Like other Proposed Class Members, you are not giving up any rights to challenge the adequacy of the Oakland Police Department’s production of documents. \n# \nIf you are still not sure whether you are included in the Proposed Class, you can ask for free help. You can call (925) 256- 0400, visit www.OPDPublicRecordsSettlement.com or email info@OPDPublicRecordsSettlement.com for more information."

        "text": "# \n# \nThere are three aspects to the Settlement. \nFirst, the Oakland Police Department has agreed to clear its backlog of outstanding Public Records Act requests. Within 144 days of final Court approval of this Settlement, the Oakland Police Department will complete all Public Records Act requests submitted by Class Members, except for S.B. 1421 requests related to certain police misconduct and use-of-force records. For S.B. 1421 requests, the Oakland Police Department has agreed to clear its backlog of outstanding requests submitted by Class Members within 419 days, including a release of documents every two weeks until the deadline. \nWhen requesters receive their records (if any), they will also receive a written response from the Oakland Police Department explaining which documents, if any, have been withheld, including a statutory justification for withholding such documents and an explanation why any exemption to disclosure applies. \nSecond, the Oakland Police Department has agreed to change the way it responds to Public Records Act requests. Th Settlement provides: \n• After the Oakland Police Department receives a Public Records Act request, it will conduct a search for documents within 10 days, or 24 days in unusual circumstances (the timeframes currently set forth in the Public Records Act) \n• The Oakland Police Department will then send records requesters a “records determination” within 10 or 24 days providing a general description of the documents it has located from its search, including a rough quantity of the documents it has located and a description of the general categories of documents it has located. The Oakland Police Department will also inform requesters an estimated date of production for the documents it has located. The search description will enable each requester to confirm that the Oakland Police Department has actually searched for records and that their request is being processed. \n• If the Oakland Police Department intends to withhold any documents, it will provide a justification for doing so, including a citation to any statutory exemption to disclosure that applies, and why that statutory exemption applies to the specific records requested. \n• If the Oakland Police Department requires an extension from 10 to 24 days to provide a records determination, it will notify each requester of the specific reasons under the Public Records Act why an extension is necessary. \nThird, the Settlement implements other reforms: \n• The Oakland City Attorney’s Office will provide Public Records Act training to Oakland Police Department staff responsible for implementation of this Settlement and the Public Records Act. The Oakland City Attorney’s office will draft a training manual for staff use. \n• The Oakland Police Department will update its internal regulations (known as “Departmental General Orders” or “DGOs”) to reflect the terms of this Settlement. Under the updated DGOs, division commanders in the Oakland Police Department will be responsible for their division’s compliance with the Public Records Act. \n• For the next two years, the head of the Public Records Unit in the Oakland Police Department will prepare a report identifying delinquent requests every two weeks for the Chief of Police, the Chief’s executive team, and each division commander to ensure ongoing compliance. \n• The Oakland Police Department will make a personnel roster, its policies, and DGOs available on the City’s website as they are updated from time to time."

All members of the Proposed Class are automatically included unless they take steps to exclude themselves or “opt-out.” The process for opting out is explained below. \nYou may also object to the Settlement if you disagree with its terms. The process for objecting is also explained below. \n# \nProposed Class Members will receive their records within 144 days of approval of this Settlement, unless you made a request that includes police misconduct or use-of-force records under S.B. 1421, in which case you will receive your records within 419 days. Most Proposed Class Members will receive their records earlier as the Oakland Police Department will be releasing documents on a rolling basis as it clears the backlog. \n# \nNo. Plaintiffs did not file any claim for money damages in this case. The Public Records Act does not authorize money damages. \n# \nThe Court will retain jurisdiction over this Settlement until the Oakland Police Department has cleared its backlog of both S.B. 1421 and non-S.B. 1421 requests to ensure compliance with the Settlement. During that timeframe (or the last six months prior to dismissal), the Oakland Police Department will be required to meet its estimates for document production $80\\%$ of the time. \nWhile the Court retains jurisdiction over the Settlement, the Oakland Police Department must abide by the followin estimates for production of documents: \n• Crime Reports (except for homicide): 15 days from receipt of request.   \n• Tow Reports: 10 days from receipt of request.   \n• Computer Assisted Dispatch logs for a single incident: 20 days from receipt of request.   \n• Call for Service Logs at a single address: 20 days from receipt of request. \nThe Oakland City Attorney and Chief of Police will also prepare periodic reports for the Oakland City Council and the Court regarding Defendants’ compliance with the Settlement while Class Members’ requests remain outstanding. After the first such report — approximately two months after approval of the Settlement — the City Attorney and Chief of Police will publicly appear at an open meeting of the City Council to answer questions regarding compliance with the Settlement. \n# \nIf you stay in the Proposed Class, you give up three important rights. \nFirst, you agree to waive any claims that the Oakland Police Department has not promptly provided you with documents in response to your Public Records Act request(s) that are covered by this lawsuit, i.e. those requests filed between August 19, 2017 and November 18, 2021. \nSecond, you agree to waive any claims that the Oakland Police Department has failed to provide you with an adequate records determination in response to your Public Records Act request(s) that are covered by this lawsuit, i.e. those requests filed between August 19, 2017 and November 18, 2021. \nThird, you agree to waive all claims with respect to the adequacy of the Oakland Police Department’s forward-looking commitments outlined in paragraph 10, namely the “records determination” reforms."

You may or may not receive documents by the deadlines set under the Settlement. \nYou can separately sue to try to obtain your documents sooner than the deadlines agreed to in this Settlement. You ma need to file your own lawsuit and retain your own lawyer if you wish to pursue individual claims outside of this Settlement \n# \n# \nThe Court has asked three law firms — Ferguson Law PC, The Meade Firm p.c. and Reiser Law, P.C. — to represent you and other members of the Proposed Class.  These lawyers are called Class Counsel. You will not be billed for these lawyers. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \n# \nClass Counsel filed this case on a contingency basis, meaning they did not know whether they would be paid when they filed this lawsuit. Class Counsel have incurred approximately $\\$10,000$ in costs on behalf of Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class. Defendants have agreed to pay Class Counsel $\\$123,400$ as part of the Settlement Agreement. Under the Public Records Act, a prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees. Defendants do not agree that the Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties, but as part of the Settlement have agreed to pay Class Counsel a lump sum to settle claims related to Plaintiffs’ alleged entitlement to attorney’s fees and costs. \n# \n# \nIf you don’t want to participate in this Settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue the Oakland Police Department and the other defendants named in this lawsuit on your own about the legal issues in this case, then you must take steps to get out.
