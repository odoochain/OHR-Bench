        "text": "# \nFirstEnergy entities, Energy Harbor entities, Juan Cespedes, Charles Jones, Michael Dowling, Samuel Randazzo, and Randazzo entities (hereinafter “Responding Defendants\") resist the State's request to partially lift the stay in proceedings primarily on arguments that (1) the Agreed Order entered into ten months ago,is a contract which this Court is barred fron disturbing at the request of the State, (2) the indicted and unindicted defendants'self-incrimination protections are at stake, and (3) FirstEnergy's recent Deferred Prosecution Agreement, revealing an additional branch of bribery related to HB. 6 involving the former Chair of the Public Uilities Commission of Ohio, is insufficient to show “fand, mistake, or other extraordinary circumstances” to menit lifing the stay in these civil proceedings. Perhaps in the world of\\*a giant lobbying firm that nuns a utility,3 admission of bribery of public state offhcials and paying a \\$230 million penalty is another day in the corporate world, but to the citizens of Ohio it is a big deal, and fully justifes reevahuating the status of the pause placed on the State to have its day in Court. \nVarious Responding Defendants argue that the State is not honoring the terms of the Agreed Order. That is wrong. Save for minor procedural requirements, the State let the case remain stayed and did not pursue discovery. Only ofter FirstEnergy admitted its culpability in the underlying HB. 6 scaodal, revealing a provable new aspect of the bribery scandal involving the former Chair of the PUCO, did the State seek to lift the stay to add new parties and new clains. Amending of the Complaint was precisely justified based on the change in landscape that was argued in the State's oniginal Motion. So too is the State's current Motion to partially lift the stay. Simply put, the oniginal grounds for the stay are no longer in effect. As was evident from the hearing where the parties and the Court discussed te stay, and the language indicating that the parties would regularly check in with the Court during the stay, the Count and the parties knew that the grounds could shift, requiring the stay to be revisited. FirstEnergy's DPA and the advancing Of other civil cases are just such circumstances."

        "text": "A. The Agred Order to stay the enire case was not a lit-for-tat for decoupling. \nIt is oversimplifed for the Responding Defendants to argue that the State agreed to the stay in “exchange for discontinuation of decoupling charges\". (FirstEnergy Memo Contra, Pg. 4.) It is trne that once the decoupling charges ended, the State saw no basis for the case to advance further at that time, based largely upon this Court's earlier discovery orders based on the pending prosecution. Thus, while the agreements were reached together, it is disingenuous for FirstEnergy to now argue that it would have contested ending decoupling had the stay not occurred. \nThe stay was based upon the Court's agreenent with FirstEnergy's argument that “[mjoving forward with discovery now would inevitably impair FirstEnergy's ability to defend this case and interfere with the government's prosecution of the parallel criminal case.\" (FirstEnergy Motion to Stay Discovery, Dec. 2. 2020, Pg. 1.) When this Court granted the discovery stay at the preliminary injunction,it acknowledged that the uncertainty offuture criominal Indictments for “unindicted Defendants\" was a key factor. \n\"It's clear to the Court, based on news reports, that this is still an ongoing investigation as well. ... It's quite possible that other individuals may be implicated in the federal criminal matter. \n...At some point discovery will have to go forward; but given the early stage of all these cases and the interest of the Defendants and the unindicted Defendants interest as well in defending their case and presenting an adequate effective defense, I think that staying all discovery in all three cases is appropriate for right now.\" (Tr. Pre. Inj, Hrg., Dec. 21, 2020, pgs. 15-16) \nWhile not using FirstEnergy by name, it can hardly be a stretch of logic to equate “the unindicted Defendants' interest' withi a certain “Company A from the Federal Indictment. Thus, while FirstEnergy may now want to claim that it“never cited its own potental crininal exposure as justification for the stay” (enphasis in oniginal) (FirstEnergy Meno Contra, pg. 8), FirstEnergy chose not to clarify that position when this Court was believing otherwise and granted the stay that FirstEnergy requested nearly a year ago."

        "text": "Recall that that the Agreed Order was entered into just a few weeks before this Court was to review its discovery stay, and at a time when FirstEnergy was using its potential criminal indictment exposure as a shield. To suggest that the Agreed Order was narrowly tailored to decoupling and wholly unconnected to the federal cniminal case against FirstEnergy is laughable. \nEnergy Harbor and other Responding Defendants press hard the claim that the Agreed Order is a binding contract forever shacking the parties until its terms expire, and that this Court is helpless regarding its own docket and must wait until \"all criminal proceedings\" are completed. (Energy Harbor Memo Contra, pgs. 3-5.) However, this Court did not, aud cannot, abandon its responsibilitiesin favor of any agreement by the parties to the contrary. For all of Energy Harbor's research in “the Tenth District and courts across the country” and bhuster regarding “hornbook law\" that Agreed Order is a binding contract, none of the Responding Defendants’ cited cases involved agreed orders regarding stays of proceedings.The relied upon cases involved some compromise exchusively between parties and did not require the trial court to give up its own nghts over the docket.

        "text": "0f Covington v. Covington Landing Lid Parinership, 71 F3d 1221, 1223 (6th Cir.1995) dease payments of property.) A court is master of its docket, not the parties. The State never considered the stay to be a contract, simply a mere reflection of the status of the case that then existed. \nDefendants’ falure to cite a singie case involving a stay being interpreted as a binding contract that tenminated this Court's authority to control its own docket speaks vohumes. \n# \nAlthough they admit that they hold no Fifth Amendment rights as corporations, FirstEnergy and Energy Harbor nevertheless argue that they seek to protect the nights of their natural person co-Defendants, and by extension, any Fifh Amendment nights invoked in discovery by those individuals would potentially harm the corporate defendants’ ability to defend themselves. (FirstEnergy Memo Contra, Pgs. 8-9 and Energy Harbor pgs. 7-10.) Similarly, unindicted natural defendants Jones and Dowling also seek to raise the shield of their indicted co-defendants for their own defense. (Jones and Dowling Meno Contra, pgs. 7-9) But as explained in the State's underlying Motion, both state and federal courts are in accord that Fifth Amendment protections are not a safe harbor from being called to answer in a companion civil matter. State ex rel. Verhovec v. Aascio, 81 0hio St.3d 334, 336, 1998-0hio-431, 691 N.E.2d 282 (1998), followed, Ohio Bar Liab. Ins. Co. v. Silverman, 10th Dist. Franklin No.05AP-923, 2006-Ohio-3016, 1 12 (\"Ohio law is clear that the protection against compulsory self-incrimination does not extend to prohibit civil litigation where the possibility of prosecution exists, nor does it require staying a related civil case until a criminal appeal is resolved\") \nThus, neither indicted defendants Householder and Borges, nor unindicted defendants Jones, Dowling, and Randazzo, have any Fifh Amendment protections in this civil RICO matter. Consequently, if there is no Fifth Amendment natural person protection during the pendency of a civil matter, hen it certainly cannot be an extension to non-natural persons or unindicted parties The defendants to this case should no longer be protected by the general stay. Responding Defendants' legal support is inapposite."

LEXIS 16576 Feb. 7, 2013), the defendants were two individuals and eight companies, which were jointly or partially run by one of the defendants. Logically, the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege by a corporate officer will impair a corporate defendant's ability to defend itself. (Id. at \\*11.) Similar issues played out in other cases cited by Responding Defendants. In re Adelpha Conmuns. Secs. Liigation, E.D.Pa. No. 02-1781, 2003 U.S. Dist.

But, as was apparent from the State's Moion, the State sought the partial lift to be mindfil of those parties whose Ongoiog crimioal proceedings have not been resolved. If implementation is a concero (Randazz0 Memo Contra, pg. 4), this Court ia capable of crafing a scheduling order that balances the rights of all the parties while allowing some discovery to move forward. \nInterestingly, Energy Harbor points out \" [djiscovery in this case is a cross-section of eightlane highways, given the number of parties and noo-parties (which includes over 70 members of the General Assembly) who will ulimately participate in very complicated discovery. both in terms of substance and process.\" (Energy Harbor Meno Contra, pgs. 2-3.) Jones and Dowling recently indicated that they too believe the breadth of discovery in defending the fundamental allegations of H.B. $\\mathfrak{G}$ extends to mumerous public offcials\\*. Thus, the mumber of potential witnesses, makes lifting the stay even more justified, nof less. Moreover, waiting to get knee-deep In documents, which by some accounts could number in the millions', justifies lifing the stay now, not continuing to sit idle while the criminal case plays out potentially years into the future. \nC.No harm comcs to defendants by reguiring them lo do in State court what they are Comnelea te doin Federa Court."

        "text": "FirstEnergy complains that the federal ligation discovery is not \"in the normal course” and has only just begun. Importantly, FirstEnergy also argues that the federal discovery cannot close until the criminal proceedings end. (FirstEnergy Memo Contra, pg. 10.) The potential delay to the closing of federal discovery is not a reason to delay beginning state discovery. \nMoreover, the inference, suggested by Responding Defendants, that once the crininal case is resolved, that magically the civil litigation here will move smoothly is an illusion. Where discovery has been pemitted, FirstEnergy has been aggressively resisting'. There is simply no reason to believe that FirstEnergy will he more amenable to discovery in “years” currently forecasted for this case to continue until “final resohutnion of all criminal proceedings. \nFor its part, Energy Harbor clains that the State is not missing out on the discovery being exchanged in the federal civil cases, which is subject to a stipulated protective order, and to which Householder aod other defendants are not named parties. (Energy Harbor Memo Contra, pg. 15.) This is a non-sequtur. Federal case discovery is at least moving forward. And while he state may not have access to that discovery it should not be denied the opportunity for its own. \n# \nDiscovery is proceeding in other fora. The State is highly interested in being the puime mover in cleaning up the shameful public comiption that has blemished the State. It should not be kept in the dark, while private plaintiffs and actors before the PUCO receive discovery. \nFor the reasons stated in the State Motion's previously filed and this Reply herein, the request for partially lifting the stay of proceeding should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted,"
