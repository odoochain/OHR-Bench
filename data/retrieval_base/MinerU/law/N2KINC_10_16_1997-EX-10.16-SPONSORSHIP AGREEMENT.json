The omitted portions, marked by $[\\star\\star\\star\\star]$ , have been separately filed with the Commission. \n# \nThis agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into as of the 23rd day of September, 1997 (\"Effective Date\"), by and between Excite, Inc., a California corporation, located at 555 Broadway, Redwood City, California 94063 (\"Excite\"), and N2K Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, located at 55 Broad Street, 26th Floor, New York, New York, 10004 (\"Sponsor\"). \n# \nA. Excite maintains a site on the Internet at http://www.excite.com (the \"Excite Site\") and owns and/or manages related Web Sites worldwide (collectively, the \"Excite Network\") which, among other things, allow users to search for and access content and other sites on the Internet.   \nB. Excite also maintains and/or manages certain Web pages which may be delivered to users via email, desktop \"channels\" or Internet \"push\" technologies (collectively, \"Broadcast Pages\") which may incorporate content supplied to Excite by third parties for the purpose of providing value to Excite users and providing access to the content, products and/or services of such third parties.   \nC. Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at http://www.musicblvd.com (the \"Sponsor Site\") and other Web sites through which it makes this merchandise and this content available to its users.   \nD. Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users. \nTherefore, the parties agree as follows: \n1. EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\na) \nSponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\" \nCONFIDENTIAL \nshall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or cybercast events). \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30) days advance notice and will work together in good faith to maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become available through Sponsor. \nThe term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement Date. The \"Commencement Date\" means the date on which Excite commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October 15, 1997. \nThe parties' existing agreements regarding sponsorship of the WebCrawler Web site (http://webcrawler.com) and all of the existing advertising buys on the Excite Network will be terminated as of the Commencement Date. Excite will credit Sponsor in an amount equal to $[\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\star\\star\\star\\star}]$ . This credit will be"

Excite will negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next $[\\star\\star\\star\\star]$ in good faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship renewal agreement. If, $[\\star\\star\\star\\star]$ prior to the expiration of the term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music store sponsorships of the Excite Site. \niii) In the event that Excite intends to enter into an agreement with a third party with respect to retail music store sponsorships of the Excite Site before the expiration of the term of the Agreement, Excite will deliver to Sponsor a written notice describing the relevant opportunity. Although Excite will not be required to disclose any information in violation of any nondisclosure agreement between Excite and any third party, the notice will include information sufficient to permit Sponsor to evaluate the requirements for meeting the competing offer for retail music store sponsorship of the Excite Site and to formulate a meaningful response. Sponsor will have $[\\star\\star\\star\\star]$ after receipt of such written notice to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to conclude the agreement. \niv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of its acceptance within the $[\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\star\\star\\star\\star}]$ period, Excite shall have the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such third party, provided the terms and conditions of the agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90) days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered by Sponsor. \n\"Impression\" means any appearance of a link to the Sponsor Site whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and text. More than one Impression may appear on a page, except, however, not more than three (3) Impressions per Channel page will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of these 3 Impressions, at least two (2) will link to pages in the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; not more than two (2) Impressions per generic search results page will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of these 2 Impressions, at least one (1) will link to pages in the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; and no more than one (1) Impression per specific search results page will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. In all events, Excite will make a good faith effort to avoid duplicate Impressions on a single page, but in no event will more than one (1) Impression for the same artist on a Music Product page count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. For the purposes of this Agreement, \"generic search results page\" is an Excite Search results page displayed in response to a query concerning generic music topics and a \"specific search results page\" is an Excite Search results page displayed in response to a query concerning a specific music artist or specific album title. \nb) \nExcite and Sponsor will work together in good faith to define mutually agreeable Impressions in the Excite Site designed to provide content of interest (defined below) to Excite users and/or promote the Sponsor Site, in numbers sufficient to meet the Impression guarantees stated in Section 3. \nExcite and Sponsor will collaborate on the design, appearance, and placement (the \"look and feel\") of all Impressions. Excite will have final approval over the look and feel of the promotional Impressions, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld."
