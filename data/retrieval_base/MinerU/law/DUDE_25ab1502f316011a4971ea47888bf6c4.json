He states the individual, later identified as Devon Klein, steps back and pulls out a gun. Neff states “I started shooting, because I had my gun next to me.\" He further states “I shot him twice in the chest.\" Neff then states then Klein's girlfriend had a gun so he shot her as well. He explained he looked to the side and said Klein's girlfriend had a \"gun pointed right at me.\" He continued stating \"He was holding my girlfriend hostage with the gun.\" He stated that's why he shot her. He said Klein's girlfriend switched pointing the gun from towards his girlfriend to pointing it towards him (Neff). \nAfter being treated at the Canyon vista Medical Center Neff was further transported back to the Sierra Vista Police Department where he was further interviewed. Neff stated he was involved in a conspiracy with Klein to sell \"Pounds\" of weed. Neff stated he assumed a debt from his cousin, Xavier Owens, in California with Klein. He stated the original debt he had with Klein was around \\$2,000 of which he had paid Klein \\$1,500 he withdrew from various bank ATM's using his debit cards. Neff confessed his debt kept changing because he began to be “fronted\" marijuana from Klein to sell. Neff stated he sold between 5 and 10 pounds of Marijuana obtained from Klein during their transactions. Neff stated there would be a large quantity which he articulated as being \\$100,000 worth of various illegal drugs at the residence of Klein and Garcia. \nKelley Hanczyk was interviewed and stated, while waiting in the parking lot of Filiberto's in the drive-thru line, she noticed Klein's vehicle pull up and Neff turn pale white when he saw the vehicle. Hanczyk stated Klein exited his vehicle and came to the driver's side of their vehicle and began speaking with Neff. She would not elaborate on the conversation. She further stated Neff's gun was on his side with his pinky finger on the gun acting like he was concerned about the conversation. \nHanczyk said after a short discussion, Klein punched Neff several times in the face. She described Neff shooting at least twice, exiting the car, and shooting several additional times. At one point, she stated she turned her head looking out her tinted window, looking into the tinted window of the other vehicle and was able to see Garcia pointing a small black handgun at her. She then said she saw Garcia turn and point the gun away from her before hearing the gun shots and observing Garcia's head fly back. Hanczyk stated she did not know the two victims whomNeff shot."

        "text": "It should be noted after Neff shot Klein and Garcia, he Hanczyk drove to their apartment and didn't call police for approximately 30 minutes. This left Neff and Hanczyk time to corroborate their stories. \nDetective Nicola authored a search warrant affidavit and was issued a search warrant for the residence of Neff and Kelley Hanczyk for evidence related to the original shooting incident. During the search of the residence, detectives located a large quantity of drugs and drug paraphernalia which indicated they were manufacturing narcotics. Items located and secured from the residence include \\$2,790 in U.S. currency, about $17.50z$ (Just over of 1 pound) of marijuana, numerous small glass jars w/lids used for storing marijuana THC wax, a higher THC content form of marijuana which is manufactured using butane, a heat source, and the extraction of the liquid. A glass baking pan, metal sheet pan and glass jars used in this process were also secured. In addition, other items consistent with the manufacture of the THC oil, oil, wax and shard including 2 empty butane canisters, scales, and packaging material. It should be noted butane is a product that is used in extracting the \"honey butane oil\" from the marijuana plant. \nDetectives located an additional 23 grams of finished wax product inside two jars, as well as 12 cartridges of suspected “Bobby Blue\" THC oil which is another manufactured THC product. Additional items of manufacture and transporting of the THC wax and oil products include over 50 syringes with plungers, commonly used in the transfer of the THC oil to other devices to be smoked and jars with marijuana residue. A container with 13 grams of an unidentified packed white powdery substance was located in the residence. Based on the texture, location and packaging of this substance and the training and experience of officers conducting the search, it believed this substance is “Shard” and extremely high potency THC manufactured product. A ledger containing drug sales related including names and dollar amounts was also located."

There were also 20 plus grey and blue hand pressed pills found in several bags which appear consistent with the dangerous drug known as extasy, based on training and experience with that drug. \nOn 07/16/2021, Detective Youman received a phone call from Matthew Bursick, who stated he knew all the parties involved. He said Klein and Neff had known each other for years and Landan “bankrolled\" Neff's move from California to Sierra Vista to engage in illegal drug sales for Klein. \nBased on the information listed above, there is clear evidence Neff and Klein were working together to manufacture, transport, and sell the items they had manufactured from the marijuana extract. In addition, buy placing their manufactured marijuana extract product into the “Wonka\" brand named pouches, a legitimately registered company in the sale of THC products, they were fraudulently selling their illegally manufactured product under the “Wonka\" product name. \n\nThomas P.
