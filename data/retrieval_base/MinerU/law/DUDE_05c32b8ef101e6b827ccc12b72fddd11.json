So, the   \n4 request must be made under certain provisions according   \n5 to Rule 122, and the Court, under Rule 122(D), may deny   \n6 or limit the request. And the Court may, on their own   \n7 or upon objection, deny such a request after making   \n8 specific on the record findings that are outlined in   \n9 122(D)(1) 。   \n10 I know that, given the very short   \n11 timeframe that Mr. Morgan filed his motion, there   \n12 wasn't really time for either side to file written   \n13 responses.  I know that the Court, through the judicial   \n14 assistant, sent an email inquiring as to the State and   \n15 defense's position.   \n16 I know that both the State and defense   \n17 object, and I did file follow-up this weekend, just to   \n18 put that in writing.   \n19 However, the more specific objection that   \n20 the State would be making here is really, a lot of   \n21 these issues under (D)(l)(a), impact coverage upon   \n22 right of any party to appear, fair hearing or trial,   \n23 and then likelihood coverage would distract   \n24 participants, coverage would disrupt or distract from   \n25 the dignity of the proceeding."

I know that the 5 Court is familiar with the circumstance of that where 6 there was a promise, just like there was in this 7 request from Mr. Morgan, not to show any of the jurors. 8 And that request was not -- that order 9 was not followed. He did show the jurors.  He 10 published the images of the jurors during the trial, 11 and as a result, that caused us to have to do that 12 trial a second time, and that resulted in a minor 13 victim having to testify twice about being sexually 14 assaulted. 15 So, the State believes that, particularly 16 Mr. Morgan has demonstrated, that he is unable to 17 follow that order, despite his claim of doing so. 18 I would also note, and this ties in to 19 the other motion, there is a concern that the press 20 will not be press available or able to be present in 21 the courtroom. It's 8:4l this morning, no one is here. 22 So, they have the opportunity, and they are waiving 23 that opportunity. 24 But the courtroom is open in this case. \n25 It is a public trial, but the State does believe that"

These are attorneys   \nintervening on behalf of David Morgan and Terri Jo Neff.   \nThey have specifically requested the following relief:  The first request is that at least one reporter be allowed to be present in the courtroom during the proceedings when the jury is present to the extent possible.   \nI find no objection to their -- the   \npermission of one reporter or even two reporters being present in the courtroom during the proceedings;   \nassuming all other safety precautions are taken with respect to the health concerns of the pandemic. I think that we have authorization to have up to 50 people in the courtroom at this time.   \nAssuming that all other safety precautions are met, to wit; masks and social   \ndistancing, that request is not unreasonable, and it is not objected to by the State.   \nTherefore, with respect to the motion to intervene, I am permitting the intervention to address the request sought by the First Amendment Law Firm, and I am granting the first request, to wit; that reporter -- a reporter or two reporters may be present, all other health considerations under phase two of the pandemic guidelines, which I believe we are still under are met.   \nWith respect to the second request of the interveners, that the Court make public the name of the prospective jurors during voir dire, this matter will be denied.   \nConsistent with the previous request not to permit televising or photography of the jury or the trial during its proceeding, the Court has undertaken a system of not making public the names of prospective jurors or final jurors to a jury trial in Cochise   \nCounty.   \nThe names of jurors are made known to the parties, to the defense as well as to the State, for the purpose of permitting the attorneys and the   \ndefendant to know who precisely is prospectively going"

The same concern is -- the   \n6 Court shares the same concern with request No. 3 as   \n7 with request No. 2, that jurors would have the right to   \n8 maintain their privacy, or not, at their request, at   \n9 their own decision, but certainly not the Court's   \n10 decision, nor the press' decision whether those names   \n11 should be made public. The third request made by the   \n12 interveners that the names of jurors be disclosed at   \n13 the conclusion of the trial is therefore denied.   \n14 Finally, request No. 4 that the Court not   \n15 promise jurors that their name will be held   \n16 confidential at the conclusion of the trial is a   \n17 different sort of a request, and it is consistent with   \n18 prior practices of the Court in my experience which is   \n19 to inform prospective jurors that in the event that the   \n20 press wishes to interview them, they may approach the   \n21 jurors individually.   \n22 It will be entirely within the discretion   \n23 of the individual juror to speak with the press or not   \n24 speak with the press to disclose their names, if they   \n25 wish to or not.   \n1 I will -- I will agree with their request   \n2 No. 4, there will be no promise made that jurors' names   \n3 will be kept confidential after trial, but I will   \n4 advise them that it will be within their authority to   \nL5 disclose their own names or not.
