        "text": "# \nIYSCEEDOC.NO.72 FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 10/07/2021 09:48 AM \n# \n\nUpon the foregoing documents, and upon the oral argument on the record of this petition and the motion and cross-motion to dismiss it, respondent's motion to dismiss is granted, as the challenged administrative action is not final and thus not ripe for judicial review. \nThe papers that all parties have submitted are scholarly, but this Court will address the dispositive issue in this CPLR Article 78 proceeding simply. In order to challenge an administrative determination, a petitioner must suffer an immediate and concrete harm. Here, the Certificate of Appropriateness (\"CoA\") that Respondent Landmarks Preservation Commission of the City of New York (\\*\"LPC\") issued for a tall building in the South Street Seaport Historic District is just an initial step, even by the LPC itself, in the actual construction of a building, which, after all, is what petitioners are seeking to prevent. Simply put, the Certificate approved the design, but not the construction, of the building, and the LPC must approve the latter, too. Of particular note, in addition to various other approvals, the city Department of Buildings must approve detailed construction plans, and the LPC must approve those, in a final CoA, before the proverbial shovels can be put in the proverbial (and in this case mercury-contaminated) ground. Viewed holistically, and as a practical matter, the CoA is not final because the developer cannot build until the LPC grants a final approval, and the CoA is only a provisional approval"

NO.71 \nPetitioners claim that the CoA is causing immediate, concrete harm because they will (or at least may) have to challenge the project in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (\"ULURP\"), because property values will fluctuate, because anxiety will increase, because decisions will have to be made under short deadlines, etc. However, as respondents argue, none of these are legally cognizable injuries. Any ULURP opposition is discretionary, and life is full of uncertainty not giving rise to causes of action. \nThe 800-pound gorilla in the room, at least in petitioner's room, is the well-known Beacon Theater case, which found that a provisional approval was not final, and which is practically on all fours with the instant case. Comm. to Save the Beacon Theater by Meltzer v City of New York, 146 AD2d 397, 404 (1st Dep't 1989. Petitionersâ€™ attempts to distinguish it are unconvincing, and the developer's reply demolishes them. \nFinally, petitioner's creative request to convert the instant proceeding into a declaratory judgment action is unavailing because any such action would suffer from the same infirmity, addressed herein, as the instant proceeding, to wit, lack of finality. \nThus, the clerk is hereby directed to enter judgment denying and dismissing the instant proceeding, without prejudice to a future challenge to a final Certificate of Appropriateness from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, if, that is, the Commission ever issues one."
