Defendant's tenancy is governed by the Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, Chapter 83, Fla. Stat., Part II. \n6. The Notice attached to the Complaint is defective for the following reasons: \na.A Three-Day Notice for non-payment of rent must demand the precise amount due from the tenant and failure to do so renders the notice defective and legally insufficient to support an action for eviction. See Baker v. Clifford-Matthew Inv. Co., 128 So. 827 (Fla. 1930); Peninsular Real Estate v. Juan and Bethzaida Granizo, 6, Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 292a (Dade Cty. 1999); Koster v. Cornado, 16 Fla L.

Miami-Dade Cty. 2009).   \nc. The Notice is vague and fails to provide the tenant with enough specificity to adequately prepare a defense. Tacolcy Garden Walk v. Navarro, 17 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 36b (Fla. Miami-Dade Cty. 2009); Winter Haven Housing Authority v. Wampler, 24 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 70a (Fla. Polk Cty.2016). \n7.  The service of a proper, non-defective termination notice is a statutory condition precedent to the filing of an eviction action. See Investment and Income Realty v. Bentley, 480 So. 2d 219, 220 (Fla. $5^{\\mathrm{th}}$ DCA1985). \n8. A statutory cause of action cannot be commenced until Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent. See Ferry Morse Seed Co. v. Hitchcock, 426 So.2d 958 (Fla. 1983). \n9. A proper and non-defective notice is a statutory condition precedent and the service of a defective notice by the Plaintiff gives the Court no power to grant a landlord relief based on the defective notice and therefore this case should be dismissed. \n# \n10. Defendant's tenancy is a subsidized tenancy governed by the Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, Chapter 83, Part I. \n11. Plaintiff's Notice demanded that Defendant cure the alleged noncompliance.   \n12. Defendant was prepared to cured any lease violation by the deadline."
