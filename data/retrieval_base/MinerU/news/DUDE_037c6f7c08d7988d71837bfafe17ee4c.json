        "text": "TO YOUR HEALTH \nUSDA Employees located in the Merchandise Mart Building: Are you familiar with the services available in the Health Unit? The Health Unit was formerly referred to as the \"First-Aid\" or \"Emergency Room. Now we prefer to think of it as the \"Health Unitt and more emphasis is placed on Health Care。 Of course, first-aid treat-- ment of even minor wounds is still important and accidents should be reported promptly。 \nThe actual treatment of illnesses is limited since we do not have a physician directly in charge. However, authorization is given for the administration of simple medication for the alleviation of some minor symptoms and disorders. You are advised to come to the Health Unit when symptoms of a cold or sore throat begin。 Early treatment might prevent serious developments. \nSimple medications are available for mild stomach upsets or indigestion, but remember: Such symptoms can, also, indicate more serious involvements. If you have fever or other symptoms of importance, you may be advised to consult your physician. \nHypodermic injections of medications, such as vitamins, may be given upon written authorization from your physician. A special form may be obtained from the Health Unit for this purpose, \nIf your doctor advises temporary rest during the day following major surgery or an extended illness, you may, with the approval of your supervisor, rest in the Health Unit for a period not in excess of one hour. \nWe suggest that you report to the Health Unit if you have had a serious illness or have some existing ailment. It would be helpful to have a record of your condition and the name of your physician in case you should become ill at work and need immediate assistance. \nTo ALL USDA EMPLOYEES: The USDA Club is still offering Polio Vaccine injections through the Health Unit. If you still have not received the series of three injections, you are urged to contact the murse, ExT. 842。 \n\\*\\*米\n# \n\"Accidents Will Happen!\" is a familiar statement and an accident did happen in editing the USDA Club News last issue。 T The SAFETY NOTE was not completed so we shall repeat: Be a good office \"housekeeper!l and prevent accidents. Serious falls can result from such articles as rubber bands, paper clips, or even a slip of paper lying on the floor. Also, coffee or other liquids spilled should be wiped up immediately. Watch these minor things and prevent major accidents. \n# \nA man unable to choose between two evils, often hunts up a third. \nPREXY'S CORNER \nAt the January Meeting USDA Club Officers it wa decided that the latter part of March there shou.l be a general meeting of : USDA Members. Time and place of this stated mee? ing, as of the date of tl: paper, has not been estal lished nor has a guest speaker been obtained。 committees are at work or the project and all membes will be notified in ample time so that we may expec $100\\%$ attendance in the Dallas Area. \nIt is with much regret that the Compliance and Investigation Division of CSS reports the retiremen' of two of its members of the investigative staff\\* James P.
