But that number could not be confirmed, and two doctors at a hospital in the area gave slightly lower totals. Gaza health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants when reporting casualties. \n# \n# \nPARIS — Let’s say you learned to tell time on a simple, round analog clock, with 12 big numbers and two hands. The Olympic Games present a mind-bending puzzle: What if, between each of those big numbers, there were scores of smaller numbers? And what if, between the smaller numbers, there were hundreds more numbers? \nThat’s what clocks look like — what time looks like — to a lot of Olympic athletes, whose success or failure is defined by cruelly tiny increments. The American sprinter Noah Lyles won the men’s 100- meter dash by 0.005 of a second. If he had been slower by a blink of an eye, generally accepted to last one-tenth of a second, he would have finished seventh. \n\nSpeed, of course, is part of competing. We talk about the best times, the time to beat. But minutes contain an infinite number of fractions a human brain can struggle to comprehend. \nKenny Bednarek of the United States won a silver medal after running the 200 in 19.62 seconds; Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won gold by finishing 0.16 of a second faster. \nThose hundredths of a second are truly microscopic, but they created a huge difference in the experience of the two men: Tebogo won his country’s first Olympic gold medal ever. Bednarek mulled what he could have done better. \n“I know this is not my best race,” he said after “settling” for the silver medal. “At practice, I Continued on Page 6 \nBRIDGE TO THE PAST The Pont du Carrousel has come to symbolize joy.

But it questioned the Gaza authorities’ statements, saying that its own assessment of the incident was at odds with the reported death toll. \nThe Civil Defense emergency service said that the strike hit as more than 200 people gathered before sunrise in a prayer hall to worship. More than 2,000 displaced people had been staying at the shelter, the Al-Tabaeen school in the Al-Daraj neighborhood, the \nContinued on Page 8 \n# \nOnce the home of the Hawaiian Kingdom’s royalty, Lahaina’s shores over the centuries became a stop for whalers plundering the seas, for missionaries spreading \nLAHAINA, Hawaii — Across nine generations, Archie Kalepa’s family has seen the waterfront in Lahaina, a town on the island of Maui, undergo repeated transformation. \nthe Christian gospel, for plantation owners who opened canneries to prepare their bounty of pineapples for export. More recently, tourists packed high-end galleries and shoreline restaurants that offered sunset meals of ahi tuna and taro. \nRelics of each of those layers of history were turned to ash a year ago, when an Aug. 8 inferno roared through Lahaina, killing at least 102 people. Now, as the task of rebuilding begins, Mr. Kalepa, a community leader who has organized recovery efforts, is siding with many of those who see a chance to prioritize the town’s deeper history over the economic interests that have dominated for decades. \n\nThat would mean doing what for many has seemed unthinkable until now: transforming the waterfront by peeling back history, removing some of the gift shops, restaurants and beachwear bouContinued on Page 14 \n# \nAllies Rattled by Rants and Self-Sabotage \n# \nBOOST FOR DEMOCRATS \n# \nThe Aug. 2 dinner at the Bridgehampton, N.Y., home of Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive, was a high-powered affair. Among the roughly 130 people who dined under an airconditioned tent were some of Donald J. Trump’s wealthiest supporters, including the billionaire hedge-fund financier Bill Ackman, who sat next to the former president, and Omeed Malik, the president of another fund, 1789 Capital. \nSome guests hoped Mr. Trump would signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes. He did not. \nBefore the dinner, answering a question that voiced concerns about the upcoming election during a small round-table discussion inside Mr. Lutnick’s house, Mr. Trump said, “We’ve got to stop the steal,” reviving yet again his false claims about the 2020 election — claims that his advisers have urged him to drop because they don’t help him with swing voters. According to two people present, Mr. Trump himself also brought up his remark, made two days earlier at a gathering of the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he had questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity. \nIt had been a display of flagrant race-baiting that was egregious even by Mr. Trump’s standards, and it instantly reprogrammed America’s TV news chyrons: He falsely claimed that Ms. Harris had only recently decided to identify as Black for political purposes. But Mr. Trump showed no regret. “I think I was right,” he told the rattled donors that night. Later, at dinner under the tent, Harrison LeFrak, the scion of a New York real-estate family, whose father is an old friend of Mr. Continued on Page 20 \n\nBut She Is Trailing Trump on the Economy and Immigration \n# \nWhile the reshaped race is still in its volatile early weeks, Democrats are now in a notably stronger position in these three battleground states that have long been key to the party’s victories — or defeats. Still, the results show vulnerabilities for Ms. Harris. Voters prefer Mr. Trump when it comes to whom they trust to handle the economy and immigration, issues that remain central to the presidential race. \nMs. Harris’s numbers are an upswing for Democrats from Mr. Biden’s performance in those states, even before his much-maligned debate showing that destabilized his candidacy. In May, Mr. Biden was virtually tied with Mr. Trump \nMs. Harris is ahead of Mr. Trump by four percentage points in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, 50 percent to 46 percent among likely voters in each state. The surveys were conducted from Aug. 5 to 9. \nVice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald J. Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new surveys by The New York Times and Siena College, the latest indication of a dramatic reversal in standing for Democrats after President Biden’s departure from the presidential race remade it. \nThe polls, some of the first highquality surveys in those states since Mr. Biden announced he would no longer run for re-election, come after nearly a year of surveys that showed either a tied contest or a slight lead for Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden. \nContinued on Page 19 \n# \n# \nBELZONI, Miss. — The last day Byron Stribling spent with his wife, Harmony, was the Fourth of July in 2021. A great day, he always says. \nThe holiday fell on a Sunday. The congregation at their church in Belzoni, a small town in the Mississippi Delta, blessed the couple and prayed for a safe delivery for Ms. Ball-Stribling. She was eight months pregnant and scheduled to have a C-section five days later. At a barbecue, the Striblings feasted on ribs, collard greens, potato salad and cornbread. But around midnight, Ms. Ball-Stribling threw up and said her chest hurt. “She wanted to lay down, but I told her, ‘We need to go somewhere,’” Mr. Stribling, 32, recalled. \nAmbulances in the Delta are unreliable, and the only hospital in Belzoni closed over a decade ago. So they piled into his car and sped toward Yazoo City, Miss., the closest town with an emergency room, about 30 miles away. \nOn the way, Ms. Ball-Stribling had a seizure. Panicked, Mr. Stribling called 911. The dispatcher told Mr. Stribling to pull over and start CPR, so he slammed on the brakes and pumped her chest on the side of the road until an ambulance \n\nRORY DOYLE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Harmony Ball-Stribling’s cause of death was pre-eclampsia.

The death certificate says the cause of death was complications of pre-eclampsia, a lifethreatening blood pressure disorder that can develop during pregnancy, exacerbated by hypertension and hardening of the arteries. But that’s not the whole story. \nBecause even though Ms. BallStribling was just 30, married and had health insurance, the odds Continued on Page 12"
