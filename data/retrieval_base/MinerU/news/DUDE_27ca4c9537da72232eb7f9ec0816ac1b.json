Terry's Rangers of the Eighth Texas Cavalry, C.S.A, was re. hearsing a big scene at Six Flags Sunday. The Rangers formerly caught a Yankee spy.and executed him. \nSome.yisiting Yankees winced at. seeing one of·their own get it, however. So, the outfit is getting a new script. It calls for the liquidation of a. Rebel deserter. \nGarrett.won the big role. Col. Mark Lamkin, 22, called his troopers together, They were dressed in something close to Confederateuniformsbut they've switched their former gray wool for tropical worsted.

Everybody does a double-take when he marches by. \n\"'I'm a true-blooded Negro but I say if you can't beat em, join 'em,” he grinned. \nMickey and the others are members ofASC'sROTC marching unit, the Jody Drill Team.

Little kids flock up to enlist. The,general signs the boys into the Confederate Army and the glrls into the. Nurse Corps. Then he shows them how to do right face and left face. \nGarrett was still a litle. vague about which battle he deserted as the firing squad assembled. The script hasn't been com. pleted.As a soldier-ripped open his tunic, the firing sguad shouldered their Slarps rifles. \n\n\"Ready! .... Aim! ...\" shouted the colonel. The crowd was pressing up.Everybody was.still. \nYou could hear a firing pin drop, \nBalooey! \nSmoke blew,riflemen flinched, little kids put their fingers. in their ears and Terry's Rangers marched off with a hole in their wnnirn"
