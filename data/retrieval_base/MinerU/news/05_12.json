In a conversation bristling with tension on Feb. 11, the president warned the prime minister against a major assault on the Gaza city of Rafah — and suggested that continued U.S. support would depend on how Israel proceeded. \nEVACUATIONS New Israeli orders will force perhaps 300,000 Gazans to find shelter again.

PAGE 8 \nAt that point, the president headed down a road that would lead to the most serious collision between the United States and Israel in a generation. Three months later, the president has decided to follow through on his warning, leaving the two sides in a dramatic standoff. Mr. Biden has paused a shipment of 3,500 bombs and vowed to block the delivery of other offensive arms if Israel mounts a full-scale ground invasion of Rafah over his objections. \nSix days later, on Feb. 17, Mr. Biden heard from Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. The president’s chief diplomat was calling from his blue-and-white government plane as he was flying home from a security conference in Munich. Despite the president’s warning, Mr. Blinken reported that momentum for an invasion of Rafah was building. It could result in a humanitarian catastrophe, he feared. They had to draw a line. \nIt was an extraordinary moment. For the first time, the president who had so strongly backed Israel’s war against Hamas was essentially threatening to change course. The White House, however, kept the threat secret, making no mention of it in the official statement it released about the call. And indeed, the private warning, perhaps too subtle, fell on deaf ears. \nHe Warned Against Raid on Rafah for Months \n# \nContinued on Page 10 \n# \nBy JESUS JIMÉNEZ For decades, Munch’s Make Believe Band at Chuck E.

If you would like to learn more about Jesus Christ,” he says to the camera in Spanish, “contact me.” \nThe first write-off came on Mr. Trump’s tax return for 2008. With sales lagging far behind projections, he claimed that his investment in the condo-hotel tower met the tax code definition of “worthless,” because his debt on the project meant he would never see a profit. That move resulted in Mr. Trump reporting losses as high as \\$651 million for the year, The Times and ProPublica found. \nThere is no indication the I.R.S. challenged that initial claim, though that lack of scrutiny surprised tax experts consulted for this article. But in 2010, Mr. Trump and his tax advisers sought to extract further benefits from the Chicago project, executing a maneuver that would draw years of inquiry from the I.R.S. First, he shifted the company that owned the tower into a new partnership. Because he controlled both companies, it was like moving coins from one pocket to another. Then he used the shift as justification to declare \\$168 million in additional losses over the next decade. \nThe faith, long known for sending tens of thousands of neatly and formally dressed young people across the globe each year to \nFormer President Donald J.

It is his first week as a missionary, but today, instead of approaching people on the street, he is shooting a video that he will later post to social media. \nBut when Mr. Trump sought to reap tax benefits from his losses, the I.R.S. has argued, he went too far and in effect wrote off the same losses twice. \nThe 92-story, glass-sheathed skyscraper along the Chicago River is the tallest and, at least for now, the last major construction project by Mr. Trump. Through a combination of cost overruns and the bad luck of opening in the teeth of the Great Recession, it was also a vast money loser. \nThe coronavirus pandemic forced hundreds of Chuck E. Cheese locations to shutter, and the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the summer of 2020. Since then, its leaders have tried to adapt Chuck E.

A first, partial revelation of the substance of the audit came in 2020, when The Times reported that the I.R.S. was disputing $\\mathfrak{a}\\$72.9$ million tax refund that Mr. Trump had claimed starting in 2010. That refund, which aping his presidency, the I.R.S. undertook a high-level legal review before pursuing it.
