Bromwich, Maggie Haberman and JonathanSwan. \nHer voice low, her posture tense, the woman who spent years steering Donald J. Trump through strife and scandal stepped to the witness stand on Friday carrying a different burden. She was there under the fluorescent lights of a dreary Manhattan courtroom, seated 15 feet from the former president she once fiercely defended, to testify at his criminal trial. \n\"I'm really nervous,’ Hope Hicks, the onetime Trump spokeswoman, messaging maestro and all-around adviser, acknowledged to the prosecutor questioning her, declaring what was already obvious to the riveted courtroom. \nMs. Hicks's unease came to a head hours later as Mr. Trump's lawyer began to cross-examine her —- and she began to cry As her voice cracked, Mr. Trump locked his eyes on her. \nThe question that initially unnerved Ms. Hicks was about her time at the Trump Organization, the family's business, where she had fond memories of working. Ms. Hicks left the stand, and the trial paused so that she could compose herself. She returned minuteslatertocontinuehertestimony, occasionally dabbing her eyes with a tissue. \nThe striking show of emotion reflected Ms. Hicks's discomfort with testifying against a man who launched her career and entrusted her with his reputation. \nDOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES Donald J. Trump at one point locked eyes on his ex-press aide. \nEach time the questioning conjured up another memory of working for Mr. Trump — at his company, on his campaign and finally in his White House — Ms. Hicks appeared to fight back tears. \nMs. Hicks, who fell out of favor with Mr. Trump once it emerged that she had privately voiced anger at the Jan.6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, said in her testimony that they had not spoken in nearly two years. \nMr. Trump, who faces up to four years in prison if convicted, is on trial for 34 felony charges of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star. The case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office, is the \nContinued on Page A19 \nLAM YIK FEI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \nIn Taiwan, a Spectacle Grounded in Spirituality Elaborate pirimage rMazu ea godess, were oncedminatedbylerelebt are atracting younger audienc.Pae. \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON —Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat in a crucial swing district, and his wife were charged with participating in a yearslong \\$600,000 bribery scheme involving Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank, according to a federal indictment unsealed in Houston on Friday. \nThe accusations against Mr. Cuellar, 68, and his wife Imelda, 67, center on allegations of bribery and money laundering in connection with their efforts on behalf of an oil and gas company owned by Azerbaijan's leaders as well as an unnamed bank based in Mexico City, according to the 54-page complaint. \nMr. Cuellar, a Laredo native first elected in 2004, is also accused of acting as an agent of a foreign entity while a U.S. government official - by delivering a speech favoring Azerbaijan in Congress and inserting provisions into aid bills to benefit those who were paying bribes to his family. The government claimed that Mr. Cuellar, who once served as Texas secretary of state, was paid toback legislation intended to stymie regulation of the payday loan industry, which has been accused of predatory lending practices against the poor. He also tried to weaken money laundering laws that affected Mexico's banking sector, according to prosecutors. \nContinued on Page A17 \n# \n# \nAfter firing about 10,000 mortar rounds during four years of training, one soldier who joined the Army with near-perfect scores on the military aptitude test was struggling to read or do basic math. \nAnother soldier started having unexplained fits in which his internal sense of time would suddenly come unmoored, sending everything around him whirling in fast-forward. \nA third, Sgt.

Trying to placate both his far-right allies,who seektorebuildIsraelisettlements in Gaza, and Israel's foreign partners,who want Gaza returned to Palestinian governance, Mr. Netanyahu has stopped short of any specific declaration. \nBehind the scenes, however, senior officials in his office have been weighing an expansive plan for postwar Gaza, in which Israel would offer to share oversight of the territory with an alliance of Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the United States, according to three Israeli officials and five people who have discussed the plan with members of the Israeli government. \nFar-right members of Mr. Netanyahu's coalition are almost certain to dismiss such an idea, and so are the Arabcountries mentioned as possible participants. But it is the clearest sign yet that officials at the highest levels of Israel's government are thinking about Gaza's postwar future, despite saying little in public, and could be a starting point in future negotiations. \nThe disclosure comes against the backdrop of intense international efforts to get Israel and Hamastoagreetoacease-firethat could become a permanent truce, and it follows growing pressure on Israel to plan for what comes next! Israel's reluctance to determine how to govern Gaza has created a powervacuum in much of the territory, leading to lawlessness and worsening the direhumanitarian situation. \nArab officials and analysts have called the power-sharing plan unworkable because it does not create an explicit path toward a Palestinian state, which the Emirati and Saudi governments have said is a prerequisite for their involvement in postwar planning. But others have cautiously welcomed the proposal because it at least suggests greater  flexibility among Israeli leaders than their public statements indicate. \nUnder the proposal, the ArabIsraeli alliance, working with the United States, would appoint Gazan leaders to redevelop the devastated territory, overhaul its education system and maintain \nAccording to that proposal, Israel would do so in exchange for normalized relations between itself and Saudi Arabia, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \n# \nLOUISVILLE, Ky. － In the world according to Mike Repole, everyone involved in horse racing is a dummy. Except him, Mike from Queens or the Commish, as some of his followers on X call him. \nStuart S. Janney IHI, chairman of the nonprofit Jockey Club, is clueless and tone-deaf and has run the sport into the ground, Repole says. Churchill Downs Inc., which hosts the Kentucky Derby, is cheap: The \\$5 million purse for America's most famous race should be much more, and the racetrack treats Repole and other owners badly. \n\nForget about John Stewart, a new owner bringing fresh energy and big money into the game. He is “arrogant, free-spending” and such a rube that he has an “\\$8 haircut.\" \n\nAll the above, and many others, are among Repole's frequent targets on social media and various podcasts.
