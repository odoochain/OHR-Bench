        "text": "# \navy Medicine’s motto: “World-class care ... anytime, anywhere” exemplifies not only our dedication to provide care at home, but also how we provide health care when we operate forward. We provide care above the sea, below the sea, on the sea, on the battlefield and in our homeports. Whether you are an independent duty corpsman deployed with the Marines or a Navy researcher developing vaccines in one of our labs across the globe, you play a significant role in Navy Medicine’s forward mission. \nT his month, I would like to highlight how Navy Medicine is operating forward and the significant advancements we are making to support those we serve. In our current environment, we need to remain vigilant to meet our mission. We must keep our skills fresh and anticipate what may be on the horizon. \nPerhaps more so than any other Navy Medicine personnel, our independent duty corpsmen understand what it means to operate forward. T hey do amazing work to ensure we meet our forwarddeployed mission. T hey are the essence of Navy Medicine. T hey are leaders and teachers to those they serve with, and in many cases, perform their jobs in the most austere of environments. \nAviation is a key element of operating forward, and aviation medicine is on \n# \n# \nVice Adm.

Kremer MEDNEWS Managing Editor \nU.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery 7700 Arlington Blvd. Ste. 5122 Falls Church, Va. 22042-5122 \nPublic Affairs Office p - 703-681-9032 \nthe cutting edge, especially in the field of Human Systems Integration. Our aircraft manned and unmanned, are faster than ever. We are seeing a complex combination of a highly technical machine paired with an equally complex human operator. When the pilot cannot physically keep up with the machine, due to G- forces, for instance, adjustments are made to the design. Our flight surgeons or aerospace medicine specialists understand the limitations of the pilot and recognize problems early on in the development of an aircraft and make mitigating recommendations to the designers. It is truly remarkable. \nWe are also breaking the glass ceiling in Navy Medicine by changing the way we use aviation physician assistants — a program that has been used for decades by our Army counterparts with resounding success. For the first time, we have an aviation PA assigned to Carrier Air Wing Five in Japan serving in a flight surgeon billet. T he PA provides clinical care for aviators in such areas as otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat), ophthalmology, internal medicine, neurology, and psychiatry, just like the flight surgeon. This has allowed our flight surgeons to focus on improving the training in human factors for their aviators, in addition to the care they provide every day. T he Naval Aerospace Medical Institute is also in the process of developing a curriculum which would allow a PA to gain the clinical knowledge necessary to provide aeromedical care for our aviators. \nAnother way we operate forward is through undersea medicine. Navy Medicine is currently taking a multi-pronged approach to address the medical and psychological causes of unplanned personnel losses in our submarine force. T hese losses can be due to a variety of reasons including medical, disciplinary, pregnancy, family care, and honorable discharge. We are also streamlining the Undersea Warfare physical waiver and disqualification request package administrative handling, moving towards an all-electronic system. All of these advancements by our undersea medical professionals, researchers, and support staff allow the Navy Medicine undersea mission to continue \n\n# \neffectively and intelligently \nLast month, the Secretary of Defense announced immediate rescission of the 1994 Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule. T his change will result in openings previously closed to women — positions already changing with superb women Sailors on our submarines.  Navy Medicine anticipates and, as always, will provide women’s health care in support of our military’s forward mission. We are already providing necessary resources concerning pregnancy and parenthood for our Navy and Marine Corps personnel. T he Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center’s Sexual Health and Responsibility Program is focusing on the prevention of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and providing critical resources for all our Sailors. Navy Medicine also released a policy in December 2012 mandating active duty and Reserve female Sailors receive counseling on contraception services upon receiving orders to operational duty. In addition, we are intensifying our efforts for better awareness of these issues for both men and women. T hese programs and guidance support our mission readiness and accomplishment, minimizing avoidable health care costs and personnel losses, morbidity and mortality, and support a better quality of life. \nIn all, the work that each and every one of you does each day has an impact on how we successfully operate forward. Regardless of where we are, deployed or at home, we all come together to make the mission happen. \nI am extremely proud to be your shipmate. T hank you for your service and as always, it is my honor and my privilege to be your surgeon general."

Jason Reid, USNH Yokosuka Multi-Service Unit division o f ficer and course facilitator. “T hey have a lot of book knowledge, and this course builds on that by giving them hands-on skills. T his is kind of a refresher for a lot of the things they learned. We take it up one more step by physically doing the things they learn about.” \nT he students work with a state-of-the-art teaching tool called SimMan. SimMan is a high-tech mannequin that reacts just like a real patient. Students are able to check its pulse, blood pressure and listen to changes in its tone of voice. \n“T he training was very helpful,” said Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Weiran Wang. “It reinforced what we learned in ‘A’ School. Taking a closer look at the fundamentals makes us better [hospital] corpsmen which allows us to better serve our patients and the fleet\" \nThe course also allowed students to build their self-confidence. \n“You have to be comfortable with your patients,” said Reid. \nPhoto by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Josh Curtis ,Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Resielyn Jose instructs Hospital Corpsman Rosanna Torres on how to ensure a syringe is free of air bubbles during a Hospitalman Skills Basic Course at U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Feb. 14. The goal of the course is to provide corpsmen with fundamental knowledge of the five key aspects of health care. \n“T his course gave them the opportunity to work with a simulated patient and evaluate themselves. It allowed them to hone the skills they need as [hospital] corpsmen.” \nUSNH Yokosuka is the largest U.S. military treatment facility on mainland Japan. T he hospital provided 233, 308 total outpatient visits in 2012. \n# \nDuring the ceremony Force Master Chief Sherman Boss, BUMED and director of the Hospital Corps, addressed the five finalists, adding he couldn't be more proud of them because they are the Navy’s future. \n“What you represent is pretty astounding,” said Boss.” T here are about 4,800 first class petty officers, and you are the best five. We look to you to be the future of Navy Medicine.” \nTarkowski enlisted in the Navy in May 1987 and served with distinction for 10 years, earning numerous qualifications and deployed in support of Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm and Southern Watch. Tarkowski was honorably discharged in 1997 and returned to his hometown to pursue a career in law enforcement. \nIn 2002, then Sgt. Tarkowski joined the Kansas Army National Guard and between 2005-2006 deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). In \n2006, he returned to active duty with the Navy, attended hospital corpsmen “A” school and deployed with the 1st Marines Division in support of OIF. While at his current assignment at Walter Reed he deployed in June 2011 as an individual augmentee supporting a provincial reconstruction team in Uruzgan, Afghanistan and returned in March 2012. \n“I enjoy serving, being a corpsman, deploying and taking care of Soldiers, Marines, and Airmen.” said Tarkowski. “It has always been a passion, but my true love is to take care of Sailors.” \nTarkowski added that his interest in medicine stemmed from his mother being a civilian nurse. \n“T he U.S. Army taught me what I could be,” said Tarkowski, “but the Navy continues to show me that I can be much more than I ever dreamed.” \nThe five petty officer 1st class finalists went before the SOY Board for evaluation of their educational accomplishments, physical fitness standards, participation in civic and community activities, along with a variety of rigorous tests of professional military knowledge, leadership, military bearing, Navy values and current events. \n\nThis year's finalists are Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Jonathon T.

        "text": "# \nBy Douglas H. Stutz, Naval Hospital Bremerton Public Affairs \nBREMERTON, Wash. - Naval Hospital Bremerton is actively promoting the Great American Spit-Out (GASpO) Feb. 21, by having users pledge to go tobaccofree for that one day. \nNHB’s GASpO campaign is being spearheaded by the command’s tobacco cessation facilitator and Health Promotion department, and is part of ‘Quit Tobacco-Make Everyone Proud, a Department of Defense on-going educational campaign tailored specifically for the U.S military to give up tobacco products. \n“We hope users use this day to make a commitment to stop their habit,” said Patrick W. Graves, NHB tobacco cessation facilitator. “Chewing tobacco is a dangerous concept with definite health risks. Putting chewing tobacco into a mouth instantly exposes a user to significant dangers such as throat cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophagus cancer, stomach cancer and colon cancer. T here are 28 cancercausing carcinogens in a dip of chew. Smokeless tabacco is known to cause gum disease, tooth decay and heart disease.” \nAccording to Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center (NMCPHC) Health Promotion and Wellness Department, smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to smoking. A National Cancer Institute study states that chew/dip is just as addictive and contains more nicotine than cigarettes. \nGraves attests that chewing tobacco is really a super concentrated form of nicotine, equal to three and a half packs of cigarettes. “T hat makes it all the more addictive,” he said, citing compiled Department of Defense statistics that show chewing tobacco is used by 19 percent of 18- to 24-year-old military males, approximately twice the national average. “Chewing tobacco is not a safe alternative to smoking because the body absorbs three to four times more nicotine, making it potentially more addictive than cigarettes.” \nGraves advocates that the benefits far outweigh the risks when it comes to quitting a habit like smokeless tobacco. \nNMCPHC notes that quitting smokeless tobacco can positively impact any former-user, from giving them personal hygienic changes of brighter teeth and fresher breath, to professionally improving their readiness with increased endurance due to better lung capacity, less injuries and less time off due to illness. Quitting can even enhance night vision. \nOn top of reducing danger from cancer, there are also financial incentives involved. Quitting can save a smokeless tobacco user money. A person can even calculate how much savings by using the Department of Defense cost savings calculator. \n“If there is a person out there who is using dip and/or smoking and is thinking about quitting, now is the best time,” said Graves. “If they are experiencing symp\n# \n\\* Write down your reasons for quitting and keep them on hand at all times. A good tip is to consider keeping them in the pocket that was used to store a can of chew. \n\\* Pick a date and work backwards to get that start date. It is recommended that a user begins to taper tobacco use two to four weeks prior to the actual tobaccofree date. \n\\* Identify the triggers from using any tobacco product, and how the user can cope when the craving hits. \n\\* Enlist the help of family and friends for support. \nTry replacing smokeless tobacco with a healthy alternative, such as sunflower seeds, toothpicks or sugar-free gum/candy. \n\\* Change up the routine.

Daniel Hosack, Marine Barracks Washington, 8th and I \nWASHINGTON – A native of South Amboy, N.J., is helping to save the lives of Marines by sharing his skills as a corpsman. \nNavy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Michael Pappas, one of three Navy corpsmen stationed at Marine Barracks Washington, taught the Combat Lifesaver Course to 30 Marines, Jan. 31. T he course teaches critical battlefield first aid techniques designed to save the lives of Marines injured in combat. \nT he three-day course gives Marines the hands-on instruction needed to provide lifesaving first aid in combat. T hey learned how to identify burns, treat bone fractures and wounds, and attend to other common battlefield injuries. T he Marines also learned how to apply a tourniquet and open an airway, and they  were taught how to evacuate fellow injured Marines off the battlefield. \n$^{\\mathrm{{\\scriptsize{c}}}_{\\mathrm{{I}}}}$ think it’s a great course, because it teaches the Marines to take care of each other if something happens to one of them,” Pappas said. \nPappas, who served in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, said he believes the three-day course was time well spent, and that the skills taught in the course increase the probability of Marines returning home if injured in combat. \nU.S. Marine Corps photo by Pfc. Dan Hosack Navy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Michael Pappas explains to Marines how to properly apply a bandage on a wound during a Combat Lifesaver Course at Marine Barracks Washington, D.C., Jan. 31. \n\n“A course like this one is vital, because it increases the amount of Marines we can get back alive to their families,” said Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Charles Barbarick, a corpsman who taught the course with Pappas. “Our role is to ensure the well-being of mind, body and spirit of all our Marines.” \nIn his regular duties, Pappas is responsible for the medical care and the overall health and wellness of the Marines he serves with, as well as the management of the unit’s “sick call,” the military’s equivalent of an urgent care center. \nPappas said he plans on staying in the Navy and entering the Navy Nurse Corps. \n# \nwaiting for. If they are holding out for some worst-case scenario, it’s already taken place. T he dangers of chewing tobacco are subtle.” \nGraves is convinced that as a whole, Navy and Marine Corps personnel tend to be better informed than the general public about the inherent dangers of tobacco usage. But getting the information out is part of the continual challenge in reminding users of the hidden threat. \n“It’s up to the individual and their action and behavior,” said Graves. “We know more. We also tend to smoke and dip 35 to 50 percent more than our civilian counterparts. It’s always been a cultural thing in the service. We are gradually changing that.” \n“Using chewing tobacco is completely contradictory to anyone who puts in the time to keep up with their readiness, training and physical fitness” said Graves. “Then they go and use smokeless tobacco which takes away from their gains. GASpO is one of the many ways a person can start the process of quitting.” \nNHB, Branch Health Clinic Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Branch Health Clinic Bangor, and Branch Health Clinic Everett Dental staff are also proactive in educating and reminding personnel on the health risks associated with chewing tobacco. \n“Our partners in the dental community tend to see the impact of what chewing tobacco can do a lot earlier that I do,”  said Graves. “One of the signs is a pre-cancerous lesion. Our dentists and dental technicians are really good at recognizing something like that and then sharing with the patient about the potential problem.” \nGraves encourages anyone who is thinking of quitting cigarettes or chewing/smokeless tobacco to contact their primary care doctor, unit/ship/boat corpsman, or NHB’s Tobacco Cessation Facilitator o f fice. \nCall your TRICARE regional quit line. All non-Medicare- eligible beneficiaries can receive assistance with smoking cessation through the TRICARE® toll-free Smoking Quitline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including weekends and holidays."

It speeds up the process of transitioning limited duty personnel by getting all of the players involved in the various stages of a patient's case working together, from the patient's physicians at the beginning to Veterans Affairs (VA) personnel who determine disability ratings at the end. \nMitchell noted that cooperation and collaboration with the Hampton VA are an integral part of the program's success; the VA staff is just across the hallway, whereas in other facilities, the VA is in a separate location. \nT he faster turnaround also helps the Navy and the Marine Corps with manpower management and fleet readiness. T he faster an ill or injured member can be released from an operational billet, the quicker that billet can be flled by a replacement. T hat also applies to service members returning to full-duty status. According to Mitchell, they return about 100 Sailors and Marines to full duty every month. \nBy ensuring the highest quality of health care, the full and e f ficient use of NMCP's services, and working closely with Navy and Marine Corps commands, Medical Boards' accomplishments demonstrates well Navy Medicine's goals of readiness, value and jointness. \n\"We all have different parts of the process to complete, so everyone doing their part is how we are able to achieve the pipeline award,\" said Williams. \nFebruary 2013  MEDNEWS  7"

Establishing a virtual presence through a medium that most people utilize is just another tool Navy Medicine and corpsmen can use to support each \nother, the Force Master Chief added. \nNavy Medicine applauds Force Master Chief's effort and encourages its other leaders to follow. \n“Navy Medicine is a global force and with social media, it allows us to extend and share our communication efforts directly with those we serve and support.” said Capt. Dora Lockwood, director, BUMED public affairs. \nNavy Medicine uses a wide range of social media resource including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, as well as the Navy Medicine Live blog. T hey are accessible from various platforms including mobile devices making it possible to access this information and communicate with our personnel stateside and deployed. \n“I encourage my Sailors, no matter [their] rank, to provide constructive feedback and discussions on our goals, policies, mission, specialties, and career development [as well as] how we can best meet our current and future challenges,” said Boss. \nT he Navy Medicine Force Master Chief Facebook page is accessible at: https:// www.facebook.com/USNavyMedicineFORCM. \n# \nBy Regena Kowitz, Naval Hospital Beaufort public affairs \nBEAUFORT, S.C. - Naval Hospital Beaufort staff and beneficiaries were treated to an open house in the hospital’s Wellness Center, Feb. 14, to highlight cardiovascular health for American Heart Month. \nT he event, which was hosted by the Health Promotion Department, was designed to highlight the hospital's fitness center, which includes an aerobics area and equipment room, as well as the services available that promote a healthful lifestyle. \n\\*\"This was a great event to let our staff and patients know that we are here to promote wellness and take care of them when they are sick,” said Capt. Melanie Merrick, Naval Hospital Beau\nfort’s executive o f ficer. “We do this by helping to optimize their health by preventing disease, injury, and illness. Our Health Promotion Department provides a lot of resources to help individuals make healthier lifestyle choices, particularly when it comes to choosing heart-healthy diets and showing how fitness can be part of anyone's everyday routine? \n\nDuring the open house, Health Promotion staff sponsored a healthy dessert contest and tasting. T he entries were required to be low in fat to show that you can have your cake and eat it too when it comes to eating right. Guests were also given the opportunity to burn any extra calories gained from eating those healthy desserts with fitness demonstrations that included dance aerobics and instruction on using battle ropes — two thick ropes that provide conditioning and strength training. \n\n\n“Because this is American Hearth Month, we really wanted to focus on how people can incorporate heart-healthy foods and activities into their lives,” said Ivette Moore, health promotions coordinator. “It’s also National Condom Day, so we wanted to provide information on preventing sexually transmitted nfections and make sure condoms were ilable.” \nHospital staff also provided information about different classes and resources for helping beneficiaries lead healthier lifestyles including nutrition, tobacco essation, and weight management. \nOpen since 1949, Naval Hospital Beaufort provides general medical, surgical, and emergency services to all active duty personnel, as well as retired military and family members residing in the Beaufort area, a total population of   approximately 29,000 beneficiaries."

        "text": "# \nBy Deborah R. Kallgren, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth Public Affairs \nPORTSMOUTH, Va. – T he Scott Center Annex pharmacy began flling new prescriptions for TRICARE beneficiaries, Feb. 11. \nFor many years, the refill pharmacy has flled approximately 550,000 refill prescriptions annually, making it the largest freestanding refill center in the Navy. \nNow, after heeding customer suggestions, patrons will be able to take new prescriptions to the Scott Center Annex to be filled. \n“We are trying to improve customer service and reduce wait times at the main pharmacy at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth,” said Cmdr. Roger Bunch, assistant head of NMCP’s Pharmacy Department. \nConstruction at the Scott Center Annex pharmacy to add the capability to fll new prescriptions cost approximately $\\$100,000$ . \n“We plan on saving half a million dollars annually on prescription (costs),” said Bunch. He added that it costs the government and taxpayers more money when TRICARE beneficiaries fll their prescriptions at retail pharmacies. \nWhile the Scott Center Annex pharmacy was not enlarged to accommodate filling new prescriptions, the interior was reconfigured to add space for two new pharmacists and six additional technicians. \nT he pharmacy is located adjacent to the Commissary and Navy Exchange, making it easy for patients to drop off their prescriptions before shopping and then picking them up as they leave the base. Bunch said customers may stay and wait for their prescription to be filled, but \n\n\nPhoto by Rebecca Perron \nFrom left, Lt. Cmdr. Roger Bunch, NMCP’s Pharmacy Department assistant head; Capt.

Mark Bridenstine, Norfolk Naval Shipyard commanding officer; and Lt. David Satterthwaite, division officer and pharmacist at the Scott Center Annex pharmacy. \nthe wait time can vary. \nIn 2010, wait times were dramatically decreased when the pharmacy installed robotics that fill up to 4,500 refills per day, quickly dispensing 300 different medications. Further e f ficiencies add value by bringing beneficiaries back to military pharmacies. \nT he changes at the Scott Center Annex Pharmacy coincide with increases in prescription copays at retail pharmacies that occurred, Feb. 1. T he Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act required TRICARE to increase copays on brand name and non-formulary medications not filled at military hospitals or clinics. T here was no increase in copays for generic medications. \n\n\"Medications flled at military pharmacies have no out-of-pocket costs,” said Lt. David Satterthwaite, a pharmacist and division o f ficer at the Scott Center Annex pharmacy. “With the changes in TRICARE pharmacy copays, we hope more beneficiaries will choose to have their prescriptions filled at the Scott Center Annex pharmacy.” \nWith the new and expanded Commissary scheduled to open in May, it’s hoped the additional customers shopping for groceries will also get their prescriptions filled at the pharmacy. \n# \nNaval Medical Center San Diego staff members (standing from left to right ), Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Luis Fonseca, Jr., Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Danny Oligo, Hospitalman Ryan Ewins and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Jerred Lee, receive applause while being presented the Enlisted Superior Performer (ESP) award during the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association/U.S. Naval Institute West 2013 Conference at the San Diego Convention Center, Jan. 31.

        "text": "# \n# \nCAIRO, Egypt - To strengthen jointness with Department of Defense medical research laboratories in Africa, the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) has taken steps to establish a new relationship with the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit Kenya (USAMRU-K). \nIn October 2012, NAMRU-3 invited Lt. Col. Eyako Kofi Wurapa, director of the Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases at USAMRU-K, and Berhane Assefa, the deputy director, to visit NAMRU-3 to discuss efforts to strengthen togetherness in research and avoid duplication of efforts, thereby saving time and cost and enhancing mission readiness. \nCol. Tom Logan, USAMRU-K commanding o f ficer, reciprocated with an invitation to Capt. Buhari Oyofo, NAMRU-3 commanding o f ficer, and Lt. Cmdr. Jennifer Curry, research science director, for a follow-up visit to the USAMRU-K facilities in Kenya, Jan. 14-17. T he visit kicked off with an exchange of command briefs to better define the capabilities and current projects of the two laboratories. Other command-level interests were contract staff utilization, integration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local medical research institutions, procurement routes and \noverhead costs with an eye toward the flexibility afforded by different management structures in the face of budget uncertain\nty, travel expenditure caps and conference approval requirements. \n“T he organization of USAMRU-K was very interesting, with the headquarters embedded at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), much like the NAMRU-3 Ghana Detachment, which is embedded at the Noguchi Memorial \nFrom left: Capt. Buhari Oyofo, NAMRU-3 commanding officer, and Lt. Cmdr. Jennifer Curry, research science director, meet with Col. Tom Logan, commander, USAMRU-K. Photo by Lt. Col. Eyako Kofi Wurapa. \n# \nInstitute of Medical Research in Accra, Ghana,” said Oyofo. “I was impressed that there was no duplication of lab activities, even though there are various working sites.” \n\nOver three days, Wurapa and Assefa gave Oyofo and Curry a tour of the working sites. They first visited Kisumu, \nPhoto courtesy ofNAMRU-3 public affairs \nCapt. Buhari Oyofo NAMRU-3 commanding officer \nwhich has been active in vaccine and treatment trials for HIV and malaria. At Kisumus Kombewa Clinical Research Center there is a population\nbased cohort similar to the NAMRU-3 population-based surveillance in Damanhour, Egypt. T he nearby laboratory spaces at the Kisian complex (which also houses the largest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contingent outside of Atlanta) hold the USAMRU-K Entomology and Malaria Diagnostic/Malaria \nDrug Resistance programs. Finally, at Kericho, which is located approximately two hours from Kisumu, the NAMRU-3 team toured state-of-the-art facilities at the “Microbiology Hub” reference lab and the Kericho District Hospital laboratory. Both College of American Pathology certified labs are run under the same management, resulting in optimization of diagnostic capabilities and support. \nNAMRU-3 and USAMRU-K already partner in multi-center trials funded by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System and the Military Infectious Diseases Research Program, but hope to develop more joint protocols specific to the U.s. Africa Command (AFRICOM) region in the near future. \n“T his visit was an important step in opening up serious dialog on jointness with USAMRU-K, with NAMRU-3 looking forward to extending its role in assisting AFRICOM,” Oyofo said. \nT his initiative by both commanding officers also supports the Surgeon General's goals for jointness, value and readiness in their respective missions on the African continent."

        "text": "# \n# \nInfectious bacteria have been causing problems for military campaigns since time immemorial. At the forefront has always been diarrhea, and with every deployment or armed conflict, diarrhea has taken its toll on unit readiness and the ability to operate at ones best. \nTo counter this burden, the overseas medical research labs have been investigating and developing strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of bacterial diarrhea over the last 30 years. Due to this effort, surveillance networks have been set up to help determine the most common causes of diarrhea within our troops and which bacteria are responsible for the most severe illness worldwide. \nAt NAMRU-6, we focused on diarrhea occurring within travelers to Peru, deployed troops as part of operations New Horizons and Beyond the Horizons, and within the local populations to get a pulse on which bacteria are causing diarrhea within South America and to determine if these bacteria are developing resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat these cases. T his has become vital information in the development of countermeasures to keep our people healthy and to focus Department of Defense vaccine development efforts. \nAs part of our mission, we have been integrally involved in the preclinical trials of novel vaccines \nagainst some of the most common bacterial cause of travelers’ diarrhea. Vaccines against Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Shigella are currently under development with the assistance of the Military Infectious Disease Research Program (MIDRP) and have the potential to provide needed protec\n# \nPhoto courtesy of NAMRU-6 public affairs \nGladys Nuñez, microbiologist for NAMRU-6, performing an Immunoblot Assay looking for the presence of the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge strain as a cause of diarrhea during a pre-clinical trial using novel adhesion-based ETEC vaccines. \ntion against the morbidity associated with these common causes of diarrhea while deployed. \nAnother potential morbidity for deployed service members are wound infections. Wounds and hospital acquired infections have become more di f ficult to \ntreat in recent years due to multi-drug resistant bacteria which are harder to kill with standard \nantibiotics. As shown with recent conflicts in South-West Asia, these bacteria have complicated hospital courses for our wounded service members and have proven to be a global health threat. Given this threat, NAMRU-6 is spearheading surveillance in South America for the presence of resistant organisms with \nthe potential to cause severe hospital or wound infections. In concert with multiple military and civilian hospitals within the city of Lima, Peru and within the Amazon town of Iquitos, isolates known to cause hospital acquired infection and those associated with wound infections are collected and analyzed for the emergence of resistance and for virulence factors which make them more deadly. Through our efforts, we are beginning to fully grasp the scope of the problem and to develop strategies to counter this global health threat. \nAlthough the Bacteriology Department at NAMRU-6 is only one department in one overseas lab, it is part of a bigger system whose strength is in its connectivity to the region and its ability to form channels of communication between institution and researchers with a common goal. T hrough this teamwork, progress toward mitigating and or eliminating infectious disease threats will remain progressive."
