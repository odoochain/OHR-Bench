Or the stroke survivor who was rehospitalized following a fall after his insurer determined his rehab “could be done at home.” \nOver the course of Dr. Tariq’s 12- year career, these stories had become more common: The list of treatments that needed pre-approval from insurers seemed ever broadening, and the denials seemed ever rising. \n# \nSo in an effort to spare his patients what he deemed subpar care, and himself mountains of paperwork, Dr. Tariq recently turned to an unlikely tool: generative A.I. \nFor a growing number of doctors, A.I. chatbots — which can draft letters to insurers in seconds — are opening up a new front in the battle to approve costly claims, accomplishing in minutes what years of advocacy and attempts at health care reform have not. \n“We haven’t had legislative tools or policymaking tools or anything to fight back,” Dr. Tariq said. “This is finally a tool I can use to fight back.” \nDoctors are turning to the technology even as some of the country’s largest insurance companies face class-action lawsuits alleging that they used their own technology to swiftly deny large batches of claims and cut off seriously ill patients from rehabilitation treatment. \n“If you want to see a physician go apoplectic at a cocktail party, mention prior authorizations,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of the medicine department at the University of California, San Francisco. \nSome experts fear that the prior-authorization process will soon devolve into an A.I. “arms race,” in which bots battle bots over insurance coverage. Among doctors, there are few things as universally hated. \nThe process was designed by insurance companies to keep health care costs down by reining in doctors’ use of unnecessary and expensive treatments. \nut Dr. Jonathan Tward, a rad Continued on Page A20 \nALICE MILLIAT FOUNDATION ,The first Women’s Olympics, top and left, organized by Alice Milliat, right, took place in 1922 in Paris, drawing 77 athletes in track and field. In that era, the Summer Games were overwhelmingly male. This year’s Olympics are expected to be the first with as many female athletes as male ones. \n# \n# \nPARIS — It was 1922, two years before the last time the Olympics were held in Paris. On a warm August day, about 20,000 people came to Pershing Stadium to watch 77 athletes in track and field, including a team from the United States. There was a parade of nations. There were world records. There were 27 journalists and news coverage around the world. \nAnd at the start, a 38-year-old woman named Alice Milliat welcomed the world to Paris. She was the founder of the International Women’s Sports Federation, known in her native France as the Fédération Sportive Féminine International. \nA Fighter for Equality Gains Appreciation a Century Later \nEvery competitor that day was a woman. “I hereby declare the first female Olympic Games open,” she said. \nMilliat was making a statement that echoes today. The maledominated world of the mainline Olympics, busy preparing for the Paris Games of 1924, ignored the 1922 event, other than to complain about Milliat’s unauthorized use of “Olympics.” \nThey dismissed the rising idea that women should compete at all. \nThe 1924 Paris Games had a smattering of female athletes — 135 women out of 3,089 competitors — but the Olympics hardly welcomed their participation beyond just a few events, such as swimming and tennis. There were no women’s competitions in most sports, including track and field, soccer, rowing, cycling and even gymnastics. \nPierre de Coubertin, the founder and leader of the modern Olympics, made his attitude known repeatedly over the years. Having women in the Olympics, he said in 1912, “is impractical, uninteresting, ungainly and, I do not hesitate to add, improper.” \nBy 1928, his thoughts had not evolved. “As to the admission of women to the Games, I remain Continued on Page A9 \n# \n# \nReplacement Is Harder the Longer He Digs In \n# \nPresident Biden’s resistance to pressure to end his re-election bid appears to be a strategy aimed at running out the clock, a play to leave his party so little time to come up with another candidate that his opponents stand down. \nEvery day that Mr. Biden defies pressure to step aside, the prospects, and logistics, of replacing him become more untenable, and riskier. And the potential of weeks of Democratic infighting, as a united Republican Party nominates former President Donald J. Trump, may start to look worse than rallying behind Mr. Biden, no matter the concerns about the 81-year-old president’s health and ability to defeat Mr. Trump. \nMr. Biden’s efforts to dig in were showing signs of initial success. On Tuesday, some Democratic leaders in Congress expressed support for the president and said it was time to move on. “The urgent need right now is for Democrats to stick together and focus on the danger of Trump and his extremist agenda,” said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado. “If we do that, we will win.” \n“It’s a mess,” said James Carville, a consultant who has been among a roster of Democrats pushing for Mr. Biden to step aside and clear the way for a new nominee. “Suppose he gets what he wants. Everybody gets exhausted and just says, ‘It’s too much trouble.’” \nThe calendar is on Mr. Biden’s side. In the coming days, attention will turn to Mr. Trump, who is expected to name a running mate before his party gathers next week in Milwaukee to nominate him for a second term. Mr. Biden will be somewhat out of the public spotlight, focusing on the behind-the-scenes campaign to keep nervous Democrats in line. \nThere are 35 days between July 18, when Mr. Trump is set to accept his party’s nomination in Milwaukee, and Aug. 22, when Mr. Biden is set to accept his party’s nomination in Chicago. But the Biden campaign, work\nContinued on Page A11 \nPRESSURE BUILDS More donors and elected officials call on the president to drop out.

The United States was once deeply skeptical about whether Ukraine was ready to become a member, and while questions remain, more and more American and European officials believe that the country will eventually be able to join. \n“Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” members said in a communiqué, adding that “we will continue to \nWASHINGTON — The United States and its NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine should have an “irreversible” path to membership in the alliance, enshrining the phrase in a document that was released on Wednesday during the alliance’s summit in Washington. \nHAIYUN JIANG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Volodymyr Zelensky visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday. \nsupport it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, \nThe document does not lay out an exact timeline for membership, which the Ukrainians have wanted, but it says the allies will continue to support Ukraine’s progress on “democratic and security sector reforms.” \nU.S. and allied officials negotiated the commitments to Ukraine with new urgency, given the uncertainty over whether President Biden, a staunch opponent of Russia in its war in Ukraine, can win re-election this fall, according to officials in Washington. \nhe officials had said it was cri Continued on Page A7 \n# \n# \nSANTA FE, N.M. — Prosecutors painted Alec Baldwin as a headstrong actor who repeatedly shirked his duty to maintain gun safety on the set of his film, leading to the shooting death of its cinematographer. \nThe defense argued that it was a “tragic accident,” and that Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe that there was live ammunition in his gun, or anywhere on the set of the western “Rust.” \nMore than two years and eight months after the gun he was rehearsing with fired a fatal bullet, Mr. Baldwin found himself in a New Mexico courthouse on Wednesday standing trial on a charge of involuntary manslaughter.

Johnson, one of the prosecutors, told the jury in her opening statements that Mr. Baldwin should be held criminally responsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins, the “Rust” cinematographer, because he had failed to take part in safety checks that day to see whether his gun contained a live round and because he used the weapon in a reckless fashion. \nThe case is being closely watched by Hollywood, and not just because of the star at the cen\n“He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins’s safety,” she said in the Santa Fe County District Courthouse. \nAlec Baldwin and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, on Wednesday. \n\nOne of Mr. Baldwin’s defense lawyers, Alex Spiro, argued that the actor could not be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter because it was unthinkable for live ammunition to be loaded into a gun that was being used as a prop on the set of a movie. He said Mr. Baldwin had been told that day that the gun was “cold,” which he said communicated to the whole production that “there’s nothing in the gun that can hurt anybody.” “Cold guns can’t hurt people,” Continued on Page A15 \n\n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — Afew weeks before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, a senior White House official visited eastern Lebanon for a sightseeing trip that doubled as a dramatic political statement. \nThe official, Amos Hochstein, one of President Biden’s most trusted national security advisers, toured the ancient ruins of Baalbek in an area well known as a stronghold of Hezbollah, a U.S.- designated terrorist group sponsored by Iran. \nWearing white pants and a golf shirt, and with no security entourage, Mr. Hochstein marveled at the artifacts and snapped photos of the onetime Roman city’s crumbling stone walls and columns.
