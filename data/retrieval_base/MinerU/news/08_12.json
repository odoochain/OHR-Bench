Page D1. \n# \n# \n# \nPARIS — After learning that she might lose the bronze medal she won in the floor exercise at the Paris Olympics — the only individual medal she won at these Summer Games — the American gymnast Jordan Chiles took to social media on Saturday and posted four broken heart emojis on a black background. \nThat’s four broken hearts for the four seconds that cost her a bronze medal. Four seconds over which she had no control. \nThe International Olympic Committee confirmed on Sunday that it would strip Chiles of her bronze medal and give it to Romania’s Ana Barbosu. The decision came after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on Saturday that Chiles’s coach had filed a scoring inquiry four seconds too late, according to gymnastics rules. \nThe United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said Sunday that it would appeal the reallocation of Chiles’s medal, and by Sunday afternoon, U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport’s governing body in America, had begun that fight. \nIn a statement posted on its social media accounts, U.S.A. Gymnastics said it had filed a letter and video evidence that it said showed “conclusively” that the U.S. coaching staff had requested an inquiry 47 seconds after Chiles’s final score was posted — well within the limit, it argued, that is imposed by the sport’s rules. \nChiles, who had helped the United States win the gold medal in the team event in Paris, and whose bronze in the floor completed the first all-Black podium in Olympic women’s gymnastics history, was subjected to racist abuse online after the judges’ initial decision to raise her score. That abuse and the stripping of her medal cast a shadow on the closing day of what had otherwise been a highly regarded Games. \nBarbosu was in third place in the floor exercise on Monday when Chiles, the final competitor, began her routine. Chiles was given a score of 13.666 points, which put her in fifth place. Barbosu began celebrating her bronze medal. At the same time, Chiles’s coach, Cécile Canqueteau-Landi, was filing an inquiry with the judges. Canqueteau-Landi said \nContinued on Page A5 \n# \n# \nPARIS — The athletes had lost. Their time in Paris was over. And they were, in this moment of defeat by a team from a political rival, not even allowed the comfort of their homeland’s name and flag. To be an Olympian from Taiwan is to not exist, at least not officially. To placate China, the island competes at the Games under the awkward designation of Chinese Taipei. The intrusion of politics into sports forces the island’s athletes to engage in the kind of rhetorical gymnastics that might trip up a champion tumbler, and which bring a particular sting when you \n# \nare a table tennis player who has just been beaten by Team China. “I’m only fighting for myself, through my own hard work,” said Taiwan’s Chen Szu-yu, substituting self for state on the Olympic stage. \nHer teammate Chien Tungchuan sidestepped the political discussion entirely, refraining from comment on Taiwan’s status at the Olympics. \nThere is no arena more international than the Olympics. The United Nations General Assembly, that other grand global endeavor, excludes the territories, the itty-bitty islands and the notquite nations that get to go to the Games. Puerto Rico, Palestine, Chinese Taipei — they all marched in the Olympic parade of nations, as did a refugee team whose 37 members were forcibly displaced from some of the very countries that competed alongside them in Paris. \n“I cannot answer that question,” he said. “May I go?” \nBut to accommodate such a d versity — North Korea and South Continued on Page A5 \nDIEGO IBARRA SANCHEZ FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \nHiking, Bonding and Military Drills As the war grinds on in Ukraine, summer camps have taken on a more patriotic tone.

In pledging their support, many offered emotional testimonies about the personal relationships they have built with her. \nBut it was not long before the men confronted the elephant in the room. \n“Sometimes as Black men we get confused as to what strength is, and sometimes we think that standing behind a Black woman as a leader does not display strength as Black men,” said Kwame Raoul, the attorney general of Illinois. “I’m here to tell you all tonight that it does the opposite of that — it displays strength.” \nMr. Raoul then drove home his point. “I’m standing behind a Black woman to be president of the United States, and it doesn’t make me any less of a Black man,” he said. “I’m asking all of you all to do the same.” \nThe call, one in a series the Harris campaign has held in recent weeks with Black women, white women and white “dudes,” was a rallying cry to a part of a crucial Democratic constituency seen as skeptical of Ms. Harris. \nWhile Black men have been reliable voters for Democrats for decades, Mr. Raoul was touching on an uncomfortable truth: A small but significant slice of Black men have historically been hesitant to support Black women seeking the highest positions of power. The numbers are on the margins but could be crucial to carrying Ms. Harris to victory in November. \nDr. Moya Bailey, a Northwestern University professor who coined the term “misogynoir” to describe racist misogyny, said in an interview that while patriarchy is not unique to the Black population, “the consequences are much higher.” Scholars note that a demographic group that is conservative on many social issues has historically equated leadership with masculinity, borne out in the dearth of Black female leaders in the church, business and elected office. \nWhen Shirley Chisholm, the Continued on Page A15 \nFrom a Young Teacher to a Frequent Visitor and Beijing Critic \n# \nA newly minted college graduate from small-town Nebraska, he had just turned down a stable, 9- to-5 job offer and moved across the world to teach at a local high school in China. He had made it as far as Hong Kong, just across the Chinese border, when People’s Liberation Army tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square to crush prodemocracy protests. \nRumors were flying about a possible civil war in China. Many foreigners, including most American teachers, had fled the country.
