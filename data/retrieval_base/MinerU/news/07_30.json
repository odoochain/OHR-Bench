Johnson Presidential Library and Museum in Austin, his first public engagement since he announced his decision to end his presidential campaign last week. \nHis visit was initially scheduled to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. But it quickly became a venue for Mr. Biden to begin buttoning up a 51-year legislative legacy while outlining an election-year intention to try to stop what many in his party feel is the Supreme Court’s ideological drift into conservatism. \nThe proposal would require congressional approval and has little hope of gaining traction in a Republican-controlled House and a divided Senate. In a social media post, Speaker Mike Johnson called the plan “dead on arrival” in the House. (Mr. Biden later said onstage that Mr. Johnson’s “thinking is dead on arrival.”) \n“They’re serious, man,” Mr. Biden said. “They’re planning another onslaught attacking civil rights in America.” \nThis month, the court issued a 6-to-3 ruling that grants broad immunity to presidents from prosecution for actions they take while in office. Mr. Biden called for a constitutional amendment that would limit such immunity. \n“For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost certainly means that the president can violate the oath, flout our laws and face no consequences,” Mr. Biden said. “Folks, just imagine what a president could do trampling civil rights and liberties, given such immunity.” \nMr. Biden, warning that “extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court’s decisions,” said conservative plans for sweeping policy changes if former President Donald J. Trump wins a second term, known as Project 2025, would continue to push the courts to the right. \nHis remarks were met with support from others in his party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who said she was a partner in the effort and would take up Mr. Biden’s proposal in her campaign. \n“These popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the court, strengthen our democracy and ensure no one is above the law,” she said in a statement sent by her campaign. \nThe conservative activist Leonard A. Leo, who is known for making the appointments of conservative judges a core of the Republican Party’s agenda, assailed Mr. Biden’s efforts as partisan: “It’s \nContinued on Page A14 \nVoters at a polling station at sunrise on Sunday for Venezuela’s presidential election, which drew accusations of widespread fraud. \n# \nThis article is by Haley Willis, Aric Toler, David A.

Trump took the stage in Butler, Pa., a local countersniper who was part of the broader security detail let his colleagues know his shift was ending. \n“Guys I am out. Be safe,” he texted to a group of colleagues at 4:19 p.m. on July 13. He exited the second floor of a warehouse that overlooked the campaign rally site, leaving two other countersnipers behind. \nOutside, the officer noticed a young man with long stringy hair sitting on a picnic table near the \n# \nwarehouse. So at 4:26 p.m., he texted his colleagues about the man, who was outside the fenced area of the Butler Fair Show grounds where Mr. Trump was to appear. He said that the person would have seen him come out with his rifle and “knows you guys are up there.” \nThe countersniper who sent the texts confirmed to The New York Times that the individual he saw was later identified as the gunman. \nBy 5:10 p.m., the young man was no longer on the picnic table. He was right below the countersnipers, who were upstairs in a warehouse owned by AGR International. One of the countersnipers took pictures of him, according to a law enforcement after-action report, which along with the texts from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit was provided to The Times by the office of Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. The text messages were independently verified by The Times. \nAt 5:38 p.m., the photos were shared in a group chat, and another text went out among the officers, saying they should inform the Secret Service. “Kid learning Continued on Page A13 \n\nJENN ACKERMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \nTo Paris the Hard Way Sunisa Lee overcame a lot to be able to defend her Olympic all-around gymnastics title.

Pro-government paramilitaries responded by opening fire in the air and police shot tear gas to disperse the protests. \nProtesters tried to reach the election headquarters in Cumaná, 250 miles east of the capital, but they were pushed back by the National Guard. \nThe disputed election put renewed attention on the Biden administration, whose negotiations Continued on Page A8 \n# \n# \nLebanese Tense as Israeli Counterattack on Militia Looms \n# \nJERUSALEM — Tensions were high on both sides of the IsraeliLebanese border on Monday as Israeli leaders vowed to deliver a significant military blow against the armed group Hezbollah in response to a deadly rocket attack over the weekend. \nThe attack on Saturday killed 12 children and teenagers in the Druse Arab village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. \nHezbollah, an Iran-backed militia that dominates southern Lebanon and that has been firing rockets into Israel for months, denied responsibility for the strike. But Israel and the United States blamed the group, saying it was Hezbollah’s rocket that had been fired from territory it controls. \nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited the site of the attack on Monday, said, “Our response is coming, and it will be severe.” Local residents heckled Mr. Netanyahu, telling him they had no security and chanting, “Murderer! Murderer!” videos posted on social media showed. \nMr. Netanyahu’s visit to Majdal \nAVISHAG SHAAR-YASHUV FOR THE N.Y.T.

The strike and Israel’s expected counterattack have raised fears that nearly 10 months of armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into an all-out war. \nIsrael and Hezbollah have since fired thousands of missiles across the border, wrecking towns, killing hundreds, displacing tens of thousands on both sides of the lines and leading each to threaten the other with a ground invasion.
