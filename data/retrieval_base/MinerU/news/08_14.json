Mr. Netanyahu has consistently placed all blame for the deadlocked negotiations on Hamas, even as senior members of the Israeli security establishment accused him of slowing the process himself. \nThis article is by Ronen Bergman, Patrick Kingsley and Adam Rasgon. \nDoubts have also been raised about Hamas’s willingness to compromise on key issues, and the group requested its own extensive revisions throughout the process, while ceding some smaller points in July. On Tuesday, Ahmad Abdul-Hadi, a Hamas official, said the group would not be participating in a new round of negotiations set to take place in Doha, Qatar, or Cairo on Thursday. \nAmong other conditions, the latest document, presented to mediators shortly before a summit in Rome on July 28, suggested that Israeli forces should remain in control of Gaza’s southern border, a detail that was not included in Israel’s proposal in May. It also showed less flexibility about allowing displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in northern \nBut the documents reviewed by The Times make clear that the behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the Netanyahu government has been extensive — and suggest that agreement may be elusive at the talks set to begin this week. \nBut in private, Mr. Netanyahu has, in fact, added new conditions to Israel’s demands, additions that his own negotiators fear have created extra obstacles to a deal. According to unpublished documents reviewed by The New York Times that detail Israel’s negotiating positions, Israel relayed a list of new stipulations in late July to American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that added less flexible conditions to a set of principles it had made in late May. \nA ship named the United States that Ms. Gibbs has come to adore. In fact, she has dedicated her life to saving it. \nMs. Gibbs’s grandfather William Francis Gibbs was a famous ship designer, and the United States was his masterwork. But remarkably, she knew almost nothing about that until she was well into adulthood. \n“This, I would not have predicted,” she said recently about being responsible for a rusty steamship. \nMs. Gibbs, 62, works in Washington at a private foundation where her primary focus is eradicating genital cutting of women. Between that and her advocacy for the ship, she noted, “People must be so confused by my social media presence.” \nPHILADELPHIA — Susan Gibbs needs to find a new parking spot, fast. And not just any parking spot will do. \nIt needs to be big enough for an ocean liner. \nIt’s for a ship bigger than the Titanic, one that is nearly as long as the Chrysler Building is tall. A ship so luxurious that it was the first choice of presidents and royalty. A ship so trusted that it once carried the Mona Lisa. A vessel so fast that its mammoth propellers, churning the sea beneath its grand promenades and shipboard orchestras, were a Cold War state secret. \n# \nContinued on Page A9 \n# \nKicking up dust, Ukrainian armored vehicles rumbled past, unimpeded, as the flow of men and weaponry carried on in the biggest foreign incursion into Russia since World War II, an offensive now nearing the end of its first week since the breach of the border here in Sudzha and at several other sites. \nSUDZHA, Russia — All that remained of a Russian border post was a tableau of destruction: Sheet metal flapped in the wind, customs declarations fluttered about, and stray dogs roamed under a road-spanning sign that said, “Russia.” \nAt the crossing point, a Ukrainian soldier posted on the roadside waved at the forces passing by, days after Russia’s head of the general staff declared that the attack had been rebuffed. \nA few days ago she drove from Washington to Philadelphia, where the United States is docked on the Delaware River. There, she would attend an important meeting of the small nonprofit group she heads, the S.S. United States Conservancy, which owns the ship. I joined her for the drive. \nUkrainians carried a dead Russian soldier away from the rubble of a border post at the Sudzha crossing point in Russia on Monday. \n# \nSusan Gibbs wants to rescue the storied S.S. United States, which was designed by her grandfathe \n# \nAlong the way she shared her infectious appreciation for the historic vessel, telling stories from the glory days, back in the 1950s and ’60s. She spoke of the sweeping symbolism of such a luxurious, technologically advanced ship carrying the nation’s name and laughed about how Salvador \nWithin the first month of the war, Ukraine did strike back with a cross-border helicopter assault and has regularly bombarded \nAt the border, the detritus of a losing battle — and signs of soldiers caught by surprise — were scattered about: bullet cartridges tinkled underfoot, discarded body armor lay on the asphalt. \nTaking the fight to Russian soil was a weighty moment for Ukraine in its war with Russia, coming two and a half years after Russia launched a full-scale invasion and 10 years after Russia intervened militarily to seize territory and support separatist client states in eastern Ukraine. \n# \nYet a shadow hung over our drive. A ship-size shadow. The ship is being evicted from its pier in Philadelphia.

Two smaller, earlier forays into Russia by Russian exile groups backed by the Ukrainian Army ended in quick retreats. \nDalí would travel on the United States accompanied by his pet ocelot. \nUkrainian troops sliced easily through a thinly defended border, pushing tens of miles into Russia and shifting the narrative of the war after a glum year in which Ukraine had struggled, often in vain, to hold back Russian advances across its eastern front. \nBut until last week, Ukraine forces had not counterattacked into Russia. \nBy Monday, Ukraine’s commanding general had told President Volodymyr Zelensky that his troops held 390 square miles of territory in Russia’s southeastern Kursk region. Two dozen settlements were overrun. \n“I’m happy to be riding a tank into Russia, and it is better than Continued on Page A8 \n# \nAbout 30 uncommitted delegates representing the Democratic primary voters who opposed President Biden — largely over what they see as his tilt toward Israel in the war launched after the Hamas attacks last October — will have unfettered access to make their voices heard. State party leaders, led by Lavora Barnes, the chairwoman of the Michigan Democratic Party, and Ken Martin, the chairman of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota, have for months worked to defuse tensions and head off a high-profile clash. \nMillions of Americans now receive their prescription medications through mail-order shipments, either for convenience or because their health plans require it. But the temperatures inside the cargo areas of delivery trucks can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, according to drivers — far exceeding the range of 68 to 77 degrees recommended by the national organization that sets standards for drug handling. \nThousands of demonstrators are expected in the streets and the parks of Chicago for next week’s Democratic National Convention, most of them to protest the U.S. role in the war in Gaza. But officials are concerned about the potential for a more embarrassing spectacle: prime-time disruptions inside the arena itself. \nMelted capsules. Cloudy insulin. Pills that may no longer work. Doctors and pharmacists say the scorching temperatures enveloping the country could be endangering people’s health in an unexpected way: by overheating their medications. \nThose diplomatic efforts, along with the elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris to replace Mr. Biden as the Democratic nominee, have yielded progress, people on both sides said. But as of now, the delegates are still planning to make their presence at the pro\n# \n# \nContinued on Page A13 \n# \nThe Arizona Secretary of State’s office said it had certified 577,971 signatures collected by a coalition of abortion rights groups, 50 percent more than required to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot in November. It is the largest number of certified signatures for any ballot measure in state history. \nMail-order pharmacies say that their packaging is weather resistant and that they take special precautions when medication “requires specific temperature control.” But in a study published last year, independent pharmaceutical researchers who embedded data-logging thermometers inside simulated shipments found that the packages had spent more than two-thirds of their transit time outside the appropriate temperature range, “regardless of the shipping method, carrier, or season.” \nTurnout Expected to Rise in a Key Swing State as Energy Grows \nThe run of abortion rights successes has put Republicans and anti-abortion groups on the defensive. They have mounted “decline to sign” campaigns, filed lawsuits trying to prevent signatures from being certified, and sponsored legislation trying to make it harder for ballot measures to pass. Before the high court overturned Roe, almost every abortion-related ballot measure had been sponsored by the anti-abortion side. \nA similar question will appear on the ballot in Missouri, after the Secretary of State there said on Tuesday that abortion rights groups had collected 254,871 valid signatures, more than enough to place the measure on the ballot. Missouri, the first state to enact an abortion ban after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, could become the first state where a citizen-sponsored measure overturns a near-total ban. \nArizona voters will decide in November whether to establish a right to abortion in the state constitution, a measure that could strongly influence turnout in a battleground state crucial to the presidential election and control of the Senate. \nExtreme temperatures can alter the components in many medications, from pancreatic enzymes to the thyroid replacement drug Continued on Page A17 \nMeasures to establish or protect abortion rights are already on the November ballot in six other states: Florida, South Dakota, Colorado, New York, Maryland and Nevada. But only Arizona and Nevada are seen as presidential battleground states, where Democrats are hoping that support for abortion rights will drive higher turnout in their favor. (South Dakota and Missouri are the only two of those states with near-total \nAbortion rights groups have prevailed in all seven states where the question of how to regulate abortion has been put directly to voters in the two years since the demise of Roe, the 1973 decision that said the United States Constitution protected a right to abortion. \nDEMOCRATS SEE EDGE \n# \nContinued on Page A15 \n# \n\n# \nFixing Climate: Here’s the Dirt An Australian start-up is hoping fungi can pull carbon dioxide from the air and stash it underground.
