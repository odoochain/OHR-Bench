Some lobbying firms have highlighted their connections to Ms. Harris, drawing the ire of allies seeking to avoid the perception that she is beholden to special interests. \n“Human nature is such that anybody that ever walked past somebody on the street would try to capitalize,” said former Senator Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat who is close to Ms. Harris. “Especially in a campaign for president, there is always going to be those folks.” \n“That’s Washington, isn’t it?” he added. \nMr. Jones — a government relations adviser, but not a registered lobbyist, at the law and lobbying firm ArentFox Schiff — said he was planning a Washington fundraising event for Ms. Harris’s campaign featuring lawyers from a host of firms. \nThe dramatic reset of the presidential race has intensified a Washington tradition, as lobbyists and other government affairs professionals rush to signal connections to the candidates. \nExecuted deftly, this can create demand among prospective cliContinued on Page 16 \nGLOBAL VIEW Diplomats say Kamala Harris has an iron hand in a velvet glove. PAGE 10 \n# \nWhen his book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” was published in 2016, JD Vance sent an email apologizing to a close friend from his Yale Law School days. The friend identified as transgender, but Mr. Vance referred to them in the book as a lesbian. \n“Hey Sofes, here’s an excerpt from my book,” Mr. Vance wrote to his friend, Sofia Nelson. “I send this to you not just to brag, but because I’m sure if you read it you’ll notice reference to ‘an extremely progressive lesbian.’” \n“I recognize now that this may not accurately reflect how you think of yourself, and for that I am \n# \nreally sorry,” he wrote. “I hope you’re not offended, but if you are, I’m sorry! Love you, JD.” \nNelson wrote back the same day, calling Mr. Vance “buddy” and thanking him for “being sweet,” adding, “If you had written gender queer radical pragmatist, nobody would know what you mean.” Nelson asked for an autographed copy, then signed off with, “Love, Sofia.” \nThat exchange is from a series of emails between two friends, part of a close-knit group of 16 students who remained together throughout their first law school semester in the fall of 2010. As now-Senator Vance seeks the vice presidency, Nelson has shared about 90 of their emails and text messages, primarily from 2014 through 2017, with The New York Times. \n\nThe emails, in which Mr. Vance criticizes former President Donald J. Trump both for “racism” and as a “morally reprehensible human being,” add to an already-existing body of evidence showing Mr. Vance’s ideological pivot from Never Trumper to Mr. Trump’s running mate. \nContinued on Page 14 \nCHANG W. LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES \nimone Biles, training in Paris for her third Games, has a record 37 Olympic and world medals. \n# \n# \nWith a toe-tapping Beyoncé song blasting in the arena, Simone Biles leaped up to the balance beam and wobbled, leaning over and circling her arms like windmills as if she were trying not to fall off a cliff. \nA few more times in her routine, she faltered on the four-inch-wide beam. And when she finished her routine at June’s U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials, it was clear what she thought of her effort. \nInstead of just frowning or shaking her head in frustration, which would have been the norm, because the judges were watching, Biles — who ended up winning the meet — let out an expletive. \nFans in the arena loudly gasped. \nFrom a top gymnast on the national stage, showing that kind of emotion is rare, and that particular word may have been unprecedented. But Biles no longer worries about being judged, on or off \nthe competition floor.   \nAt 27, she is the best gymnast in history, by natural talent and also medal count, having transformed the sport with dangerously difficult routines that remain unmatched. For years, she sacrificed both mind and body for gymnastics, competing under psychological torment as a sexual assault survivor and with physical pain that made her feel as if she would need a wheelchair by the time she turned 30. \nContinued on Page 8 \n# \nOn Its No-Fail Mission, the Agency Faces Fatigue, Scrutiny and Low Morale \n# \nOver the years, whenever the United States Secret Service’s lack of resources has been an issue, agents invoke a tongue-incheek motto: We do more with less. \nIt’s a sentiment that might no longer apply. \nInterviews with current and former Secret Service agents reveal an agency that wears down its employees, risking their sharpness. And they portray an organization that spends so much money on physical protection that there are few funds left to stay abreast of the latest law enforcement training and technologies. \nAn assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump at a campaign rally on July 13 in Butler, Pa., has exposed weaknesses in the Secret Service’s make-do approach to security for the country’s highest elected officials, their families and visiting foreign leaders. \nKimberly A. Cheatle, before she resigned as Secret Service director, told a congressional committee on Monday that the shooting — which left the former president’s ear bloodied and injured three other spectators, one fatally — “is the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades.” \nThe agency’s security lapses in Butler have spurred numerous investigations and prompted debate as to whether the Secret Service, which is operating with its largestever budget, has adequate resources to fulfill its critical mandate and is using its funds in the most effective manner. So far this year, according to an agency official, the Secret Service has secured more than 7,500 sites, including the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \n“The Secret Service is conducting a top-to-bottom review of all of our operational security policies and procedures to see where we may need to request additional resources to bolster our protective mission,” a spokesman for the Secret Service said in a statement to The New York Times. \n\nThe agency has come under scrutiny for having turned down some requests for additional federal security assets for Mr. Trump’s detail, though the agency says that was not the case on July 13. The agency says it routinely uses local law enforcement officers to supplement its protective forces. While the agency has said about 100 law enforcement officers were present in Butler, it has not said how many of them were active Secret Service employees. \nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump said on social media that he would continue to hold outdoor rallies. \nThe Secret Service currently looks after 36 protectees, down from 42 during Mr. Trump’s presidency. This year, the service, which employs more than 8,000 people, received \\$3.1 billion in congressional funding. \nBy comparison, the U.S. Marshals Service, whose 5,600 employees protect federal judges and courts and transport prisoners, \nContinued on Page 18 \n\nKimberly A.

If ever there was a perfect vehicle to carry Hollywood’s progressive climate change messaging — a big-budget movie about people caught in worsening storm patterns — wasn’t this it? \nApparently not. Movies should not be about “preaching a message,” Lee Isaac Chung, who directed “Twisters,” said in a prerelease interview that served as a dog whistle to conservative ticket buyers. \nTrend spotting in cinema is a hazardous pursuit. Sometimes a movie is just a movie. “Twisters,” however, is emblematic of a clear shift in Hollywood: After a period of openly using movies to display progressive values, sometimes \nContinued on Page 19 \nJENIN, West Bank — Less than three years ago, Wassif Frahat spent \\$3 million to open a lavish, two-story restaurant, the Ali Baba. With an impressive, pillared entryway, polished stone floors, glittering chandeliers and colorful frescoes on the high ceilings, the restaurant was his commitment to a better future. \nThe Ali Baba, in Jenin, is just a few minutes’ drive from the Jalameh checkpoint, which in normal times allows Israeli Arab citizens entry to the West Bank. The atmosphere is Palestinian, and the shops, restaurants and services are significantly cheaper than in Israel. The crossing also allows Palestinians with valid entry permits to go to jobs in Israel. \nBut after Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, the checkpoint was closed. Israel withheld most tax revenue from the authorities in the West Bank, in an effort to weaken them and clamp down more broadly on Palestinians. The economy in the territory’s north collapsed, and the better future that Mr. Frahat expected now seems farther away than ever. \nThe war that followed the invasion is devastating Gaza, but it is also impoverishing the West Bank, which has become a kind of second front in Israel’s battle against Palestinian militancy. \nThe Palestinian Authority, Continued on Page 6 \n# \nDecathlete Who Went to Fight About 500 top Ukrainian athletes and coaches have died in the war.
