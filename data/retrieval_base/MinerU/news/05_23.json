Over the loudspeakers at the local mosque, the Afghan police officers ordered everyone to gather: The commander was here. \nThe prisoners knelt with their hands bound as Raziq spoke to his men. A pair of his officers raised their rifles and opened fire, sending the prisoners into spasms on the reddening earth. In the silence that followed, Raziq addressed the crowd, three witnesses said. \n“You will learn to respect me and reject the Taliban,” \n# \nHow the United States Backed Kidnapping, Torture and Murder in Afghanistan \nWhen the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan, it left secrets in the desert.

Kennedy Jr. was considering potential running mates for his presidential run, his shortlist was initially topped by two wellknown men with unusual ré- sumés: Aaron Rodgers, the N.F.L. quarterback and frequent purveyor of conspiracy theories, and Jesse Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota and professional wrestler known as “The Body.” \nLast summer, two years after an upside-down American flag was flown outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., another provocative symbol was displayed at his vacation house in New Jersey, according to interviews and photographs. \n# \nMs. Shanahan, 38, a onetime Silicon Valley lawyer, has never held public office and has scant name recognition. But she was selected after Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Ventura fell through as vice-presidential candidates and Mr. Kennedy’s campaign needed money to fund its efforts to get onto state ballots, \nInstead, Mr. Kennedy made a surprise pick — a woman and a little-known figure with an unusual background: Nicole Shanahan. \nThis article is by Jodi Kantor, Aric Toler and Julie Tate. \n# \nHe ruled over the crucial battleground of Kandahar   \nduring a period when the United States had more   \ntroops on the ground than in any other chapter of the   \nwar, ultimately rising to lieutenant general thanks to   \nthe backing of the United States.

He also sought warrants for three top leaders of Hamas. \nPalestinian leaders in the West Bank welcomed the recognition by the three countries as an important symbolic gesture. Serious negotiations on a two-state solution have not been held for over a decade. And some observers argue that by not recognizing a Palestinian state, the West has enabled a far-right Israeli agenda opposed to its existence. \nKEY SYMBOLIC GESTURE \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has also frustrated world leaders — and two members of his war cabinet — with his refusal to establish a postwar plan to govern Gaza, where the health authorities say that more than 35,000 people have been killed. \nThree photographs obtained by The New York Times, along with accounts from a half-dozen neighbors and passers-by, show that the Appeal to Heaven flag was aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in July and September of 2023. \nMore than 140 countries have recognized Palestinian statehood. But most countries in Western Europe and the United States have not, arguing that statehood can come only through a negotiated agreement with Israel. \nSimon Harris, the Irish prime minister, linked his government’s decision to Ireland’s quest for independence from Britain. “From our own history, we know what it means: Recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value,” he said at a news briefing. \n“We believe it will help preserve the two-state solution and give Palestinians hope that they will have their own state side by side with Israel in peace and security,” Ziad Abu Amr, a senior Palestinian official in the West Bank, said in an interview. \nMr. Netanyahu, who has said that the establishment of a Palestinian state would pose an “existContinued on Page A5 \nCoordinated Rebuke for Israel From Norway, Spain and Ireland \nremake American government in Christian terms. \n# \nGoogle street view image Continued on Page A19 \n# \n# \n# \n# \nThe Texas city agreed to pay most of the families of schoolchildren who were shot in a 2022 massacre, and to overhaul its police force.
