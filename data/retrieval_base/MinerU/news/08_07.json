A breakup was reversed on appeal, but key legal findings were upheld. And Microsoft was prohibited from forcing restrictive contracts on its industry partners and ordered to open some of its technology to outsiders — preventing the company from single-handedly controlling the internet. \nMore than two decades later, a ruling in a Google antitrust case similarly promises to shape new rules for the tech industry. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search to protect its monopoly. \nGoogle’s loss could have major ripple effects for competition today. U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own products on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals. The Google ruling, and potential remedies to be decided by Judge Mehta, are likely to weigh heavily on those cases, including a second lawsuit against Google over ad technology, which is scheduled to go to trial next month. \nJudge Mehta’s ruling is “a predictor of what other courts might do,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt UniContinued on Page A11 \n\nVice President Kamala Harris with Gov.

Epstein, Katie Rogers, Erica L. Green and Shane Goldmacher. \nWASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, chose Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate on Tuesday, elevating a former football coach whose rural roots, liberal policies and buzzy takedowns of former President Donald J. Trump have recently put him on the map. \nBut he jumped to the top of Ms. Harris’s list in a matter of days, helped by cable news appearances in which he declared that Republicans were “weird.” The new, clear articulation of why voters should reject Mr. Trump caught on fast and turned the spotlight on the plain-spoken Midwesterner behind it. \nMr. Walz, 60, emerged from a field of candidates who had better name recognition and more politically advantageous home states. Minnesota is not a top-tier presidential battleground and is unlikely to prove critical to a HarrisWalz victory. \n“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep,” Ms. Harris said in a social media post confirming his selection. “It’s personal.” \nMr. Walz (pronounced Walls) appeared with Ms. Harris at a rally on Tuesday evening in Philadelphia, their first appearance as the Democratic ticket. In his own post on social media, Mr. Walz said it was the “honor of a lifetime” to be chosen as her running mate. \n“Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school,” he said. \nWith his straight-talking style, Mr. Walz was thought to be someone who could match up well in a debate against Senator JD Vance of Ohio, whom Mr. Trump chose last month as his running mate. And after two weeks of vetting and deliberations, Ms. Harris connected best with Mr. Walz in comparison with the other choices. \nMr. Walz leapfrogged betterknown contenders in part because Ms. Harris viewed him as an Everyman figure from Minnesota whose Midwestern-dad vibe balanced out her Bay Area background, according to three people familiar with the vice president’s thinking. \nOver and over in the selection process, loyalty had been emphasized as one of the most important criteria for Harris. This suggests that Mr. Walz convinced her he would support her not only in winning but also in helping her govern. \nIn her social media post, Ms. Harris highlighted Mr. Walz’s biography as a National Guardsman and his time as a high school teacher, football coach and adviser of the Gay-Straight Alliance. She also pointed to his efforts as governor to work with Republicans on bipartisan measures while pushing progressive priorities. \nMr. Walz is in his second term as governor and spent 12 years in Congress, where he was the rare Midwestern Democrat represent\nContinued on Page A14 \nFODDER FOR TRUMP The G.O.P. nominee attacked Kamala Harris over a market slide. PAGE A16 \n# \n# \nFor the past two weeks, his narrow restaurant, Yang Xiao Chu, has been transformed into a bustling, unofficial clubhouse for table tennis, a sport followed most fervently and practiced most successfully in China. His store — one of the closest Chinese restaurants to the arena, but far enough that you would need to have sought it out — has been practically bursting at the seams with current Olympians, former gold medalists, team staff members, journalists and countless hungry fans. “I didn’t expect we would get this busy during the Olympics,” Tang said one recent morning, before the lunch rush. “I just look after them as if they were my family members.” \nPARIS — As Tang Zhongqiu knows, there often comes a time in an Asian person’s trip to France when one grows weary of the endless parade of bread and seeks respite in a simple bowl of rice. \nThis is true of backpackers and businesspeople and, it turns out, Olympic table tennis champions. So while Tang assumed there would be an uptick in customers at his Chinese restaurant in the 15th arrondissement of Paris after a nearby convention hall was converted into the table tennis arena for the Summer Olympics, he had no idea it would be like this. \nTang, much to his disbelief, has Continued on Page A6 \n# \nBINT JBEIL, Lebanon — The town in south Lebanon appeared deserted, its roads empty and its market shuttered, after months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel across the nearby border made many residents flee. \nBut in a central square this summer, Hezbollah had erected huge banners for the triple funeral of a man the militant group claimed as its own and his two sisters, all killed when Israel bombed their home in this southern town of Bint Jbeil. As the coffins arrived, martial music blared and a few hundred of the remaining residents came \nAs Hezbollah and Israe Extend Their Fight, Anxiety Spreads \nto pay their respects. Watching the procession, Asmaa Alawiyeh, an accountant, said life was hard after months of clashes. Her two children were out of school. Her husband, a plumber, could not find work. And no one knew when life would return to normal. “There is no plan,” said Ms. Alawiyeh, 32. “We have no idea what to prepare for because we have no idea what’s coming.” Since the Gaza war began in \nOctober, Hezbollah has been fighting a second, smaller battle along the Lebanon-Israel border to bog down Israeli forces and help Hamas, its ally in Gaza. The violence there has killed hundreds of people and displaced more than 150,000 in both countries, leaving the border zone dotted with rubble-strewed ghost towns. \nNow, fear has spread that a broader war could erupt, after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah official in response to an attack from Lebanon that killed 12 children and teenagers in an Israeli-controlled town in which the group denied its involvement. Hours after the killing, a Hamas leader was assassinated in Iran; Continued on Page A7 \n\nIn Bint Jbeil, Lebanon, in July, mourning the deaths of a Hezbollah member and his two sisters. \n# \n# \nThat is why Mr. Robinson and the two sons who run the family farm with him, both with nagging backs, were delighted when a developer put down a nonrefundable retainer for 156 of their acres on the fast-growing fringe of the Twin Cities exurb of Lino Lakes, Minn. The builder’s ambitious plan called for a housing development for 434 homes. It would include shops, restaurants, tennis courts, soccer fields, a park with a pavilion — and a 40,000-square-foot mosque. \nLINO LAKES, Minn. — Butch Robinson is done. After dedicating most of his 77 years to growing sod, he just wants to sell his sprawl of green and ease his aching back into the lounge chair of a hard-earned retirement. \nIt culminated last month with a packed City Council hearing on a proposal to pause development in the precise corner of Lino Lakes that features the Robinson sod farm. Butch Robinson was present, his white hair tucked under a U.S.A. baseball cap. So was the developer. So was the resident leading the opposition. \nThe mayor and the four other council members, all white men, sat at a curved table with an American flag drooping behind \nSo began a conflagration over a small emerald swath of the American dream, fueled by colliding hopes and mutual distrust. At the dispute’s core: clashing interpretations of what inclusion looks like. \nJENN ACKERMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Rolling sod on the Robinsons’ farm in Lino Lakes, Minn. \nthem. Scowling like a principal anticipating school-assembly misbehavior, the mayor expressed hope for a “good positive session.” \nThen everyone stood to pledge allegiance to one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. \nHarold Robinson isn’t sure how he became “Butch,” but the nickname has stuck for decades, just as he’s been stuck in pretty much the only place he’s ever known. \nHis father and an uncle bought the land in the 1940s and turned the wiregrass fields into a farm for vegetables and, eventually, sod. For many years, Butch Robinson lived here with his parents and three siblings in a small home with an outhouse and an unobstructed view. “No neighbors at all,” he said. \nHe helped out with the crop, lost part of a thumb in the process, Continued on Page A12 \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \nA Nobel laureate was chosen to head an interim government, after the country’s longtime leader fled.
