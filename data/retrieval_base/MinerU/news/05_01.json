The war has already killed more than $34{,}000$ Palestinians, Gazan health officials say. \n“The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question,” he said in a meeting with the families of hostages being held in Gaza, according to a statement from his office. “We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there — with or without a deal — in order to achieve the total victory.” \nBut with Hamas arguing that any agreement should include an end to the war, and with rightwing politicians in Israel threatening to leave the government coalition if the long-planned incursion into the southern Gazan city of Rafah is delayed, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel reserved the right to keep fighting. \nAfter seven months of an IsraelHamas war in Gaza, the United States, Qatar and several other countries have been hoping to broker a cease-fire, and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is visiting the Middle East to press for an agreement. \nThe Cochamó Valley in central Chile features a cathedral of towering granite walls popular with rock climbers around the world. \nRoberto Hagemann, a Chilean businessman who owns the 325,000-acre property, has agreed \n# \nCease-Fire Won’t Stop It, Netanyahu Says \nAt a news briefing on Tuesd hn F.

He and his friends had gone to see the encampment, not intending to provoke, he said.

They are not sure precisely how the protest leader determined they were supportive of Israel. “Suddenly we are being called ‘the Zionists’ in their encampment,” Mr. Weinberg said. “He put a target on our back.” \nOn Thursday, the incident took on new significance when a video from January resurfaced on social media showing the same protest leader, Khymani James, saying “Zionists don’t deserve to live” and “Be grateful that I’m not just going out and murdering Zionists.” \nThe deal is also a case study in modern-day conservation. At a moment when ecologically sensitive lands are under threat around the globe, it takes a unique confluence of legal, financial and political resources — plus a bit of luck — to protect them from relentless development. \nThe next day, Columbia officials announced they had barred Mr. Continued on Page A11 \n“This is an irreplaceable place,” said Jeff Parrish, a senior execuContinued on Page A7 \nHaving traded up from sports coats in the Syracuse University law school library to suit coats in the Oval Office, however, Mr. Biden cannot simply shrug off the uproar on American college campuses as he once could.

Protests and ANALYSIS chanting and tiedye shirts were not his style. “I was in law school,” he later recalled. “I wore sport coats.” \nNow, 56 years ago to the day after the police stormed Hamilton Hall to evict demonstrators in one of the most iconic moments of the 1960s protest movement, Mr. Biden has no more affinity for their modern-day successors occupying the same university building to voice their outrage over Israel’s war in Gaza. \nHigh Fed rates, a response to stubborn inflation, mean that American assets offer better returns than much of the world, and investors need dollars to buy \nEvery major currency in the world has fallen against the U.S. dollar this year, an unusually broad shift with the potential for serious consequences across the global economy. \nTwo-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, whose recent strength stems from a shift in expectations about when and by how much the Federal Reserve may cut its benchmark interest rate, which sits around a 20- year high. \n# \n# \n# \n# \nBut in 2016, the lawyer, Keith Davidson, was on the verge of something grander than a run-ofthe-mill sex tape or affair. He had two clients shopping stories so big they might sway a presidential election: Their names were Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, and they were ready to tell the world about their sexual encounters with Donald J. Trump. On Tuesday, Mr. Davidson took the witness stand at Mr. Trump’s criminal trial in Manhattan, telling jurors the behind-thescenes story of how Mr. Trump’s allies bought his clients’ silence. His hours of testimony opened a rare window on the seamy world of celebrity hush money and corroborated key facts underpinning the prosecution’s case against Mr. Trump, the first American presi\nHe was the man behind the hush money, the amiable Beverly Hills lawyer who specialized in celebrity dirt — unearthing it, and then, for the right price, burying it forever. \nDEALS IN THE SHADOWS \nIn a crucial back-and-forth with prosecutors, Mr. Davidson began to tie Mr. Trump to the \\$130,000 hush-money payment to Ms. Daniels, the porn star whose payoff is at the heart of the case. Although Mr. Trump did not pay Ms. Daniels directly — his fixer, Michael D. Cohen did — Mr. Davidson portrayed Mr. Trump as the hidden hand shaping the machinations. \nThe yen is at a 34-year low against the U.S. dollar. The euro and Canadian dollar are sagging.
