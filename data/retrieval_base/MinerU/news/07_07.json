It was a blow to the conservative faction in Iran’s ruling establishment and a major victory for the relatively moderate reformist camp, which had been sidelined from politics for the past few years. \nAfter polls closed at midnight, turnout stood at roughly 50 percent, about 10 percentage points higher than in the first round, with about 30.5 million ballots cast, according to the interior ministry. \nThe first round had a record-low turnout as many Iranians boycotted. But the prospect of a hardline administration that would double down on strict social rules, including enforcing mandatory hijabs for women, and remain defiant in negotiations to lift international economic sanctions, apparently spurred Iranians to turn out. \n“The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, compassion and trust,” Mr. Pezeshkian wrote on social media after his win. In another post, he thanked the young people “who came to work lovingly and sincerely for Iran” and “shined a ray of hope and confidence in the future.” \nMr. Pezeshkian said during the campaign that he recognized fixing the economy was inextricably linked to foreign policy — namely the standoff with the West over the nuclear program — and would negotiate to lift sanctions. \nHe has said he opposes the mandatory hijab law. But when it Continued on Page 7 \nPresident Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris celebrated the Fourth of July at the White House with their families on Thursday. \n# \n# \n# \n# \nAll sounds fine in President   \nBiden’s world.

The Democrats \nwho want him to drop out? No one has told him that. \nFor Mr. Biden, the crisis seen by so many Democrats who are not on his payroll — and by some who are — is nothing more than another bump in the road, another obstacle to overcome as he always has. He does not agree that he is slipping as he ages. He does not accept that he is losing to former President Donald J. \nTrump. He does not believe much of his own party wants him to step aside. \nHis prime-time interview that aired on ABC News on Friday night was an exercise not just in damage control but in reality control. For much of his long and storied political career, Mr. Biden has succeeded through sheer force of will, defying the doubters and the skeptics and the scorners to prove that he could do what no one expected. Yet now, in what may be the most threatened moment of his presidency, that self-confidence leaves him increasingly isolated in his own party. \n“You really see a president in Continued on Page 19 \nSELMA, Ala. — By early this year, around the time a prosecutor called President Biden a “wellmeaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Vice President Kamala Harris already knew something had to change. \nIt was up to her, she had told allies, to finally distinguish herself in her job — something she had been struggling to do for more than two years — and reassure American voters that the BidenHarris ticket was still a safe bet. She had been feeling sidelined in the early stages of the campaign, one adviser said, and she wanted a bigger role. \nShe fled the Washington bubble and embarked on an ambitious travel schedule, making more \nHer allies emphasize that she has been taking on a bigger role for some time, notably after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

It was dusk. A team member looked for bandages. \nThat is when, Mr. Grosse said, a fellow soldier hobbled over and fired his weapon into the Russian soldier’s torso. He slumped, still breathing. Another soldier fired — “just shot him in the head,” Mr. Grosse recalled in an interview. \nMr. Grosse said he was so upset by the episode that he confronted his commander. He said he spoke to The New York Times after what he regarded as unwarranted killings continued. It is highly unusual for a soldier to speak publicly about battlefield conduct, particularly involving men whom he still considers friends. \nThe shooting of the unarmed, wounded Russian soldier is one of several killings that have unsettled the Chosen Company, one of the best-known units of international troops fighting on behalf of Ukraine. \nMr. Grosse’s witness recollection is the only available evidence of the trench killing. But his accounts of other episodes are bolstered by his contemporaneous notes, video footage and text messages exchanged by members of \nBut he said he was too troubled to keep silent. \nContinued on Page 6 \n# \n# \nCOEUR D’ALENE, Idaho — The Claremont Institute has been located in Southern California since its founding in the late 1970s.
