She would look up and say, “Listen, do you hear them?\" I would hold my breath. We were in the woods with the partisans. Though we didn't know the exact meaning of the word. We sat around our (invisible) campfire. We were hiding from the Nazis. They would take us away.

She said, maybe once-when her brother's barbecue project in the backyard hadn't turned out.There was no starvation,there were no Nazis in Texas. No hiding with partisans. Nothing but two daughters in the sixties with saltines and green olives stuffed with pimentos and sometimes a strand or two of raw spaghetti on the side. \nFor years I kept a getaway bag in my closet, saltines and a notebook, a change of clothes. An alarm clock, so I would know the time. I liked the big friendly white and gold face of that alarm clock.

        "text": "t some point we stopped playing Nazi. It wasn't my idea to start or stop. Maybe Rosi stopped playing with me, started playing with her own friends, and no more Nazis. We outgrew Nazis. When I was twenty-one I went to Amsterdam and alone I went to the Secret Annex. It was on the tourist map. Each room was small and there was a guest book to sign with a fancy gold pen, unattached to anything, no string or chain. There were the books Anne Frank had read while she was in hiding and movie-star pictures pinned to the wall. The place was small, it had no power, too many people walking through. \nTen years after that, a layover in the Amsterdam airport, a Greek man saw me borrow someone's tour book of the Anne Frank house. The Greek man said to his American wife:“Of course she's interested in Anne Frank—she's Jewish.\" The man who'd bought the book wasn't Jewish.I said nothing.The Greek could tell I was Jewish. \nThere is a statue of Anne Frank in front of a church in Amsterdam.In the walk-in closets in Houston now are full-length mirrors and the shelves each of us covered in our favorite pink contact paper, ruffles we tacked along the edges. The closets are shrines. In Rosi's closet are my mother's mink coat and the large bride doll too big to play with, and the felt board with felt numbers. \n\nWhere I live now, I don't sit in the closets. The closets are full. I'm on the third floor. No Nazis bang against my screens at night. Around the world people are defacing Jewish graves, threatening pogroms. In my neighborhood Jewish Community Center I watched a slide show of someone's trip to Europe—pictures of Auschwitz-Birkenau, rust-colored gas chamber.“It was cold,” the traveler told us, “so very very cold. Everyone told us to bring our sweaters, even though it was a warm day\" Ghosts breathing out cold air from having absorbed the force of someone else's hatred. About a hundred-seventy-five miles from the camp, the traveler had seen two young boys spray-paint on a memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto. She said, “There is hatred for Jews where there are not even Jews anymore.\" \nAnne Frank was shipped from Auschwitz-Birkenau to Bergen-Belsen. I read about her all through my childhood. She never seemed like a child to me. At parties I eat olives and saltines. Alone at night shadows brush against my face. At the JCC, one slide showed words in a foreign language carved into a wall at the concentration camp. The traveler thought it said never to forget. In my late twenties when I felt sad, I would go to the public library and read The Diary of Anne Frank. It was warm and familiar. It would comfort me. \n# \nDays of Honey,   \nDays of Onion   \nThe Story of a Palestinian   \nFamily in Israel   \nMICHAEL GORKIN   \n\"Steering clear of propaganda, Gorkin, an American psy  \nchologist living in Jerusalem, presents a refreshingly   \nbalanced portrait of a   \nPalestinian family in Israel...
