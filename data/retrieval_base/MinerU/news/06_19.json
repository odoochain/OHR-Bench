Boris Epshteyn, who was arraigned Tuesday on election interference charges in Arizona, has played many roles for former President Donald J. Trump. \nCalled Failure, Project Could End Early \nWhen the pier was conceived, health authorities were warning that the territory was on the precipice of famine. In recent weeks, Israel has given relief organizations greater access, but the groups say the situation remains dire. \nThe pier was never meant to be more than a stopgap measure while the Biden administration pushed Israel to allow more food and other supplies into Gaza through land routes, a far more efficient way to deliver relief. But even the modest goals for the pier are likely to fall short, some American military officials say. \nA college friend of Mr. Trump’s son Eric at Georgetown University, he would become a swaggering TV surrogate for the 2016 Trump campaign before eventually serving as Mr. Trump’s unofficial chief fixer and legal strategist. When Mr. Trump was convicted in New York last month on 34 felony counts, Mr. Epshteyn (pronounced EP-stine) was at his side, huddling with the former president and other aides after the verdict. \nThe Biden administration initially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable. But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month, a looming deadline that officials say they hope will pressure Israel to open more ground routes. \nPresident Biden ordered the U.S. military to begin building the pier in March, at a time when he was being sharply criticized for not doing more to rein in Israel’s military response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks. \nMAXAR TECHNOLOGIES, VIA REUTERS The pier last week before being moved because of high seas. \nIn the month since it was attached to the shoreline, the pier has been in service only about 10 days.

With five months until the presidential election, Mr. Biden has been trying to curtail record numbers of illegal border crossings without alienating longtime supporters who have called for a more humane immigration system after the Trump years. \nPolicy Intends to Balance Recent Crackdown on Asylum Seekers \n“These couples have been raising families, sending their kids to church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, where he was joined by members of Congress and DACA recipients, known as Dreamers. “They’re living in the United States all this time with fear and uncertainty. We can fix that.” \n“Honestly, if we didn’t make the gyemoim, then it would have been too difficult for us to arrange that kind of trip,” Ms. Kim said. “It would have cost too much, and we didn’t want other members to feel pressured by that.” \nhelp friends or families split travel costs equally so everyone can participate, regardless of his or her personal budget. \nThe policy aims to help people who have been living in the United States for more than a decade, building lives and families here. Even though marrying an American citizen generally provides a pathway to U.S. citizenship, people who crossed the southern border illegally — rather than arriving in the country with a visa — are required to return to their home countries to complete the process for a green card. \nThe new program allows them to remain in the country while they pursue legal status. \nWASHINGTON — President Biden on Tuesday granted farreaching new protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have been living in the United States illegally for years but are married to American citizens. \n“We’re a much better and stronger nation because of Dreamers,” Mr. Biden said, as he marked the anniversary of the Obama-era DACA program. \nUnder the new policy, some $500{,}000$ undocumented spouses will be shielded from deportation and given a pathway to citizenship and the ability to work legally in the United States. It is one of the most expansive actions to protect immigrants since Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was enacted 12 years ago to protect those who came to the United States as children. \nMr. Biden also said he would make it easier for young immigrants, including Dreamers, to gain access to work visas, a significant move that could help them eventually get a green card. That would protect their legal status even if DACA, which is already tied up in litigation, disappears. \nThere are roughly 1.1 million undocumented immigrants married to citizens in the United States, according to FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group, but not all of them are eligible for the program.
