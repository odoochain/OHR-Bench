It is the day on which Indians both at home and abroad enthusiastically hail  the decision of the Congress whereby it changed its goal from one of selfgovernment for India within the British Empire to one of Purna Swaraj or  Complete Independence and total severance from the British. On this day, Indians also take what is known as the Purna Swarajya Pledgewhereby they solemnly resolve to carry out the struggle for freedom till Purna Swaraj is attained. \nIt was at its Lahore Session in 2589 （1929) that the Congress passed the historic resolution declaring that the word “Swaraj” in Article I of the Congress Constitution defining the Goal of the Congress, shall mean Complete Independence,and called upon the entire nation to devote its exclusive attention  to the attainment of Complete Independence for India. Soon after, the Working Commit tee of the Congress met on 2nd January.2590 (1930) and decided to observe a day all over India as the Purna Swaraj Day and the 26th January,2590 (1930) was fixed for the purpose. The day was observed with unprecedented enthusiasm all over the country, and was continued to be observed year after year.The 26th day of January became alandmark inour struggle for Complete Independence. \nThe Pledge is amasterly analysis of the rightof the Indian people to Purna Swaraj and the urgent need for ending British Imperialism in India. \"The British Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually”, says the Pledge and, after explaining the above statements in detail, adds: “We hold it to be a crime against man and God to submit any \nThe Working Committee also issueda Declaration to be read and be adopted by the people all over the country on the Purna Swaraj Day.This De claration was in the form of a Resolution orPledgewhich later came to be known as the Historic Independence Day Pledge.According to the Working Committee's  instructions this Sacred Pledge is to be read in public meetings in towns and villages all over the country, and adoptedby  the people without distinction of caste, creed,colour, age or sex. Where owing to jllness or other physical disability the people are unable to be present at a meeting, they are required to take the Pledge in their homes individually or in groups The Pledge was thus solemnly taken by every man,woman and child in India on January 26, 1930, and it was renewed year after vear on the historic Day. \nVol.2.No.23.\n# \nSir Ardeshir Dalal, the socalledMember for postwar planning and development in the Viceroy's Executive Council, has  revealed some ofthe diabolic plans of his British masters to control all Indian industries in the future. SpeakIng in Madras on Tuesday, Sir A,Dalal warned that all private enterprises would have to submit to government control after the war. He said that the ammunition industries and the production of power and essential commodities, such as fertilisers,would always be owned and controlled by the Government. \nControl -Over Indigenous Industries Revealed In Post-War Schemes \nEven in the case of other Industries, he said,Government control would be imposed on private enterprises. Sir A. Dalal said that he couid not give details of the extent to which Indian industries are going to be stifled by the British Government after the war. \nCommenting on these plans ofthe British Governmentto control Indian industries, com Detent Indian observers say that if the British Raj is going to exerclse such control,it will be very much to the advantage of the British capitalists and very much to the disa.dvantage of the Indian businessmen India's national independence is vitally necessary for the right kind of India's industrialisation, these observers added. \nIn pursuance of its alterable mission,the Congress served the final ultimatum on the British in the form of the famous Quit India Resolution,on August 8,2602 (1942) and called upon the entire nation to rise up and launch the final Revolution against,the British.Meanwhile,Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose rallied the three million Indians in East Asia and launched the final armed battle against the British. Caught in between the Revolution within the country and the armed attack from without,BritishImperialistic power in India today has been considerably weakened,and the day is not far off when it will completelyvanish from our Sacred Soil.Today,therefore, we are certainly nearer our longcherished goal than we ever had been. Let us keep this fact uppermost in our minds as we celebrate the Purna Swaraj Day today and solemnly renew the Sacred Pledge. \nlonger to a rule that has caused this four-fold disaster to our country.We,therefore,hereby solemnly resolve to carry out the Congress instructionscsued from time to time for the purposeof establishing Purna Swaraj.\" \nFRIDAY,JANUARY 26,2605, SY0WA 20 \nTokyo,January 22 (Domei） The funeral services for the late Rash Behari Bose,former Supreme Adviser to the Provisional Government of Free India, who diedyesterday morning,will be held at Zojoji Temple here on the morning of January29. \n# \nRangoon,Jan.25 （Domei)- Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as Head of State of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind and concurrently President of the Indian Independence League in East Asia,today issued instructions to IIL.branches throughout East Asia to hold condolence meetings onJanuary 29 and pass resolutions in appreciation of the late Rash Behari Bose's lifelong services to the cause of India's independence. \nNetaji also announced that on January 29 the funeral ceremony of the late Rash Beharl Bose,Supreme Adviser to the Provisional Government of Azad Hind, win be held in Tokyo. \nTokyo, January 24 (Domei) On the eve of the third anniversary of Thailand's declaration ofwar on Britain and the United States,Premier General Kuniaki Koiso dispatched the following telegram toPremier Kuang Aphaiwong of Thailand: \"It is three years ago that your country,sharing the ideal of my country to liberate East Asiatic peoples from the yoke of the Anglo-Americans and to establishthe GreaterEast \nIn Syonan the Indian public will observe Monday the 29th instant as a day of mourning in memory of the late revered leader.

In conducting a large scale war it is necessary, theKosei-ka Cho stated, mobilization of manpowerfor essential services should be carriedoutvery rigidly.

Those who give false information to the Auxiliary Police will be punished according to the regulations \n# \n(By A Domei Military Comm). Tokyo,Jan.25 （Domei)-The difmiculties arising from extended supply lines are now before UnitedStatesforces which recklessly embarked on the invasion of Luzon Island. The United States in its operations in the European theatre of war, found 50.000 tons of bottoms utilized over a two or three week period was sufficient to transport one division of trcops. But, the Phinppme front is not the European front, and the United States to its dismay finds that to transport the same single division of soldiers to thePhilippine Isiands,not only is 200.000 tons of shipping needed, but it would take morethan  two months'time. Thrus itmeans that the ratio of shipping the United States must employ in the Pacific war theatre is seven to three when compared with the European war theatre. The extended supply line to the Phippines may be truly said to be unprecedented im war history. \nSurprising is the fact that the enemy,after enormous sacrifices sacrifices vast enough to endanger anti-Axis war planswas only able to place five or six divisions on the Luzon front. To feed these divisions on Luzon Island, its operational strength, the enemy must continuously increase his supplies. \nEnemy operations on Luzon Island meanwhile,have failed to achieve any perceptible progress and on he contrary enemy forces are falling victim to the effective tactics of our assault units. Out of growing impa tience,the enemy, by further reinforcing his strength,is attempting to speed up the opening ofa decisive battle.But our forces are coolly and firmly taking a waiting-stand which jis adding to tne enemy's irritation. \nThe New Year Gift to India Fund which closes on Jan.31 is being enthusiastically supported by the various sections of the Indian community in Syonan,it is understood \nThe Local Affairs Committee which collected recently a tidy sum of \\$200,000 towards Netaji Fund again busy making housr, house collections for this d \nis evidence of keen and heatny rivalry among the various L.A.C.
