For more than a year, as his poll numbers sank, his aides and loyalists insisted that his legislative record and priorities were viewed favorably by Americans and would ultimately carry him to another term. \nCHICAGO — When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, she had more than 200 distinct policy proposals. Four years ago, Joseph R.

Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had already received a call from the same number, so she knew who wanted to talk to her. \nVice President Kamala Harris was calling to tell her she was running for president and hoping to build support as quickly as possible. Mrs. Clinton didn’t hesitate: \n\n# \nAs Democrats revolted against Mr. Biden’s re-election bid this summer, Mrs. Clinton wanted no role in pushing him out, according to people briefed on her thinking. But behind the scenes, she was also adamant that if the president chose to step aside, Ms. Harris should become the party’s nominee with no drawn out primary. \nThe two women, once on opposite sides during the contentious 2008 Democratic primary, have quietly bonded over the past sev\nShe told the vice president she was all in.

Much has happened since then — from Mrs. Clinton’s grief over and eventual acceptance of her 2016 loss, to the rise of a new generation of Democratic leaders.

Years earlier, as a professional ballerina, she had struggled with disordered eating, and she wanted her son to think of food as fun. \n“I made the homemade purées, and I got the expensive little baby blender, and I tried to concoct these things from scratch, and then, from Day 1, he didn’t like it,” Ms. Best said, wincing at the eight-year-old memory. “He was crying and arching his back, and turning his head, and particularly did not like me coming at him, at his face, with a spoon.” \nMs. Best’s son stopped eating altogether by his first birthday, and his weight dropped so precipitously that a doctor recommended a feeding tube. It took a team of therapists and dietitians to get \nBut no matter what she did, the baby seemed to hate eating. \nLAUREN PISANO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES In baby-led weaning, children feed themselves solid food. \nhim back on track. Ms. Best concluded that his issues stemmed from finding her spoon-feeding “invasive,” and when she became pregnant with twins, she resolved to find a different way to teach them how to eat. \nShe came across baby-led weaning, a concept pioneered in 2001 by Gill Rapley, a former midwife and public health nurse from Britain. In contrast to the conventional medical advice that parents spoon-feed babies special infant cereals and purées, parents instead offer their babies solid food that they feed to themselves, usually at around 6 months old. \n\nTo the uninitiated, baby-led weaning can seem shocking and scary: You’re really just going to hand an infant with no teeth a whole chicken drumstick? But proponents insist it is not only safe when done properly but also promotes oral- and motor-skill development and a healthier, happier attitude toward food. \nMs. Best, now 47, began posting her first attempts with her twins on Instagram in 2019. They started off feeding themselves more traditional early foods, such as oatmeal and yogurt, but soon Ms. Best, an adventurous eater, grew bolder, offering them sardines, pieces of star fruit, even \nContinued on Page A18 \n# \n# \nZelensky’s Risky Wager on Talks With Moscow \nThis article is by Anton Troianovski, Andrew E. Kramer, Kim Barker and Adam Rasgon. \nBERLIN — In July, as he secretly readied an invasion of Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine sent a very different signal in public: He wanted talks to end the war. \nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr. Zelensky said he had a plan to end the “hot stage” of the war this year. He dispatched his foreign minister on a surprise trip to China, a mission to improve Ukraine’s relationship with Russia’s most important partner. And he pushed for a series of international meetings, including one planned for Qatar this month, in which he hoped to rally backing for Ukraine’s positions and pave the way for a broader settlement. \nHis summer overtures departed from the two years of Mr. Zelensky’s refusing to offer any hint of concessions in the face of a Russian invasion that many Ukrainians believe aims to wipe their country off the map. And they made it all the more stunning when on Aug. 6, Ukrainian forces rolled into Russia’s Kursk region, delivering one of the most embarrassing moments for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in 30 months of war and confounding predictions that the two countries might be headed toward a cease-fire. \nKyiv is making a risky bet: that the incursion gives it new leverage for a favorable deal with the Kremlin, even as its military remains on the defense across much of the front line in Ukraine. Russians who know Mr. Putin expect him to lash out in response, believing that his military has the upper hand in personnel and weaponry. \nThere are already signs that cease-fire efforts suffered a setback. A diplomat involved in the talks said that Russian officials postponed a meeting planned to be held in Qatar this month to negotiate a deal in which both sides would stop attacks on the other’s energy infrastructure. The postponement was reported earlier by The Washington Post. \nIn comments reported on Monday by Russian state media, Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said, “At the current stage, given this escapade, we are not going to talk.” The length of any pause in negotiations, Mr. Ushakov added, “depends on the situation, including on the battlefield.” \nGrigory A. Yavlinsky, a longtime Russian politician who met with Mr. Putin last October to promote the idea of a cease-fire, said in an interview from Moscow that there had been hope in the Russian capital that “the fighting would stop this year.” \n“The circumstances that have just happened,” he added, “they have lowered all these chances, they have removed them from \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \nPhil Donahue, who in the 1960s reinvented the television talk show with a democratic flourish, inviting audiences to question his guests on topics as resolutely highminded as human rights and international relations, and as unblushingly lowbrow as male strippers and safe-sex orgies, died on Sunday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 88. \nHis death was confirmed by Susan Arons, a representative of the family. \n“The Phil Donahue Show” made its debut in 1967 on WLWD\nTV in Dayton, Ohio, propelling him on a 29-year syndicated run, much of it as the unchallenged king of daytime talk television. \nAlmost from the start, the show   \ndispensed with familiar trap  \npings.

Wasps attacked as they tried to clear forest. Heavy rains turned the road to their camp to mud. \nRunning low on supplies, some wanted to turn back. Instead, they worked harder and eventually carved out an enclave. \n\n“There’s a place here where I wanted to live so we came and opened part of it up,” recalled Wilhelm Thiessen, a Mennonite farmer. “That’s what everyone did to have a place to live.” \nToday, seven years later, the cluster of homesteads is now a thriving colony, Wanderland, home to roughly 150 families, a church — which doubles as a school — and a cheese-processing facility. \n# \nIt is one of a string of Mennonite settlements that have taken root throughout the Amazon, turning forest into thriving farms but also raising concerns among environmentalists about deforestation of a jungle already under threat from industries like cattle ranching and illegal gold mining. Mennonite communities have come under official scrutiny, as well, including in Peru, where the authorities are investigating several, accusing them of clearing forest without required permits.
