The event, recalled today by only a handful of historians, occurred on October 26,1903. \n# \nThe plans and promises of the Key System were just as advanced and enthusiastic as those promoted todayby BART.But it only took eight years to build the Key System.BART may need 11. \nThe companywas backed byFrancis Marion“Borax” Smith,who came to Oakland before the turn of the century aftermaking a fortune in the borax business. \nSmith quickly began gaining control of local trolley lines and planned to build a gigantic empire of transit,property and utilitycompanies.His Realty Syndicate combine was one of the largestlandowners in Alameda County. \nElectric railways were \n\n# \nOrnate wood coaches halted at Adeline and 54th Streets on way to ferry \nbeing built all over the country and Smith and his associates weremindfulof theexperienceofreal estateinterests in other cities. It was a common and successful practice to buyproperty and then build trolley lines to it,raising the valueoftheland and making rich men out of the promoters. \nThe Smith interests believed that the Eastbay would prosper, and therefore so would their ventures,if there was fast train service to San Francisco.The SouthernPacific ran ancient steam-powered trains to ferry piers in Oakland and Alameda. \nThe San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose Railway was formed to compete with the SP.The company was to operate fast ferries between San Francisco and the Eastbay. Passengers would transfer to speedy electric trains taking them to Eastbay cities,and to SanJose. \nThe San Jose line was never built. But Smith succeeded in developingamodernferry systemandanetworkofelectric interurban lines in the Eastbay. \nHis first venture wasto Berkeley,where commuters had long been unhappy over SPservice.Residentsand and the ultra-modern ferries lured many customers from the SP.The Key System had trouble findingroom for all of the passengers.Soon,Smith extended servicetoother areas,and the SP was forced toelectrify its lines,which evolved into the‘Red Train” system. \n\nmerchants along Shattuck Avenue were less than enthusiastic about the smoky steam locomotives. \nService on 40th Street toa stationat41stStreetand PiedmontAvenuebeganin 1904.A line to Grand Avenue and Broadway opened in 1906, followed by service to the Claremont Hotel in 1908,and north Berkeley and Albany in 1911. \nThe ferry pier was built at the end ofalong trestle stretching almost toYerba Buena Island.Rails were laid along Adeline Streetand ShattuckAvenueto University Avenue in downtown Berkeley.The route between University and Shattuck avenues to Alcatraz Avenue and Adeline Street is the exact path being used todaybyBART. \nService to Berkeley began on October 26,1903. The modern electriccars ntheir flashy orange paint scheme tensions were made in ley and East Oakland andeastOakland World War II. \n\nTrains did not operate into downtown Oakland on a permanent basis until 1917.City officialsobjected to operation oflong trains on 12th Street.
