Bromwich and Maggie Haberman. \nLittle more than two weeks into Donald J. Trump’s presidency, he and his personal lawyer met in the Oval Office for a private conversation about money. \nMr. Trump has denied the alle  \ngations and the sex, and his legal   \nteam soon sought to sweep Mr. Co  \nhen’s revelations aside in cross  \nexamination. The lead defense   \nlawyer, Todd Blanche, attacked   \nMr. Cohen’s credibility, portraying   \nhim as out of control and bent on Continued on Page A19 \n“I was sitting with President Trump and he asked me if I was OK,” the lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, recalled on Tuesday from the witness stand at Mr. Trump’s criminal trial. “He asked me if I needed money,” Mr. Cohen said, and volunteered that a check would be forthcoming. \nWhen monthly checks started arriving — most bearing Mr. Trump’s signature — they disguised the nature of the payments, Mr. Cohen testified. The stubs described the checks as part of a legal “retainer” agreement, but they were in fact reimbursements for hush money that Mr. Cohen had paid to silence a porn star’s story of sex with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Trump was present when a plan to fictionalize the records was cooked up weeks earlier in New York. \nThe testimony marked a pivotal moment for prosecutors. They charged Mr. Trump with falsifying the checks and other records, and Mr. Cohen’s recounting drove those accusations home. It offered the jury its first and only personal account tying the former president to the documents at the crux of his case. \n# \n# \nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is polling stronger than any third-party candidate has in decades, pulling in roughly 10 percent of registered voters across the battleground states as he saps support from both President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, a new series of polls has found. \nThe overall results in the Biden versus Trump contest were virtually unchanged when Mr. Kennedy was included in the polls conducted by The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer. But beneath the surface of that seeming stability, the surveys revealed \n# \nhow Mr. Kennedy, powered by social media and younger voters, has emerged as an unpredictable X factor in what would otherwise be a 2020 rematch. \nWith less than six months until the election, the faction of the electorate giving Mr. Kennedy early support exposes some of the vulnerabilities inside the president’s Democratic coalition. Mr. Biden dropped all the way to 33 percent in a five-candidate race, an alarmingly low share of the vote for an incumbent president. The series of polls focused on what are expected to be the most contested states this fall: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \n\nTwo of the groups that Mr. Kennedy performed strongest with in the surveys — voters under 30 (18 percent support) and Latinos (14 percent) — have traditionally been strong Democratic constituencies, unnerving some party strategists.

The state was seeking a death sentence for Ernest Dykes, who had been charged with killing a 9-year-old boy during a robbery in Oakland. Weighing who should be struck from the jury pool and who should be kept, a prosecutor made notes about a prospective juror: “I liked him better than any other Jew but no way.” Other notes about prospective jurors bore evidence of similar prejudice: \n\n“Banker. Jew?” read one. “Jew? Yes,” read another. The notes — just handwritten scribbles — were discovered recently in an internal case file from the 1990s when Mr. Dykes was \n# \nconvicted of murder and sent to death row. A federal judge who is overseeing settlement talks as part of an appeal by Mr. Dykes told the Alameda County District Attorney’s office to conduct a topto-bottom search for any additional documents, and that effort turned up the notes, which are now in the hands of the judge. \n\nThe notes offered a startling glimpse into a practice that some defense lawyers long suspected was going on, and that a former prosecutor had alleged was common in Alameda County — prosecutors seeking to exclude people Continued on Page A15 \n# \n# \nScramble to Replenish Ukraine’s Arsenal \n# \nThis article is by David E. Sanger, Julian E. Barnes and Kim Barker. \nWASHINGTON — Just 18 months ago, White House and Pentagon officials debated whether Russia’s forces in Ukraine might collapse and be pushed out of the country entirely. Now, after months of Russian ground advances and technological leaps in countering Americanprovided arms, the Biden administration is increasingly concerned that President Vladimir V. Putin has enough momentum to change the trajectory of the war, and perhaps reverse his oncebleak prospects. \nIn recent days, Moscow’s troops have opened a new push near the country’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, forcing Ukraine to divert its already thinned-out troops to defend an area that it took back from Russian forces in a stunning victory in the fall of 2022. \nArtillery and drones provided by the United States and NATO have been taken out by Russian electronic warfare techniques, which came to the battlefield late but have proved surprisingly effective. And a monthslong debate in Washington about whether to send Ukraine a \\$61 billion package of arms and ammunition created an opening that Russia has clearly exploited, even though Congress ultimately passed the legislation. \nIn interviews, American officials express confidence that many of these Russian gains are reversible once the spigot of new arms is fully opened and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine finds ways to bring more — and younger — troops to the front lines. But they are hesitant to offer predictions of where the battle lines may stand even a few months from now, or whether Mr. Zelensky will be able to mount his long-delayed counteroffensive. \nAmerican and allied officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity, in order to discuss intelligence reports and sensitive battlefield assessments. But some of the concerns have spilled out in public comments. \nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken said with some understatement on Sunday that “there’s Continued on Page A7 \nOfficials Say Void Allows Hamas to Reclaim Ground It Lost \n# \nJERUSALEM — With Israeli troops returning to clear Hamas for the second or third time from parts of northern Gaza, and fighting farther south in Rafah, too, Israel’s government has found itself confronting more vocal discontent from an important constituency: its own military leaders. \nThe two officials said Mr. Netanyahu’s unwillingness to have a serious conversation about the latter phases of the Gaza campaign — the “day after” the fight — has made it easier for Hamas to reconstitute itself in places such as Jabaliya in northern Gaza. \nCurrent and former senior military officers have begun to argue more openly that because the government has failed to roll out a plan for what follows the fighting in Gaza, Israeli troops are being forced — in the eighth month of the war — to battle again for areas of the territory where Hamas fighters have reappeared. \nTwo Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional repercussions, said some generals and members of the war cabinet were especially frustrated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to develop and announce a process for building an alternative to Hamas to govern Gaza. \nThere was little expectation, among officials or experts, that a new government would be formed while combat raged. But “clear, hold and build” is the widely accepted practice for fighting an insurgency. And to a growing number of critics, Israel appears to be simply stuck in clearing mode, increasing the risks for Israeli soldiers and Gazan civilians while cease-fire talks remain stalemated. \nIsrael first attacked Hamas’s ranks there in October — and returned this week with another air and ground assault. \nMuch of the global criticism of Israel over the war has focused on Continued on Page A10 \n# \n# \n# \nAlice Munro, the revered Canadian author who started writing short stories because she did not think she had the time or the talent to master novels, then stubbornly dedicated her long career to churning out psychologically dense stories that dazzled the literary world and earned her the Nobel Prize in Literature, died on Monday night in Port Hope, Ontario, east of Toronto. She was 92. A spokesman for her publisher, Penguin Random House Canada, confirmed the death, at a nursing home. Ms. Munro’s health had declined since at least 2009, when she said she’d had heart bypass surgery and had been treated for cancer, though she continued to write. \nMs. Munro was a member of the rare breed of writer, like Katherine Anne Porter and Raymond Carver, who made their reputations in the notoriously difficult literary arena of the short story, and did so with great success. Her tales — many of them focused on women at different stages of their lives coping with complex desires — were so eagerly received and gratefully read that she attracted a new generation of readers. \nIAN LLMS FOR THE NEW Alice Munro in 2013. \n\nMs. Munro’s stories were widely considered to be without equal, a mixture of ordinary people and extraordinary themes.
