LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone won a second straight gold in the 400-meter hurdles, doing so at the Paris Games in a world-recordsetting 50.37 seconds. Her compatriot, Noah Lyles, took bronze in the 200 meters, later revealing he has Covid. Sports Page B6. \n# \nThis article is by Rory Smith, Talya Minsberg and Jenny Vrentas. \nPARIS — Duco Telgenkamp came to the Paris Olympics with his strategy clear in his mind. The keys, he knew, were to be decisive and clear and, above all, to go early. “You have to get your move in first,” he said. “You have to give people a sign it will be a fist bump.” \nThe assertiveness is necessary. Like all athletes and staff members in the Netherlands’ Olympic delegation, Telgenkamp, a member of his country’s field hockey team, was told before arriving in Paris that handshakes, high-fives and hugs were forbidden. Official team policy held that the fist bump was the only permissible physical greeting. \nAfter qualifying for those Games, athletes had to navigate a bureaucratic Covid maze. They needed multiple negative tests from specific clinics, an endless stack of paperwork, a healthtracking app on their phones and a flurry of QR codes to present to officials upon arrival. \nWhen athletes tested positive, they were immediately placed in Continued on Page A8 \nFor fans, that has meant packed stands and a carnival-like atmosphere. For athletes, it has meant a completely different experience from the ones in Japan and China, where bubbles were imposed to allow the events to take place. \nThe Dutch approach is, of course, a legacy of the one word that nobody involved with the Paris Games likes to mention: coronavirus. Pandemic-era restrictions hollowed out the last two editions of the Games, in Tokyo in 2021 and Beijing a year later. Paris styled itself as the moment the Olympic flame could at last be — safely — reignited. \nIn Tokyo, athletes, visiting officials and members of the news media were tested for Covid every four days. In Beijing, everyone was tested daily. The only time athletes were unmasked was during competition, and even then their time without face coverings was minimal. Athletes gasping for breath at the National Stadium in Tokyo were handed masks and hand sanitizer seconds after finishing grueling races. \n# \n# \nBALTIMORE — For years, Baltimore’s leaders gave overdoses little public attention, even as the death rate swelled to unprecedented levels. But for a few weeks this summer, it seemed that the city would respond to its drug epidemic with new urgency. \nThe City Council was about to hold four hearings — planned after The New York Times and The Baltimore Banner reported that the overdose rate here was far higher than in any other major American city. And Mayor Brandon Scott had just announced a \n# \nBut hours before the first hearing, as demonstrators prepared to rally outside City Hall, the council president abruptly canceled the \\$45 million legal settlement with a drug manufacturer, raising the possibility of well-funded new public health efforts to combat the epidemic, which had claimed nearly 6,000 lives here in the past six years. \n\nsession, at the request of Mr.   \nScott’s administration. \nThe administration said that holding any of the public meetings would jeopardize a lawsuit the city had filed accusing numerous opioid makers and distributors of causing the crisis by flooding Baltimore with pills. City leaders believe the case could result in a transformative amount of money for its overdose response — far more than the \\$45 million it collected in a settlement with a single company that shipped relatively few drugs to Baltimore. \nThe decision to cancel the hearings was in keeping with the city’s Continued on Page A12 \n\nAfter a terror plot canceled Taylor Swift’s Vienna shows, her fans gathered for a cathartic singalong. \n# \n# \nVIENNA — Just as she was boarding her flight at Boston Logan International Airport headed for a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, Mary DePetris excitedly checked the online fan group, Swiftie Nation. \nAustrian authorities had discovered a terrorist plot targeting Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in the city, she read. On Wednesday, just \n# \nbefore takeoff, organizers canceled all three shows. Ms. DePetris, 47, stepped onto the plane and broke the news to some of her fellow passengers. \n“Half the plane was crying,” Ms. DePetris said. “It’s not just about the shows, it’s the community coming together and feeling safe at her concerts, and Swifties letting their guard down. And this just shifted all of that,” she said. “How can we do that now that we feel we are targeted?” \n\nContinued on Page A6 \nPLOT Two suspects aimed to kill as many people as possible, Austrian authorities said.

He supported a successful effort to raise the minimum wage and opposed Republican-advanced legislation that could subject doctors who perform abortions to criminal penalties. \nPresident Barack Obama’s signature legislation was supposed to save families thousands of dollars in health care premiums but still proved costly for some, the voter said. “What happened?” the man demanded. \nInstead, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who shared the stage with Mr. Walz, recalled in an interview that he stood by his decision. “He didn’t try to hide from the vote,” she said. “He leaned into it.” \nSome Democrats in politically vulnerable swing seats like Mr. Walz’s who had supported the bill tried to backpedal from their vote, a choice that voters punished them for at the ballot box later that year. \nMr. Walz acknowledged there was still work to be done on health care but defended the law to the crowd. “Don’t pretend that there was some type of safe harbor before this where everything was just peachy keen,” he said. \nNot Mr. Walz. \nHe was endorsed by the Na  \ntional Rifle Association, took its   \ncampaign donations and once re  \nceived an “A” rating from the   \ngroup — a score that would   \nabruptly fall once he ran for gov  \nernor and began to champion   \ntighter firearm restrictions, in  \ncluding an assault weapons ban. He won his House seat repeat  \nedly despite being a perennial ReContinued on Page A14 \nAt the same time, his voting record reflected the conservative tilt of his district. He voted in favor of a measure calling for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 90 days, but after it failed, he approved legislation providing fresh funds for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nEconomic Agenda Vastly Different From Term in White House \n# \nWASHINGTON — At his convention speech last month, former President Donald J. Trump declared that his new economic agenda would be built around a plan to eliminate taxes on tips, claiming that the idea would uplift the middle class and provide relief to hospitality workers around the country. \n“Everybody loves it,” Mr. Trump said to cheers. “Waitresses and caddies and drivers.” While the cost and feasibility of the idea has been questioned by economists and tax analysts, labor experts have noted another irony: As president, Mr. Trump tried to take tips away from workers and give the money to their employers. \nDOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES Donald J. Trump’s agenda has some notable reversals. \n\nThe reversal is one of many that Mr. Trump has made in his bid to return to the presidency and underscores his malleability in election-year policymaking. From TikTok to cryptocurrencies, the former president has been reinventing his platform on the fly as he aims to attract different swaths of voters. At times, Mr. Trump appears to be staking out new positions to differentiate himself from Vice President Kamala Harris or, perhaps, just to please crowds. \nTo close observers of the machinations of Mr. Trump’s first term, Continued on Page A15 \n# \n# \n“All they did was radicalize me, so now they need to be afraid,” Ms. Bush said in a fiery speech after her loss on Tuesday evening. “AIPAC, I’m coming to tear your kingdom down!” she shouted. \nWASHINGTON — After Representative Cori Bush, Democrat of Missouri, became the second member of the left-wing “squad” to lose her re-election bid, she placed the blame for her defeat solely on one organization: the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \nThe pro-Israel organization made no secret of its plans to target Ms. Bush, who had opposed providing Israel with funding for the war in Gaza. Through a political action committee, the group pumped more than \\$8 million into the race. \nOn Tuesday, its investment paid off: Wesley Bell, the St. Louis County prosecutor who aligned himself with Israel, defeated Ms. Bush in the Democratic primary as voters in the district rallied behind him. \n“Last night, Wesley Bell, a proIsrael progressive, achieved a consequential victory over an incumbent anti-Israel detractor,” said Marshall Wittmann, a spokesman for AIPAC. “Once again, a progressive pro-Israel Democrat has prevailed over a candidate who represents the extremist fringe that is hostile to the Jewish state.” \nIt was the second time in recent months that AIPAC has played a critical role in a Democratic primary race.
