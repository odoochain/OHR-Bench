SHEAR \nWASHINGTON — Nothing President Biden did seemed to work. \nHe delivered an angry, defensive rant on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He showed foreign policy chops at a news conference. He wrote a long letter to “fellow Democrats” demanding an end to the calls for him to step aside. He confronted lawmakers on a Zoom call that devolved into a tense, heated exchange about his age and mental competency. \nTwelve days ago, the president and his closest family members and advisers went on the offensive, determined to end what already had been nearly two weeks of hand-wringing over his listless performance at a debate on June 27. The result was a flurry of interviews, rallies, defiant meetings with his closest allies and impromptu campaign stops — all intended to rebut the premise that he was too old and frail to win a second term. \nBut almost every step was undercut by his own fumbles and the steady drumbeat of calls from his friends and allies for him to step aside, even from loyalists like the actor George Clooney. Together, it was evidence that nothing he was doing was having much impact. Mr. Biden was racing from place to place, but nothing was changing. \nThis story of the 12 days that Mr. Biden has spent trying to rescue his hopes for a second four years in the Oval Office is based on interviews with people close to him, including lawmakers, current and \nContinued on Page A16 \nEZRA ACAYAN/GETTY IMAGES ,Airline passengers in Manila took to massage chairs to pass the time while waiting on Friday. \n\n# \nError Shows Frailty of Tech Infrastructure \nThis article is by Adam Satariano, Paul Mozur, Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel. \nAirlines grounded flights. Operators of 911 lines could not respond to emergencies. Hospitals canceled surgeries. Retailers closed for the day. And the actions all traced back to a batch of bad computer code. \nA flawed software update sent out by a little-known cybersecurity company caused chaos and disruption around the world on Friday. The company, CrowdStrike, based in Austin, Texas, makes software used by multinational corporations, government agencies and scores of other organizations to protect against hackers and online intruders. \nBut when CrowdStrike sent its update on Thursday to its customers that run Microsoft Windows software, computers began to crash. \nThe fallout, which was immediate and inescapable, highlighted the brittleness of global technology infrastructure. The world has become reliant on Microsoft and a handful of cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike. So when a single flawed piece of software is released over the internet, it can almost instantly damage countless companies and organizations that depend on the technology as part of everyday business. \n“This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world’s core internet infrastructure,” said Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of Britain’s National Cyber Security Center and a professor at the Blavatnik \nSchool of Government at Oxford University. \nSatya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief   \nexecutive, blamed CrowdStrike   \nfor the disruption and said the Continued on Page A11 \nA cyberattack did not cause the widespread outage, but the effects on Friday showed how devastating the damage can be when a main artery of the global technology system is disrupted. It raised broader questions about CrowdStrike’s testing processes and what repercussions such software firms should face when flaws in their code cause major disruptions. \n“This is historic,” said Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer at WithSecure, a cybersecurity company. “We haven’t had an incident like this.” \nWhile outages are common, often caused by technical errors or cyberattacks, the scale of what unfolded on Friday was unparalleled. \nGeorge Kurtz, CrowdStrike’s chief executive, said that the company took responsibility for the mistake and that a software fix had been released. He warned that it could be some time before tech systems returned to normal. “We’re deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this,” he said in an interview on Friday on NBC’s “Today” show. \n\n# \n# \nA court in Russia on Friday sentenced Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, to 16 years in a high-security penal colony, ending his espionage trial on what were widely viewed outside Russia as fabricated charges. The verdict opens the way for a potential prisoner swap between the United States and Russia. \nThe harsh sentence represented the first espionage conviction of a Western reporter in modern Russia. But the expedited nature of the case suggested that Moscow might be ready to trade Mr. Gershkovich. The proceedings were recently moved up by more than three weeks, and the court concluded the case, a process that usually takes months, in a matter of weeks, with only three hearings. \nThe court said in a statement that Mr. Gershkovich did not admit guilt, but said “the totality of the evidence presented to the court was sufficient to render a guilty verdict.” Judge Andrei N. Mineev, who presided over the case, sentenced Mr. Gershkovich to two years less than prosecutors were asking. \nAt no time during the case, however, did prosecutors publicly provide any evidence to back up the charge, and the trial was held behind closed doors. The Russian judicial system for years has served as a tool of President Vladimir V. Putin’s domestic repression, handing down convictions and long sentences in cases with clear political motivations. \nIn Russia, once a person is charged with a crime, it is virtually impossible to get an acquittal in Continued on Page A8 \n# \n# \nMILWAUKEE — A little over two months ago, Elon Musk found himself at Montsorrel, the palatial Palm Beach compound of Nelson Peltz, the famed activist investor. Mr. Musk knew the sprawling grounds well, having stayed in the guesthouse. \nThe conversation was a bit different than usual, though: Mr. Peltz had gathered a group of billionaire conservative financiers — including Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and the hedge-funder John Paulson — to discuss whether Republicans could seize Senate control, as well \n# \nas the party’s weak ground game, according to a person with direct knowledge of what transpired. \nBut Mr. Musk had a darker message that spring day. He told the group that this would be the last free election in America — because if President Biden won, millions of undocumented immigrants would be legalized and democracy would be finished, according to the person. \nMr. Trump had to win, Mr. Musk said. He dispensed some advice for the veteran financiers, who had decades more experience in Republican politics than he did: Their emphasis on political advertising was misplaced, he said. Tesla, his electric car company, barely advertises, he said, but had still built a cult following through word of mouth. Why couldn’t Republicans do the same? \nThe most important thing that the financiers could do, Mr. Musk said, was ask two people to support Mr. Trump, and urge them to ask two more. Two people by two people — that’s how the former president would win. \nContinued on Page A14 \n\n# \nFirst responders at the funeral of a father of two killed in the attack on Donald J. Trump.

The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people. \nThe Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the country’s defense systems had apparently picked up the presence of the drone but had failed to register it as a threat. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets. \nREHOVOT, Israel — In a rare breach of Israel’s multilayered air-defense system, a drone fired by the Houthi militia in Yemen slammed into an apartment building near the United States Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv early Friday, killing at least one person and wounding eight others. \n“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday. \nAnother Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace. \nIsraeli officials did not a Continued on Page A5 \n# \nCHESTER HIGGINS JR./THE NEW YORK TIMES Mr. Dobbs on the set at CNN. \n# \n# \nLou Dobbs, the conservative television and radio host who loomed large over the cable news landscape for decades at CNN and Fox Business, and who later used his platform to promote baseless conspiracy theories and to lend unwavering support to former President Donald J. Trump, has died. He was 78. \nHis death was confirmed on Thursday on Mr. Dobbs’s website and social media accounts after Mr. Trump announced it on the Truth Social platform. No cause of death was given, and where or when he died was not immediately clear.
