Trump at a political rally in Pennsylvania said on Sunday that the gunman had used an AR-15 style rifle purchased by his father, and had left behind explosives materials in the vehicle he drove to the event. \nBut many details of the life and motives of the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, were still unclear. Federal authorities said the gunman had no history of mental health issues or previous threats, and had not been on the radar of federal law enforcement. \nAttorney General Merrick Garland said that the shooting was “an attack on our democracy” and that federal authorities would use every available resource to investigate the gunman. \nInvestigators were scouring his online presence and working to gain access to his phone, but so far had not found indications of strongly held political beliefs or any evidence that shed light on a motive. Mr. Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service agents moments after he began firing from a rooftop outside the rally where Mr. Trump was speaking. \nKevin P. Rojek, the F.B.I. official in Pittsburgh who is leading the investigation, said Mr. Crooks is believed to have acted alone and that there were no additional public safety concerns. \nContinued on Page A16 \nU.S. Is Likely To Be Ripped Further Apart \n# \nNEWS cratic speaker of ANALYSIS the House, Thomas P.

The teary-eyed Demoto the hospital room of the Republican president, held his hands, kissed his head and got on his knees to pray for him. But the assassination attempt against former President Donald J. Trump seems more likely to tear America further apart than to bring it together. Within minutes of the shooting, the air was filled with anger, bitterness, suspicion and recrimination. Fingers were pointed, conspiracy theories advanced and a country already bristling with animosity fractured even more. \n\nThe fact that the shooting in Butler, Pa., on Saturday night was two days before Republicans were set to gather in Milwaukee for their nominating convention invariably put the event in a partisan context. While Democrats bemoaned political violence, which they have long faulted Mr. Trump for encouraging, Republicans instantly blamed President Biden and his allies for the attack, which they argued stemmed from incendiary language labeling the former president a proto-fascist who would destroy democracy. \nMr. Trump’s eldest son, his campaign strategist and a running mate finalist all attacked the Continued on Page A17 \n\nAn annotated photograph by Doug Mills of The Times, who reflected on his experience at Donald J.

An “avid supporter” of Donald J. Trump, as Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania put it, Mr. Comperatore attended the former president’s campaign rally in Butler, Pa., on Saturday with his family, alongside thousands of fellow fans who gathered on a sweltering evening. \nThis article is by Ernesto Londoño, Isabelle Taft, Christina Morales and Brian Conway. \nWhen a gunman fired shots from the roof of a nearby building, Mr. Comperatore threw himself over his family members to shield them, according to the governor. Mr. Comperatore was shot in the head and died at the scene, authorities said. Two other rally attendees were critically injured in the shooting. \n\nOfficials and Mr. Comperatore’s sister, Dawn Comperatore Schafer, confirmed his identity on Sunday. “We watched him die on the news,” she said in a phone interview, through tears. “That’s how we found out.” \nMr. Shapiro, a Democrat, said on Sunday that Mr. Comperatore “died a hero,” adding that “Corey was the very best of us.” \nMr. Comperatore, of Sarver, Pa., had two daughters — Allyson, 27, and Kaylee, 24.

Shear, Glenn Thrush, Peter Baker and Michael Levenson. \nInvestigators searched on Sunday for a motive that would explain why a 20-year-old armed with an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle shot at former President Donald J. Trump, just days before he was to accept the Republican nomination for president. \nThe assassination attempt, which wounded Mr. Trump and killed one of his supporters, was being treated by the F.B.I. as a possible act of domestic terrorism. And it immediately raised questions about why the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies had not secured a nearby building outside the large outdoor venue where Mr. Trump held his rally. \nWithin moments, someone shouted “shooter down” and Secret Service agents, agitated but in control, began moving Mr. Trump offstage to safety. “Wait, wait, wait, wait,” he called out. He then made a point of pumping his fist at the crowd and seemed to defiantly shout, “Fight! Fight!” The moment — captured in photos that showed Mr. Trump’s fist held aloft, his cheek bloody, with the American flag behind him — roused Mr. Trump’s stunned supporters, who broke out in chants of “U.S.A.!” \nThe gunman apparently climbed onto the building’s rooftop with a rifle and fired multiple times, wounding Mr. Trump just minutes into his speech on a sweltering Saturday afternoon in Butler, Pa., north of Pittsburgh. \nMr. Trump was taken to the hospital on Saturday night but was able to walk off his plane unaided when it landed in New Jersey hours later. On Sunday, he vowed to remain “defiant in the face of wickedness” and flew to Milwaukee for the start of the Republican National Convention on Monday, saying he would not let the assassination attempt change his “scheduling, or anything else.” \nThe gunman, who was identified by the F.B.I. as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb, was killed by the Secret Service, the agency said. Law enforcement officials later found a possible rudimentary explosive device in his car, Paul Abbate, deputy director of the F.B.I., said. \nAn AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle found next to Mr. Crooks’s body had been bought by Mr. Crooks’s father, the F.B.I. said. It was not clear if he had given Mr. Crooks the weapon, or if Mr. Crooks had taken it without permission. \nThe gunman did not have a criminal history in Pennsylvania’s public court records.

WASHINGTON — President Biden on Sunday called for an “independent review” of security measures before and after the attempted assassination of former President Donald J. Trump, while directing the Secret Service to review all of its security measures for the Republican National Convention this week. \nMr. Biden’s directive, though brief and without specifics, is likely to increase the scrutiny of the decisions and possible failures of the agency charged first and foremost with protecting the lives of the country’s current and former leaders, and their families. \nLess than 24 hours after Mr. Trump was injured at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., members of Congress were promising hearings and former law enforcement officials were questioning why the warehouse roof where the wouldbe assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., fired shots was not covered by the Secret Service’s security perimeter, despite being within the range of some guns. \n\nMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, was herded off the stage and pronounced fine, but the gunman came shockingly close to succeeding. A spectator was killed in the shooting and two others were critically wounded. \n“Congress will do a full investigation of the tragedy yesterday to determine where there were lapses in security and anything else that the American people need to know and deserve to know,” Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said Sunday on NBC. \nThe chair of the House oversight committee also asked the Secret Service director, Kimberly A.
