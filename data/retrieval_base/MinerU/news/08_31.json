One of those plans would require Americans worth at least \\$100 million to pay taxes on investment gains even if they have not sold the stocks, bonds or other assets that have appreciated. \nUnder the plan, those Americans would owe a 25 percent tax on a combination of their regular income, like wages, and so-called unrealized gains. The so-called billionaire minimum income tax could create hefty tax bills for wealthy individuals who derive much of their wealth from the stocks and other assets they own. \nThe proposal has hit a nerve with some of the donors who have flocked to supporting Ms. Harris after Mr. Biden dropped out of the presidential race, according to seven people familiar with the conversations. \nSome have directed their complaints to the campaign’s advisers and top allies in the business community who are perceived to be in her inner circle. At least one top donor close to Ms. Harris has raised the issue with her in a private conversation, encouraging her to instead tax the ability of the ultrawealthy to borrow against their wealth. \nAllies and staff of Ms. Harris have defended the plan to business leaders in private conversations, explaining that the tax would apply to only a small slice of wealthy Americans and could be delayed for investments that are not easily sold, according to the people familiar with the conversations. \nStill, some donors close to Ms. Harris do not believe she is that committed to the idea. “In my interactions with them, the key is she focuses on her values and is not an ideologue about any particular program,” Mark Cuban, a billionaire and the former principal owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, said in an interview. “From what I’ve been told, everything is on the table, nothing’s been decided yet.” \nA campaign adviser said Ms. Harris supported the billionaires minimum tax but was open to alternative ways for substantially raising taxes on ultrawealthy Americans. Charles Kretchmer Lutvak, a spokesman for the Har\nContinued on Page A13 \n\nA Battle for Wisconsin Voters Tim Walz’s regular-guy image, attractive to Democrats, is facing critics who find Donald J.

Trump, would she be best off distancing herself from the 81-year-old president she had served for nearly four years and focus instead on establishing her own political identity? Or should she continue to embrace Mr. Biden and the more popular of his policies? \nAnd on the most practical level: Where should Mr. Biden go to campaign for her? How often? And what should he say? \nWASHINGTON — As she abruptly went from No. 2 on the Democratic ticket to No. 1, Vice President Kamala Harris had a decision to make: How should she deploy President Biden on the campaign trail? \nHer answers are now starting to emerge. Ms. Harris and the people running her campaign plan to use the president — but carefully, and in a targeted way. The president and vice president will campaign together some, but not too much. And Mr. Biden will travel mostly to the important swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where he still ap\nContinued on Page A12 \n# \n# \nSAN CLEMENTE, Calif. — The trip had been a long shot. Bob Garrison reminded himself of that as he stood on a pier a thousand miles from home. Behind him lay the tile-roofed beach town of San Clemente, Calif., his last stop. Before him stretched the Pacific Ocean, immense and unbound. \nGulls cried. Surf broke. It was Monday, his last day. Mr. Garrison could afford only so much time off. And yet what if he was close? \nHe had spent the last two days following up on leads, scouring parks, passing out fliers. “MISSING,” they said, in block letters \n# \nover photos of a 45-year-old man from Seattle, 6 feet, 6 inches tall with a beard to his chest, an ice-ax tattoo and a silver cross necklace. Homeless, the fliers could have said, too, one of more than 180,000 homeless people in California. So many that if they all were to come inside, they would fill San Clemente several times over. But on this June day, Mr. Garrison, an engineer from rural Ellensburg, Wash., was not thinking about California’s humanitarian crisis. He was just a 70-year-old man on a pier gazing out at an ocean, trying — too late, he feared — to rescue his son. \n\n“It wasn’t always like this,” Mr. Garrison said of his third child and namesake. Born in Southern California and raised in Seattle, his son, Robert Garrison, graduated from high school, had a career, supported a family. \nFather and son once had been close.

Israeli officials agreed this week to temporary and localized pauses in fighting to allow United Nations aid workers to deliver vaccines to 640,000 children. \nThose risks were underlined on Thursday when Israeli forces targeted part of an aid convoy in Gaza, killing four people, according to Anera, an American nonprofit that organized the trucks. The convoy was ferrying food and fuel to an Emirati-run hospital in southern Gaza and had coordinated in advance with the Israeli authorities, the nonprofit said in a statement. \nThe agreement for the vaccination campaign and the pause in fighting came together six weeks after the World Health Organization first said that traces of poliovirus had been found in wastewater in Gaza. Two weeks ago, a nearly 1-year-old boy was confirmed to be Gaza’s first polio case in 25 years, lending urgency to the need for widespread vaccinations for the disease, which can cause paralysis and death. \nThe Israeli military said “armed individua $\\mathrm{l}\\mathbf{S}^{\\mathfrak{N}}$ had joined a vehicle in the convoy and that it had carried out a strike targeting them. \nIn a conflict where the warring sides have agreed on precious little, Hamas says it will also abide by the staggered pauses in fighting, which are scheduled to begin on Sunday. \nBut health officials warn that the plan comes with enormous challenges. Much of Gaza’s infrastructure is in ruins, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are living in temporary shelters, and aid workers have been attacked while trying to deliver supplies. \nAn outbreak would add to the dire humanitarian challenges facing 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza — and would probably spur further international condemnation of Israel for the heavy wartime restrictions it has placed on the territory. The resurgence of the disease, which has been eradi\nContinued on Page A5 \n# \n# \n# \nLeonard Riggio, the brash, charismatic and literary-minded businessman who, in founding the giant Barnes & Noble retail chain, transformed the business of selling books as thoroughly as the rise of the paperback once did — and who was cast as both a hero and a villain for doing so — died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 83. \nHis death, from Alzheimer’s disease, was announced by his family. \nMr. Riggio, a son of a cabdriver, was just 30 in 1971 when he bought a fusty half-century-old bookstore in Lower Manhattan called \nLARRY BUSACCA/GETTY IMAGES Leonard Riggio in 2013. \n\nBarnes & Noble and began turning it into a literary behemoth. Within decades, it was the largest bookseller in the United States, with hundreds of superstores, many of them in places that had formerly been book deserts, like malls. \n\nThe outlets more resembled department stores than your typical bookstore: Each one offered thousands of titles, along with cappuccino and snacks, stationery and desk tchotchkes, a bountiful array of magazines and newspapers, and a congenial policy of allowing browsers to linger for hours. (It helped that there were public bathrooms.) And each store was a welcoming, if monolithic, agora that also served as an oasis for parents and caregivers, who could spread out in the expansive aisles of the children’s \nContinued on Page A20 \n# \n# \nRIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil blocked the social network X on Friday after its owner, Elon Musk, refused to comply with a Brazilian judge’s orders to suspend certain accounts, the biggest test yet of the billionaire’s efforts to transform the site into a digital town square where just about anything goes. \nAlexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, ordered Brazil’s telecom agency to block access to X across the nation of 200 million because the company lacked a necessary legal representative in Brazil. \nMr. Musk closed X’s office in Brazil last week after Justice Mo\n# \nraes threatened arrests for ignoring his orders to remove X accounts that he said broke Brazilian laws. \nX said that it viewed Justice Moraes’ sealed orders as illegal and that it planned to publish them. “Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes,” Mr. Musk said on Friday. \nIn an uncommon move, Justice Moraes froze the finances of a second Musk business in Brazil, SpaceX's Starlink satellite-internet service, to try to collect \\$3 million in fines he has levied against X. Starlink — which has recently exploded in popularity in Brazil, with more than 250,000 customers — said that it planned to fight the order and would make its service free in Brazil if necessary. \n\nJustice Moraes had also said that any person in Brazil who tried to still use X via common privacy software called a virtual private network, or VPN, could be fined nearly \\$9,000 a day. But after swift backlash across Brazil, including from academics who have supported him, he reversed that move in an amended order late Friday. \nContinued on Page A9 \n\n# \nThe Downtown Sound Harrison Patrick Smith, a.k.a. the Dare, is releasing his first album, “What’s Wrong With New York?” PAGE C1 \n# \nThe actor and comedian Brian Jordan Alvarez takes on polarizing subjects in his sitcom, “English Teacher.” PAGE C1 \n# \nZelensky Fires Air Force Chief The Ukrainian president gave no reason, but there are indications that friendly fire may have caused an F-16’s crash, a Western official said.
