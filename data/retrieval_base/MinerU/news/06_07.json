He has lobbied to open Olympic competition to men. \nFirst, the sport is much harder, and possibly even more insane, than you thought.

To many in both parties, Mr. Reagan’s speech remains the gold standard of presidential \nof his presidency. Forty years later, another aging president facing re-election plans to return to the same spot Friday to honor the same heroes and effectively align himself with Mr. Reagan’s legacy of leadership against tyranny. \nHis name is Bill May, and he is the only man on the team. A rule change in 2022 cleared the way for men to compete in the sport at this summer’s Paris Games. That means that this is May’s first and, realistically, last chance ever to \n# \nswimming, one of the athletes in the pool is very much not like the others. \n# \nIf there is something audacious about Mr. Biden, a staunch Democrat who was no friend of Mr. Reagan’s in the 1980s, summoning the spirit of the Republican legend, it speaks to the up-isdown, black-is-white nature of politics in today’s America.

On Saturday, the team will announce who made the final cut. \noratory and none have matched it at Normandy since. But like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Biden wants to use the inspiring story of the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc to make a case for American alliances in the face of Russian aggression — and, implicitly, for himself. \nMoments after she sat down, prosecutors homed in on what they see as the heaviest blow to Mr. Biden’s defense, in a series of texts showing that he bought and smoked crack in the 48 hours after he purchased a gun in Delaware. The testimony was intended to nail down a clear prosecutorial timeline, which Mr. Biden’s lawyers later undermined. But it also had the effect of forcing, Ms. Biden, a recovering addict, to revisit days of desperation and shame, so traumatic that it seemed to dim her memory. She was clearly shaken, repeatedly scanning the gallery for her new husband’s face among the crowd of gawking reporters. \nMs. Biden, 50, is by far the most important witness for the government. She is one of the few able to offer a detailed, and intimate, accounting of Mr. Biden’s all-consuming addiction to crack cocaine. He is on trial on charges of lying about his drug use on a form to buy a gun in October 2018, and of illegally possessing the weapon. \nThis article is by Glenn Thrush, Eileen Sullivan and Zach Montague. \n“I’m embarrassed and ashamed and I regret that part of my life.” \nMs. Biden — speaking in nervous, clipped bursts — admitted she had smoked crack after President Biden’s youngest son had introduced her to the drug in the summer of 2018, before quitting a few months later. At the time, the \nWILMINGTON, Del. — Hallie Biden walked briskly to the witness box, past her brother-in-law and ex-boyfriend Hunter Biden, to chronicle a star-crossed relationship that ended in anguish, her own addiction and, eventually, his criminal prosecution. \n“It was a terrible experience that I went through,” said Ms. Biden, a former school counselor. \nThe defendant nodded in affirmation, almost imperceptibly, as she spoke. \n# \nContinued on Page A19 \n\nA woman held the hand of a dead boy in central Gaza Thursday. \nThis was the scene one afternoon in late May at a military hangar inside Sde Teiman, an army base in southern Israel that has become synonymous with the detention of Gazan Palestinians. Most Gazans captured since the start of the war on Oct. 7 have been brought to the site for initial interrogation, according to the Israeli military. \nThe military, which has not previously granted access to the media, allowed The New York Times to briefly see part of the detention Continued on Page A12 \nThey were barred from talking more loudly than a murmur, and forbidden to stand or sleep except when authorized. \n# \nSDE TEIMAN, Israel — The men sat in rows, handcuffed and blindfolded, unable to see the Israeli soldiers who stood watch over them from the other side of a mesh fence. \nA few knelt in prayer. One was being inspected by a paramedic. Another was briefly allowed to remove his handcuffs to wash himself. The hundreds of other Gazan detainees sat in silence. They were all cut off from the outside world, prevented for weeks from contacting lawyers or relatives. \n# \nSAID IT HID MILITANTS \nOfficials in Gaza Count Women and Children Among the Dead \nThis article is by Aaron Boxerman, Abu Bakr Bashir, Erika Solomon and Thomas Fuller. \nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said he was “not aware of any civilian casualties” resulting from the strike. “We conducted a precise strike against the terrorists where they were,” he said. He said the militants had used the compound to plan attacks on Israeli forces, although he did not provide specific examples. \nThe precise toll could not be verified. The Gaza Health Ministry said that of the roughly 40 people killed in the attack, 14 were children and nine were women. Later, The Associated Press reported different numbers, saying at least 33 people died, including three women and nine children, citing the hospital morgue. \nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets had targeted three classrooms in the school building that held 20 to 30 Palestinian militants affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militia that, like Hamas, is backed by Iran. Israeli forces had twice postponed the strike to reduce civilian casualties, the military said. \nAn Israeli airstrike on Thursday hit a United Nations school complex in central Gaza that had become a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinians and, Israel said, Hamas militants. Gazan health officials said dozens of people were killed, including women and children. \nCrowds gathered at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah, a city in central Gaza, to weep and pray over the dead. A local Palestinian videographer posted footage showing a young woman with the body of her small son. \nThe strike was the latest in a deadly surge of fighting in central Gaza, where Israeli forces have announced an offensive against what they describe as a renewed insurgency by Hamas. \nThe strike hit a compound that had been operated by UNRWA, the main U.N. body that aids Palestinians in Gaza. About 6,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the complex, in the central Gaza area of Nuseirat, when it was struck, said Juliette Touma, an UNRWA spokeswoman. \nIsraeli security agencies have so far verified the identities of nine militants killed in the strike, $^{66}\\mathrm{{some}^{93}}$ of whom participated in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, Ad\n“They pinpointed the three classrooms, waited three days and then killed,” he added. \nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, another Israeli military spokesman, said Israeli forces had followed the militants for three days before opening fire. \n# \nContinued on Page A11 \n# \n# \n# \nHow an A.I.
