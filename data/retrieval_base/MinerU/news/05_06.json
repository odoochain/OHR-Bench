Page A8. \n# \n# \n# \nFrank Stella, whose laconic pinstripe “black paintings” of the late 1950s closed the door on Abstract Expressionism and pointed the way to an era of cool minimalism, died on Saturday at his home in the West Village of Manhattan. He was 87. \nHis wife, Dr. Harriet E. McGurk, said the cause was lymphoma. Mr. Stella was a dominant figure in postwar American art, a restless, relentless innovator whose explorations of color and form made him an outsize presence, endlessly discussed and constantly on exhibit. \n\nFew American artists of the 20th century arrived with quite his éclat. He was in his early 20s when his large-scale black paintings — precisely delineated black stripes separated by thin lines of blank canvas — took the art world by storm. Austere, self-referential, opaque, they cast a chilling spell. \nWriting in Art International magazine in 1960, the art historian William Rubin declared himself “almost mesmerized” by the “eerie, magical presence” of the paintings. Time only ratified the consensus. \n“They remain some of the most unforgettable, provocative paintings in the recent history of American Modernism,” the critic Karen Wilkin wrote in The New Criterion in 2007.

This year, that’s not necessarily the case. Because of a disastrous rollout of the new application for federal tuition aid, many still don’t know how much tuition they would be paying and so have not decided where they can afford to go. \nThe Education Department’s redesigned form for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was supposed to make applying for tuition aid easier and more accessible. But faced with a bureaucratic mess caused by technical meltdowns and severe delays in processing information and receiving aid packages, students say the new system has been anything but clear or streamlined. \nThe first signs of trouble began in December with the form’s release and have cascaded since, creating uncertainties for students — with graduation right around the corner. \n“It’s been a nightmare from point A to point B,” said Reyna Atkinson, a 17-year-old from Michigan, who ultimately committed to Michigan State University after months of waiting. \nFAFSA is a free, standardized application for federal aid for college tuition that millions rely on. Students fill out one form, with details on their background and Continued on Page A15 \n# \n# \nThe first time Tom Mathe, head bartender at L’Avenue in Manhattan, saw a child order a mocktail, he didn’t know what to think. \n“There was this initial impulse of, ‘Wait, is this $\\mathrm{OK}?^{,}$ he said. “I wouldn’t explicitly target children as a demographic when I make any kind of drink.” \nYet he has noticed more children asking for nonalcoholic drinks. “It’s not exactly daily, but more than weekly,” he said. \nThe restaurant, which sits inside Saks Fifth Avenue, has two spirit-free concoctions on the menu. Most children get the “Mr. Tastee,” Mr. Mathe said, which comes with coconut, vanilla, bergamot orange and soda. It makes sense, he added, considering that he created it with his own childhood in mind: “It reminds me of waiting for an ice cream truck.” \nHe ultimately decided that while it still feels a little strange to serve the sophisticated beverages to children, it felt satisfying to con\n# \ntribute to family dining experiences “in an interesting way.” As nonalcoholic cocktails, wines and beers have become staples on bar menus across America, some children — people way under the legal drinking age — have begun to partake. \nTechnically, there is no reason they can’t. Though some contain very small traces of alcohol — or at least mimic the taste of alcohol — many nonalcoholic beverages are made solely of juices and other kid-friendly ingredients. \n\nBut parents and hospitality professionals alike are asking whether this trend is problematic anyway — financially, ethically or for health reasons. \nIn a recent Reddit conversation, some parents compared serving their children spirit-free drinks to Continued on Page A15 \n# \nPrisons Struggle in Dual Role of Jailer and Caregiver for Thousands of People \n# \nHe did not resist.

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him, his face to the concrete, to cuff his hands behind his back. \n“I didn’t do anything,” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders. \nIt was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6, 2019, in the Danville Correctional Center, a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson, 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession, was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated, but hardly unwatched. \nHe had entered in good health, with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks, Mr. Johnson, who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all, he had stealthily stopped drinking water, hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises. \nbehind bars as in hospitals. Estimating the population of incarcerated people with major psychological problems is difficult, but the number is likely 200,000 to 300,000, experts say. \nIn 2021, Joshua McLemore, a 29-year-old with schizophrenia held for weeks in an isolation cell in Jackson County, Ind., died of organ failure resulting from a “refusal to eat or drink,” according to an autopsy. In April, New York City agreed to pay \\$28 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of Nicholas Feliciano, a young man with a history of mental illness who suffered severe brain damage after attempting to hang himself on Rikers Island — as correctional officers stood by. \nMany of these institutions remain ill-equipped to handle such a task, and the burden often falls on prison staff and health care personnel who struggle with the dual roles of jailer and caregiver in a high-stress, dangerous, often dehumanizing environment. \nMr. Johnson’s mother has filed a wrongful-death suit against the state and Wexford Health Sources, a for-profit health care contractor in Illinois prisons.

They wanted his take on a debate that had been gnawing at them. Their friends from a local public high school had been talking about discrimination against Latinos. Did the pastor agree? Does the government give white people more power? \n“No, no, no. That’s not true. We are not in oppression. Everybody here has the same rights,” Mr. Perez recalled telling the boys in a mini-sermon that hit on some of his favorite themes: freedom in the United States, scarcity and repression in Latin America and the dangers of what he views as liberals’ notions of victimhood. \n“This is an agenda against the country,” he told them. “They are trying to put confusion in your mind, and they are trying to bully you to be against your country, against everything.” \nIt is a path traversed by a growing number of Latino evangelicals, a group that is helping reContinued on Page A12 \nIt was not the first time the pastor’s counsel was more worldly than spiritual.

As much of official Washington is bracing for the possibility that former President Donald J. Trump really could return — this time with “retribution” as his avowed mission — the discussion is where people might go into a sort of self-imposed exile. \nWhether they mean it or not, the buzz is a telling indicator of the grim mood among many in the nation’s capital these days. The “what if” goes beyond the normal prospect of a side unhappy about a lost election.
