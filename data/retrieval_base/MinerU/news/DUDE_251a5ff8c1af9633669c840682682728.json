        "text": "# \n'Wide Window of Mr. Malone' Held Worthy of Oscar \n# \nIt is essentially an informative picture, and in its 27 minutes running time,it gives theviewer acapsule comprehension of how this great newspaper is produced how its far-flung correspondents diligently patrol their beats, gathering news and dispatching their stories and their interpretive observations to New York;and how thelocal staffs,editors and mechanical craftsmen assemble, arrange,compose and print the comprehensive publication that daily provides Mr.Malone with his windowupontheworld. \nThe agreeably poetic concept of the Times as a window through which the reader may scan the daily happenings of consequencethroughout theworldis neatlydevelopedin the contextofa dandy film about the making of The Times that George Pitt has put together under the title,“The Wide Window of Mr. Malone.\" \nBut it is this image of thepaper asa window-asoneof theseveraldevices through which a person may look and obtain ever-widening information about everything of importance that goes on— that gives the picture its filip,the nice metaphorical thrust thatmakes thebusiness ofproducinganewspaper seemmore importantand dramaticand bold. \n# \nThe trick is accomplished simply.Mr. Pitt has begun the film by introducing a typical Times reader, the titular George Malone.He is a young New York business executive who commutes from the suburbs and looks outuponhisimmediate worldfromseveralordinarywindowsbefore he opens the morning's Times.Then themagnitudeof thisexpansion isdramatically visualized by bringing a copy of The Times into theframing of ahigh picture window looking out upon the sweep of New York harbor.Thus the image is forcefullyimposed. \nFrom here on the substance of the picture is the story of The Times-a quick sketch of its history and expansion,from Henry J. Raymond through Adolph S. Ochs to the present;a series of tours with correspondents in London, Paris, Rome, Hong Kong, Tokyo; a fast look-in on metropolitan coverage and administrative activities in the city room; an indication of therange of special writers andpeople whomakeTheTimesgo. \nThe emphasis in the continuity and in the explanatory narration is upon the intricate organization and teamwork required and involved ingetting outabal\nThe editors assemble for the afternoon newsconference. \n# \nTHE WIDE WINDOW OF MR.MALONE,produced and directed by George Pitt;writtenby HarryMuheim； photography by Gordon Willis;edited byDick Jacobs;   \nmusic by Gino Marinuzzi,Jr.；narrated by Alexander   \nScourby.A Spectrum Associates Production.Running time:27minutes. GeorgeMalone .BillCassady and The staff of the New York Times. \nanced, clear newspaper every day against the tyranny of time. There is emphasis, too, upon the knowledge, judgment and sobrietyof those whowrite andedit the paper. No one wears a hat in the cityroom. \nIt isnotable that time isnot wasted and thepatienceof theviewerisnottaxed with perfunctory introductions and payment of respects to the top brass.Not one is evenmentioned in the picture.Nor isan editor orwriternamed-excepta few who are passingly identified in conversation,such as Ed O'Toole,whois spotted filing astory from Brussels on theEuropean Common Market,which storybecomes the exampleof howa storypassesfrom thewriterto theprinted page. \nThis process may be less clearly detailed than the literal-minded viewer might wish.And there are also some glaring omissionsof certainmajor operationsof The Times, such as the putting together of the Sunday sections-the Magazine, BookReview;theassembling ofthefinancial section, the gathering and handling of photographs.But omissions must be forgiven on the grounds of the limitation oftime.Andofcoursetheviewerswho will be most sensitive about them are those whosefunctions are not mentioned onthescreen. \nButagain the empathy of thepicture iswiththetotallycommittedteamthat collects andpresents this daily window for the service of Mr.Malone,who is re\nAs for Mr. Pitt's production,it is an eminentlyexpertjobofdocumentaryfilmmaking —— skillfully photographed, with camera-shy people directed to look and behave quite naturally;edited for good, sharp pace and movement, and packed intoacomfortablerunningtime.T The musical score of Gino Marinuzzi,Jr.,is subtly productive of proper moods,and Alexander Scourbydelivers thenarration as thoughhewereaworkingnewspaperman. \nvertedtoseveraltimesthrough thepicture.Thus the lasting impression of the wholeisoneofaweandadmirationfor everybodywhohelpstomakeTheTimes. \nNo single person in the“cast\"is likely to win an Oscar (outside of Sophia Loren, who pops upbrieflyin one clipasan exampleofwhataTimesreviewer enjoys).Claude Sitton is given a lot of footage and makes a good road-company JimmyStewart;TonyLewis indicates veryclearly thata correspondentlistens harder than he talks;Scotty Reston plays awickedtypewriter;AbeRosenthalchews a pipe judiciously and Dick Witkin gives a stirring indication of how Scoop the Young Reporter takes off. But no one is likely tobe snapped up toplaya newspaperman in a Hollywood film. We're all Working Press, not actors. That's a point to remember, Mr. Malone. \n# \nThe intention is to make this picture available for televisionshowings andfor nontheatricalreleasecn16mm. \n# \n“TheWideWindowof Mr.Malone\" hasn'twon an Oscar—yet—but this month it won for George Pitt,its producer，a bronze medal in the category of documentaries in the Fifth Annual New York Film and Television Festival. \n# \n(ContinuedfromPage1)   \nspots so the staff could follow the proceeding's. \nBy10o'clockMondaymorning,“Operation Instant Book'as the project came to be known,was under way.Rosenthal and Gelb,the editors in charge,were at their Bantam desk.
