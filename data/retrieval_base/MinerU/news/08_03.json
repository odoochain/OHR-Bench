Epstein and Katie Glueck. \nThe law firm hired by the Harris campaign to investigate potential vice-presidential candidates has completed its work, leaving the final decision — the most important yet of the still-new campaign — squarely in Vice President Kamala Harris’s hands. \nCovington & Burling, the Washington law firm tasked with the vetting, completed the job on Thursday afternoon and turned over its findings to Ms. Harris, according to two people briefed on the process. \nMs. Harris has blocked off several hours on her calendar this weekend to meet with the men being considered to join the ticket, according to two people who had viewed her schedule and who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private process. The Harris campaign has suggested it will announce the decision by Tuesday evening, when the vice president and her to-be-named running mate begin a five-day tour of presidential battleground states, starting in Philadelphia. \nSeveral of the contenders, including Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, canceled events this weekend, reflecting both a desire to be available for those conversations and to avoid drawing additional speculation from the news media about their chances. \nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Ms. Harris’s political career, one that can pay dividends in votes and years of counsel or backfire disastrously. In some ways, Ms. Harris is setting a direction for the future of the party, a reality she intimately understands given her own head-spinning ascension to the top of the ticket. \nBut unlike previous nominees, who spent months considering candidates, she must make her Continued on Page A16 \nSECURED Democrats said Kamala Harris had enough delegates to be the nominee.

It was there to chauffeur her to the Swiss Alps, where she and her colleagues would stay at the Tivoli Lodge, a seven-bedroom chalet that cost nearly half a million dollars to rent for the week. \nMs. Ellis, who was en route to the World Economic Forum in Davos, doesn’t run a Wall Street bank or a high-flying tech start-up.

Shear and Peter Baker. \nWASHINGTON — A turning point came on June 25, when a group of C.I.A. officers sat across from their Russian counterparts during a secret meeting in a Middle Eastern capital. \nThe Americans floated a proposal: an exchange of two dozen prisoners sitting in jails in Russia, the United States and scattered across Europe, a far bigger and more complex deal than either side had previously contemplated but one that would give both Moscow and Western nations more reasons to say yes. \nQuiet negotiations between the United States and Russia over a possible prisoner swap had dragged on for more than a year. They were punctuated by only occasional glimpses of hope for the families of the American prisoners — including Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and Paul Whelan, an American security contractor — growing increasingly impatient for their ordeal to end. Those hopes were always dashed when one of the two sides balked. \nThe Russian spies took the proposal back to Moscow, and only days later the C.I.A. director was on the phone with a Russian spy chief agreeing to the broad parameters of a massive prisoner swap. On Thursday, seven different planes touched down in Ankara, Turkey, and exchanged passengers, bringing to a successful close an intensive diplomatic effort that took place almost entirely out of public view. \nBut the June meeting changed things, according to accounts from American and Western officials and other people familiar with the long process of bringing the deal to fruition. \nThe deal between longtime adversaries — negotiated mostly by spies and sometimes through secret messages hand-delivered by couriers — secured the release of Mr. Gershkovich, Mr. Whelan and 14 other imprisoned Americans, Russians and Europeans. \n\nThe deal also freed, among others, a Russian hit man, Vadim Krasikov. He had been jailed in Germany since 2019 for the murder of a Chechen former separatist fighter in a park in Berlin. He was the prize most sought by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who had publicly praised the killing as an act of patriotism and for years had insisted that Mr. Krasikov be part of any swap. \nThe stunning deal took place against the geopolitical backdrop of the war in Ukraine, where the United States is sending weapons to the battlefront aimed at killing as many Russian troops as possible. \nAnd it reached its conclusion even as President Biden, who got personally involved in the negotiations at key points, was losing hope of continuing his re-election bid following a disastrous televised debate that took place two days after the C.I.A. gave the Russians what proved to be the decisive new offer. \nOn the morning of Sunday, July 21, Mr. Biden, sick with Covid, placed a call from his vacation home in Delaware to Slovenia’s prime minister to nail down one of the last pieces of the prisoner agreement. Less than two hours later, he announced he was withdrawing from the presidential race. \n“The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday in brief remarks from the White House, flanked by family members of the prisoners. He \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \n# \n# \nPARIS — As his nation’s lone athlete at the Paris Olympics, Winzar Kakiouea carries an additional burden: Most people have no idea that his country is a country. \nFirst, a brief geography primer: Nauru, with a population of less than 13,000, is an island nation perched in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Once known as Pleasant Island, Nauru (pronounced NO-roo, not Nah-oo-roo) gained its independence in 1968, after a period of trusteeship by the United Nations. Its economy for decades depended on guano, or bird poop, a key ingredient in fertilizer. Mining destroyed parts of the island; chunks of Nauru slid into the sea. Climate change is nibbling at its shores, too. \nAlso, his homeland could one day disappear into the ocean. \nOn Saturday, Kakiouea, 23, will compete in the preliminaries of the men’s 100 meters. He is a very fast runner — the fastest man in the expanse of the Pacific known as Micronesia — but it is probably safe to say that his Olympics will be over in fewer than 11 seconds. Still, Kakiouea’s presence in Paris is testament to one of the \n“Most people don’t know about Nauru,” Kakiouea said. “When I tell them about it, they are shocked that this little, tiny place is a country.” \nContinued on Page A9 \nFederal Reserve officials held off on cutting interest rates this week because they wanted to see slightly more data to feel confident that inflation is truly coming under control. While that approach is cautious when it comes to price increases, Friday’s employment report underscored that it might be a risky one when it comes to the job market. \nUnemployment rose to 4.3 percent in July, up from 4.1 percent previously, as hiring slowed sharply. The labor market cracks have given sudden urgency to concerns that the Fed has waited too long to begin cutting rates — and that it might be falling behind, allowing the job market to slow in a way that will be hard to stall or reverse. \n“They are absolutely behind the curve, and they need to catch up,” said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \nHigh Fed interest rates help to cool inflation by slowing demand. When it costs more to borrow to buy a house or expand a business, people make fewer big purchases and companies hire fewer workers. As economic activity pulls back, businesses struggle to raise prices as quickly, and inflation moderates. \nThat chain reaction can come at a serious cost to the job market, though.
