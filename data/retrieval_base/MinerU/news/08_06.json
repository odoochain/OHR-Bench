A day after about 100 people were killed in antigovernment protests, hundreds of thousands took to the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, defying a curfew imposed by the government and demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. \nThey got their wish. After 15 years of increasingly autocratic rule during which she crushed the opposition and brought the armed forces and the judiciary under her control, Ms. Hasina bowed to pressure and, according to the military, quit her post and fled the country in a helicopter. \nThe downfall of her government, in a country known for its messy and sometimes bloody polilabenasttste leue dnf coterh ratptao itwnhteeyrr  eab newtdi wlale lleb nbe  ulate  afgrdueeasrrhsoLfe ahgeru ep, oalintidc talh ep aBratyn, gtlahde eAshw aNma-i tionalist Party, its main opposition. \nIt remained unclear what role the military, which has seized power in the past, will play — or whether it had a hand in persuading Ms. Hasina to leave. On Monday afternoon, Gen.

Thousands were arrested and scores were killed. \nStudent leaders had initially called for a march on Tuesday, but decided to accelerate that timetdaabyl ea, ftmero vairnogu nthd e1 0e0v epnet otpol e Mdioendin clashes on Sunday.

Unlike “legal” spies operating under diplomatic cover in Russian embassies, they have no immunity from prosecution or obvious connections to Russia and are extremely hard to detect. \nVladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president and a former K.G.B. officer, “has thrown huge resources at this quite eccentric priority,” said Continued on Page A9 \nDISSENT A dissident released in the Russian prisoner swap says he didn’t want to leave.

And when she was done, standing alone in her sparkly leotard, the spectators rose to honor her — perhaps as much for her entire career as for a brilliant but flawed floor routine. [Page B7.] Biles stepped out of bounds twice during the routine, which was by far the most difficult that any of the finalists attempted. As a result, she did not win, as expected. Instead, she received the silver medal, while Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, her rival, won the gold by just over three-hundredths of a point. The American Jordan Chiles, one of Biles’s closest friends, won the bronze. When Chiles’s bronze medal was announced, she cried — and Continued on Page A7 \n\n# \n# \nJudge Rules Company Is Illegal Monopoly \nSENDING MIXED SIGNALS \n# \nJudge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in a 277-page ruling that Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, like Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers. \nWASHINGTON — Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge ruled on Monday, a landmark decision that strikes at the power of tech giants in the modern internet era and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business. \n“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Judge Mehta said in his ruling. \nThe ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology companies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume information and search online — and indicates a potential limit of Big Tech’s power. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago. \n“This is the most important antitrust case of the century, and it’s the first of a big slate of cases to come down against Big Tech,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University’s law school who studies antitrust. “It’s a huge turning point.” \nThe decision is a blow to Google, which was built on its search engine and has become so closely associated with search that its name has become a verb. The ruling could have major ramifications for Google’s success, especially as it spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence. Google faces another federal antitrust case over ad technology that is scheduled to go to trial next month. \nContinued on Page A17 \nS&P 500 Slumps 3% — Summer Lull Is Jolted by Recession Fear \nThis article is by Joe Rennison, Daisuke Wakabayashi and River Akira Davis. \nAnxiety over a slowdown in the U.S. economy intensified on Monday, with a retreat in markets that began last week snowballing into a global rout. \nThe turmoil was the latest example of how distinct economic forces can ricochet across markets, forcing down company stock prices and erasing billions of dollars in value. In this case, a rapidly rising yen over the past week had disrupted the flow of global capital, prompting a pullback from some popular investments. \nBut the sell-off quickly expanded into a more widespread panic that the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start cutting interest rates, threatening the strength of the U.S. economy. Those fears were amplified by a U.S. employment report released on Friday that showed significantly slower hiring by employers, with the unemployment rate rising to its highest level in nearly three years. From the moment stock markets first opened for trading in Asia, and then through trading hours in Europe and the United States on Monday, prices plummeted. \nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its sharpest daily de\nWhile some investors saw the sell-off as a signal that the economy was at risk of recession, others maintained that the move was more the result of a pullback from overextended bets, especially on tech stocks and artificial intelligence. Despite its recent decline, the S&P 500 is still up nearly 9 percent for the year, a healthy return. “Markets are a little bit out of control,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. “This is just total panic. It’s not real but it is painful, and it could be with us for a few weeks.” \nFew corners of the financial market were spared from the turmoil as investors cashed out and sought refuge from a broad-based slump. Oil futures, gold and cryptocurrencies were also swept up \nContinued on Page A16 \n# \n# \nSAN DIEGO — When Roy Cockrum, a onetime struggling actor and a former monk, won a s2no0a1rm4y,e: t hhsieun pgd peaoc ritbdiient dg o utnto o nosfp prltouhfreitg  eot rhdoein-- ater. \nHe set up a foundation that has given away \\$25 million to 39 American theaters so far, which is why he found himself the other night at the Old Globe in San Diego.
