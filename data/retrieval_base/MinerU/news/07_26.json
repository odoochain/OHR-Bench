Page A9. \n# \n# \nPARIS — Tara Davis-Woodhall, a long jumper by trade and an entertainer at heart, gazed into the stands at Tokyo’s 68,000-seat Olympic stadium and decided she needed some noise. In a quixotic bid to inject even a small dose of spirit into a pandemic-stricken Summer Games, she began clapping her hands theatrically. \nTens of people, give or take, clapped back. \n# \ncial partners and fans. “The tone is completely different,” said Sarah Hirshland, the chief executive of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We now have permission to have fun.” \nThe merrymaking had a head start on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony, with the Games’ soft opening: a small slate of soccer and rugby matches around the country. \nIt was merely an appetizer, but in a single sun-splashed afternoon at the Stade de France, just north of the capital, the Paris Games became everything the Tokyo Olympics were not. \nContinued on Page A8 \n“It was awful,” Davis-Woodhall said last month about the enforced emptiness of the Olympics three summers ago. “It was my first Olympics, and I was like, ‘What the heck? This is weird!’ I’m glad it’s over, and I’m glad that I’m going to Paris to actually experience an Olympics.” \nCountless athletes like DavisWoodhall — those who have competed in an Olympics but not truly experienced one — have arrived in Paris this month in search of the same thing: normal Games. \nBecause normalcy, at the Olympics, is grandeur. It is the distinct cocktail of sound and color produced by the gathering of more than 200 national teams and millions of fans. It is athletes climbing into the stands to celebrate with family and friends, or to be consoled by them. It is crowds cheering for sports they do not typically watch. \nAll of this was missing at the coronavirus-delayed Summer Games in Tokyo in 2021 and the Winter Games in Beijing a year later. Both were sequestered from society and almost entirely denuded of life and fervor. \nThe International Olympic Committee and its member nations keenly understood all that was lost. They have sensed an opportunity in Paris to restore that Olympic feeling, to re-establish how the Games should look and feel and to welcome back commer\n\nThe stands at the Stade de France were jammed with fans for an early round of rugby sevens on Wednesday at the Paris Games. \n# \n# \nSACRAMENTO — Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered California state officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, the nation’s most sweeping response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets. \nMore than in any other state, homeless encampments have been a wrenching issue in California, where housing costs are among the nation’s highest, complicating the many other factors that contribute to homelessness. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, and most of them were unsheltered. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing. \nMr. Newsom, a Democrat, called on state officials and local leaders to “humanely remove encampments from public spaces” and act “with urgency,” prioritizing those that most threaten health and safety. \nSome of his own agencies are expected to take action immediately on state property. He cannot force local governments to sweep encampments, but can exert political pressure through the billions of dollars that the state controls for municipalities to address homelessness. \nHis executive order could divide Democratic local leaders in California. Some have already begun to clear encampments, while others have denounced the decision from the majority conservative Supreme Court as opening Continued on Page A11 \n# \n# \nWith a knack for brokering luxury properties, Tal and Oren Alexander, brothers who worked as real estate agents, rose as high as the New York City penthouses they sold. \nThey built an image as jet-setting bachelors, filling their social media feeds with photos from \nWimbledon, Art Basel and the beach in Mykonos. They took calls in between ice baths after sessions with their personal trainers. Their traditional good looks and magnetism attracted ultrarich clients who propelled the brothers past thousands of other agents to the very top of the ranks at Douglas Elliman, one of the largest real estate brokerages in the country. \n# \nBut as the brothers partied and sold co-ops and condos from Manhattan to Miami, they were quietly earning another reputation: Accusations that they drugged and sexually assaulted women were spreading throughout the world of high-end real estate. \n\nStill, Tal and Oren continued to climb. They secured rarefied status in 2019 when they helped broker the sale of a nearly \\$240 million penthouse — at the time, the most expensive residential sale in United States history.

Her fund-raisers, armed with a new Harris logo, went to work. \nMajor fund-raisers — one of whom told President Biden’s campaign just days ago that he thought the campaign could count on only about 25 percent of its allied donors to support Mr. Biden — are now swamped with a flood of interest from donors. \nMs. Harris has no time to waste, having taken over the top of the Democratic ticket with just over 100 days to go and without the years of lead time that Mr. Biden had to cultivate major donors, soothe them and coax them to hand over their money. \nHarris campaign officials spent Tuesday and Wednesday energizing their supporters from Beverly Hills to the Hamptons. \nOn Wednesday, about 40 highpowered finance and Big Law executives joined a Zoom call organized by the superlawyer Brad Karp, the former New York City mayoral candidate Ray McGuire and a few others to discuss how Wall Street could best support a Harris ticket. Speakers included Rufus Gifford, the campaign’s finance chair, and donors inquired about Ms. Harris’s position on Israel, her posture on the economy and her selection of a running mate, according to two people on the call. \nIn Hollywood, Harris campaign officials joined calls on Tuesday and Wednesday with people from across the creative and entertainment industry to talk about fundraising and organize celebrities on behalf of the Harris campaign, according to two people with knowledge of the outreach. \n“Donors are calling asking how and where can I contribute to Harris for President,” said Andy Spahn, a top fund-raiser in Hollywood. He added that there was “tremendous excitement and enthusiasm for Kamala’s candidacy here.” \nContinued on Page A14 \nBig Gains for Democrats From Nonwhite and Younger Voters \nThis article is by Shane Goldmacher, Ruth Igielnik and Camille Baker. \nVice President Kamala Harris begins a 103-day sprint for the presidency in a virtual tie with former President Donald J. Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly reuniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Biden. \nJust days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process. \nOverall, Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in a head-tohead match. That is a marked improvement for Democrats when compared to the Times/Siena poll in early July that showed Mr. Biden behind by six percentage points, in the aftermath of the poor debate performance that eventually drove him from the race. \nThe survey provides a snapshot of the presidential race in the middle of one of the most volatile and unpredictable periods in modern American history. Democrats suddenly have a new nominee. And, less than two weeks after Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, his favorability rating rose to the highest level it has ever been in a national New York Times survey. \nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump’s significant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans. \nMr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 46 percent among registered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Mr. Biden in the post-debate poll. \nn some ways, the poll showe Continued on Page A12 \n# \n# \nRupert Murdoch is locked in a secret legal battle against three of his children over the future of the family’s media empire, as he moves to preserve it as a conservative political force after his death, according to a sealed court document obtained by The New York Times. \nMr. Murdoch, 93, set the drama in motion late last year, when he made a surprise move to change the terms of the Murdochs’ irrevocable family trust to ensure that his eldest son and chosen successor, Lachlan, would remain in charge of his vast collection of television networks and newspapers. \nThe trust currently hands control of the family business to the four oldest children when Mr. Murdoch dies. But he is arguing in court that only by empowering \nLEON NEAL/GETTY IMAGES Rupert Murdoch at the R.N.C. \nLachlan to run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings can he preserve its conservative editorial bent, and thus protect its commercial value for all his heirs. \nThose three siblings — James, Elisabeth and Prudence — were caught completely off guard by Continued on Page A18 \n\n# \nLife Among Ukraine’s Ruins A Kharkiv enclave started to rebuild after devastating bombings; then attacks resumed.
