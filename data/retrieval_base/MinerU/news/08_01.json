LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nAfter years of digging pipes and cisterns, not to mention suffering the slights of skeptics, Paris finally saw Olympic athletes dive into the Seine on Wednesday for the women’s and men’s triathlons.

The friendly trash talk was captured on camera and eventually watched by more than 15 million people online. \nOn one hand, the table tennis players said, it was one of those extraordinary, and extraordinarily funny, interactions that can happen only at the Olympics. On the other hand, they said, they have interactions like this all the time. \nEverywhere they go, the world’s best table tennis players meet strangers who believe they can hold their own against them. They tell them they play “PingPong,” too. They wonder aloud what the score would be, or even who would win. They suggest that they should play sometime. \nThis, alas, is the table tennis players’ cross to bear. \n“You’ll meet someone, and their first reaction is, ‘I bet I can beat you, let’s play,’” Zhang said, laughing. “I don’t think you’d really say that to anyone in another sport. If you saw Michael Phelps, I don’t think you’d say, ‘I bet I can beat you in a race.’” \nZhang, 28, and her fellow players are good sports about it. They have to be. They know their game doesn’t have a huge following. They know many people think of it only as an idle pastime — and that Continued on Page A8 \nThis article is by Jonathan Weisman, Maya King and Zolan KannoYoungs. \nCHICAGO — Former President Donald J.

The strike on Beirut was the first time during this war that Israel has targeted such an influential Hezbollah leader in Lebanon’s capital. Hours later, the killing in Iran of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was considered the most brazen breach of Iran’s defenses in years. \nTaken together, the seniority of the targets, the sensitive location of the strikes and their near simultaneity were viewed as a particularly provocative escalation that has left the region fearing an even bigger response from Iran and its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq. The scale of that reaction could determine whether the low-level regional battle between Israel and the Iranian alliance tips into a full-scale, all-out conflict. \nIranian military commanders are considering a large combination attack of drones and ballistic missiles on military targets in Israel but would avoid striking civilian targets, three Iranian officials have said. \nStill, while Iran and Hezbollah are likely to respond, they may yet choose methods that give Israel room to avoid further retaliation, at least for now, some analysts said. For months, Hezbollah has appeared wary of a war that would quite likely devastate Lebanon, while Iran — whose leadership has already said it will respond forcefully — may want to avoid actions that draw the United States into the conflict more directly. Both parties may also decide to view each assassination as a distinct event, rather than as a combined attack that requires a massive, joint \nresponse, analysts said. Hezbollah will face pressure to respond because the strike on Continued on Page A6 \nThis article is by Patrick Kingsley, Adam Rasgon, Farnaz Fassihi and Ronen Bergman. \nJERUSALEM — The predawn killing of a top Hamas leader in Tehran on Wednesday left the entire Middle East on edge, bringing vows of revenge from Iran’s leaders and threatening to derail fragile negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire. \nThe Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, 62, a top negotiator in the cease-fire talks who had led the militant group’s political office in Qatar, was killed after he and other leaders of Iranian-backed militant groups had attended the inauguration of Iran’s new president. \nIsraeli leaders would not confirm or deny whether their country was behind the brazen breach of Iran’s defenses. But Iranian leaders and Hamas officials immediately blamed Israel and vowed to avenge the death of Mr. Haniyeh, heightening fears of a broader regional war. \nARASH KHAMOOSHI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES In Tehran, protesting the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. \n\nIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued an order for Iran to strike Israel directly, according to three Iranian officials briefed on the order. \nAnd Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said in a statement on Wednesday, a day after he was sworn into office with Mr. Haniyeh seated in the front row: “We will make the occupying terrorist regime regret its action. Iran will defend its sovereignty, dignity, reputation and honor.” \nIn recent years, Israel has carried out several high-profile assassinations in Iran, rattling the country’s leaders. In November, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told reporters that he had ordered the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, to “act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are.” \nHours before the killing of Mr. Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, Israeli fighter jets had carried out a Continued on Page A6 \n# \n# \nIn the early days of the pandemic in 2020, traffic stops by the police plummeted around the country, as fewer cars were on the road and as agencies instructed officers to avoid nonessential contact with the public. \nBut in the months and years that followed, a distinct pattern formed in many cities: The cars came back in full force, but the traffic enforcement didn’t. \nBy the end of 2023, the police in Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco were making fewer than half the traffic stops they did \n# \nprepandemic. In other police departments that don’t publicly track stops, like Seattle’s and New York’s, the citations given during stops dropped off, too. The downturn appears even among some state agencies that monitor road safety on highways, like the Texas Highway Patrol and the Connecticut State Police. \nThis decline, seen in an Upshot analysis of local law enforcement data, accelerated a shift that began in many places before the pandemic, suggesting that the police have pulled back from a part of their job that has drawn especially sharp criticism. To many communities, traffic stops have led to racial discrimination, burdensome fines and deadly encounters — not road safety. \n\nBut the retreat of law enforcement from American roadways has also occurred against the backdrop of a rise in road fatalities. \nIt’s hard to draw a straight line from the decline of enforcement to the rise of road deaths, but their likely connection has unsettled reContinued on Page A20 \n# \nGUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba — The man accused of plotting the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and two of his accomplices have agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and murder charges in exchange for a life sentence rather than a deathpenalty trial at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, prosecutors said Wednesday. \nProsecutors said the deal was meant to bring some “finality and justice” to the case, particularly for the families of nearly 3,000 people who were killed in the attacks in New York City, at the Pentagon and in a Pennsylvania field. \n# \nThe men have been in U.S. custody since 2003. But the case had become mired in more than a decade of pretrial proceedings that focused on the question of whether \nThe defendants Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi reached the deal in talks with prosecutors across 27 months at Guantánamo and approved on Wednesday by a senior Pentagon official overseeing the war court. \ntheir torture in secret C.I.A. prisons had contaminated the evidence against them. \nWord of the deal emerged in a letter from war court prosecutors to Sept. 11 family members. \n“In exchange for the removal of the death penalty as a possible punishment, these three accused have agreed to plead guilty to all of the charged offenses, including the murder of the 2,976 people listed in the charge sheet,” said the letter, which was signed by Rear Adm. Aaron C. Rugh, the chief prosecutor for military commissions and three lawyers on his team. \nContinued on Page A19 \n\n# \nLure of Ultraprocessed Foods Understanding why some of our favorite snacks are so easy to overeat might be key to making them less harmful, some researchers say.
