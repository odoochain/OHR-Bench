Within days, she was unbearably sensitive to light and struggled to remember simple facts. \nShe was 37, with a Ph.D. in neuroscience, and until then could ride her bicycle 20 miles, teach a dance class and give a lecture on artificial intelligence, all in the same day. Now, more than three \n“When I let myself think about the devastation of what this has done to my life, and how much I’ve lost, sometimes it feels even too hard to comprehend,” said Dr. Zimmerman, who believes her injury was a result of a contaminated vaccine batch. \nyears later, she lives with her parents. Eventually diagnosed with brain damage, she cannot work, drive or even stand for long periods of time. \nThe Covid vaccines, a triumph of science and public health, are estimated to have prevented mil\nThousands Think That Their Cases Have Been Ignored \nlions of hospitalizations and deaths. Yet even the best vaccines produce rare but serious side effects. And the Covid vaccines have been given to more than 270 million people in the United States, in nearly 677 million doses. \nDr. Zimmerman’s account is among the more harrowing, but thousands of Americans believe they suffered serious side effects following Covid vaccination. As of April, just over 13,000 vaccine-injury compensation claims had been filed with the federal government — but to little avail. Only 19 percent had been reviewed. Only 47 of those were deemed eligible for compensation, and only 12 had been paid out, at an average of about \\$3,600. \n\nSome scientists fear that patients with real injuries are being Continued on Page 22 \n# \nDecades of Takeovers, Tents and Tensions \n# \nThat scene played out 60 years ago at the University of California, Berkeley. The words were directed at the university leadership, and referring to its restrictions on campus political activity. But the speech, from the student leader Mario Savio, and the sit-in that followed could have happened yesterday. \nAn American college student looked out at a sea of protesters and spoke of a machine that had grown so “odious” that it had left people of good will little choice. There must be protest. \n“You’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop,” he said. Soon the students would flood into a campus administration building. \nThe protests against Israel’s war in Gaza that have erupted on college campuses around the United States are merely the latest in a tradition of student-led, left-leaning activism dating back at least to the civil rights and antiVietnam War protests of the 1960s. \nOften, the protests have played out on college campuses, and sometimes in the same building as previous years: Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, was taken over by students in the protests of 1968 as well as this past week and at least four times in between. Sometimes the protests have seemed to be off-campus adaptations, like the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations of 2011 or the racial justice demonstrations of recent years. \nLike today’s protests, most of the older movements were highly polarizing.

Putin’s promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine. \nRecruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and $\\$2,000$ a month $^{-10}$ times the national minimum wage — in return for serving in frontline roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia. \nThe military’s stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts. \nDozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that — along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions — suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts. \n“Combat experience and military specialties are not required,” read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia’s Tatarstan region. It offered training and a sign-up bonus equivalent to \\$4,000. “We have one goal — victory!” \nIt’s not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country. A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in \nUkraine also recruits women. \n# \n# \nDuring all of the years that the Olympics gave out medals in arts, not just athletics — and if you didn’t know about that, the rest of this article may hold more surprises — the pinnacle came in Paris, 100 years ago this summer. \nThe gold medal sculpture at the 1924 Paris Olympics was by a Greek artist named Costas Dimitriadis. His nude, arching, 7-foot “Discobole” (Discus Thrower) was for weeks displayed prominently in the Grand Palais. \nTwo years later, before “a crowd of light-frocked women and strawhatted men,” as The New York Times reported, the prized sculpture, cast in bronze, was planted just outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York’s Central Park. \n“A symbol of human perfection,” a museum official declared that day. \nThe statue did not stand still for long. Like the Olympic arts contests themselves, it went on quite a journey, largely to oblivion. \nFor decades, beginning with the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, the Olympics included competitions in painting, sculpture, architecture, music and literature — a “pentathlon of the Muses,” as Pierre de Coubertin, the founder and leader of the modern Olympics, called them. \n“From now on they will be part of each Olympiad, on a par with the athletic competitions,” Coubertin said. \nousands of artists, some of Continued on Page 33 \nJUSTIN CASTERLINE/GETTY IMAGES\nOne Nostril Edges Out Another ... and Another Mystik Dan, ridden by the jockey Brian J.

Page 30. \nThe Russian military’s need to replenish its ranks for what it presents as a long-term war against Ukraine and its Western allies, however, has clashed with Mr. Putin’s ideological struggle, which portrays Russia as a bastion of social conservatism standing up to the decadent West. \nMr. Putin has placed women at the core of this vision, portraying them as child-bearers, mothers and wives guarding the nation’s social harmony. \n“The most important thing for every women, no matter what profession she has chosen and what heights she has reached, is the family,” Mr. Putin said in a speech on March 8. \nThese clashing military and social priorities have resulted in contradictory policies that seek to recruit women to the military to fill a need, but send conflicting signals about the roles women can assume there. \n“I have gotten used to the fact that I am often looked at like a monkey, like, ‘Wow, she’s in faContinued on Page 8 \nGERRY BROOME/ASSOCIATED PRESS Fans of cicadas say they evoke nostalgia: a sound of summer. \n\n# \n# \nDES PLAINES, Ill. — As the third graders of Cumberland Elementary in the Chicago suburbs colored, clipped and glued paper to make cicadas with filmy wings, they confided their fears about what is about to happen in Illinois. \n“Some people think cicadas can suck your brains out,” said Willa, a red-haired 8-year-old in a Star Wars T-shirt. \n“They’re going to be so loud,” Christopher, 9, said as he colored his cicada intently. “I hate noise.” “It’s kind of scary,” Madison, 8, said while picking through markers scattered on a green table. “What if they do something to \nme?” \nNot to worry, Madison and Willa: Cicadas don’t actually bite, and they prefer to suck tree sap. (And Christopher, earplugs might come in handy.) \nIllinois is the center of the cicada emergence in the United States, the only state that will experience cicadas nearly everywhere and see two adjacent broods — Brood XIX, or the Great Southern Brood, and Brood XIII, or the Northern Illinois Brood — come up from the soil at once. The dual emergence of the two groups of cicadas is happening for the first time since 1803, and expected to last about six weeks. \n\nAny day now, scientists estimate, the state will be a carpet of buzzing, crawling, red-eyed in\n“What’s special about these two broods is that they cover almost the entirety of the state of Illinois,” said Allen Lawrance, associate curator of entomology at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago. “So for us in Illinois, you won’t be able to get away from them.” \nsects. \nContinued on Page 18 \n# \nAll In on Second Assemblyman Eddie Harlem went from prison to politics. reinvent themselves."
