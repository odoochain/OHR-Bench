The party is newly energized by the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris. And Mr. Jones, a former congressman, has stockpiled millions of dollars for a campaign centered on reminding voters that \n# \nMr. Lawler backs former President Donald J. Trump and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. \n“His support is largely based on an illusion of him,” Mr. Jones said, referring to Mr. Lawler’s reputation as a moderate. “Here in the Hudson Valley, you can expect Democrats to vote for Democrats.” \nAnd yet, with just a little over two months to go, Mr. Jones is struggling to translate those partisan advantages into an actual lead, setting off alarm bells in New York and Washington that the party is once again facing unusually stiff local headwinds with middle-of-the-road voters put off by the state’s leftward lurch. \n\nDemocrats have a parallel fight on their hands in what would otherwise be considered the friendly territory of the Antelope Valley in California.

He was charged on Wednesday with complicity in managing an online platform to enable illegal transactions by an organized group, which could lead to a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. He was also charged with complicity in crimes such as enabling the distribution of child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking and fraud, and refusing to cooperate with law enforcement. \nPARIS — Pavel Durov, the Russian-born entrepreneur who founded the online communications tool Telegram, was charged on Wednesday in France with a wide range of crimes for failing to prevent illicit activity on the app, and barred from leaving the country. \nHis indictment was a rare move by legal authorities to hold a top technology executive personally liable for the behavior of users on a major messaging platform, escalating the debate over the role of tech companies in online speech, privacy and security and the limits of their responsibility. \nLaure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor, said in a statement that Mr. Durov had been ordered to pay bail of 5 million euros, or about \\$5.5 million.

Col. Nadav Shoshani, said have become militant strongholds. The Israeli military said it had killed nine militants. \nThe operation followed months of escalating Israeli raids in the occupied territory, where nearly three million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel, according to the United Nations, in violence involving both the Israeli military and extremist Jewish settlers. Israel has also arrested thousands of Palestinians suspected of involvement in armed groups. \nA Palestinian armed group based in Jenin said it had fired on Israeli forces in two villages on the city’s outskirts, and Palestinian residents in both cities described hearing intermittent gunfire. \nThat increasingly deadly campaign has unfolded alongside Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, set off by the Oct. 7 attack, and the cross-border strikes traded with Hezbollah in Lebanon. \nThe raid comes as U.S., Israeli and Iranian officials have said that Tehran is operating a clandestine smuggling route across the Middle East to deliver weapons to Palestinians in the Israelioccupied territory. The goal, as described by three Iranian officials, has been to foment unrest against Israel by flooding the West Bank with as many weapons as it can, The New York Times reported in April. \n\nIsraeli ground troops this week have been pushing into Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and the Gazan health authorities said on Wednesday that Israeli strikes had killed 58 Palestinians in the enclave over the past day. \nThe military said on Wednesday that it had recovered the body of a soldier kidnapped on Oct. 7. It was not clear from the military’s statement whether the soldier had been taken to Gaza dead or still alive; it said it was withholding his name at the request of his family. \nA day earlier, Israeli troops rescued the hostage Farhan al-Qadi, whom they had found alone in a warren of tunnels they were investigating in the enclave. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, at least 30 of whom are presumed dead by the Israeli authorities. \nThe United Nations said on Wednesday that one of its vehicles in Gaza had been targeted by Israeli gunfire. It was $^{66}\\mathrm{a}$ clearly marked U.N. humanitarian vehicle, part of a convoy that had been fully coordinated” with the Israeli military, said Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman.

She was 96. \nHer death, in a hospital, was from cancer, her daughter, Kathy Halbreich, said. \nMs. Halbreich was revered by those in the know and anonymous to everyone else. It took expertise, and perhaps a bit of gumption, even just to find her. One would enter the imposing white marble building that the Bergdorf Goodman department store has occupied since the Jazz Age; stride past the crystal chandeliers of the lobby; navigate to a narrow, nondescript hallway on the third floor; and proceed to the end of it. \n\nThere lay Betty Halbreich’s Solutions. It was a little cream-colored office with a stunning view of the Plaza Hotel and the Pulitzer Fountain but also possessing some characteristics of a diner.
