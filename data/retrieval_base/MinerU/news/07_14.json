Trump before being spirited away by the Secret Service on Saturday in Butler, Pa. \n# \n# \nThe Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system. Their wide-ranging and methodical effort is laying the groundwork to contest an election that they argue, falsely, is already being rigged against former President Donald J. Trump. \nThe campaign involves a powerful network of Republican law\n# \nyers and activist groups, working loosely in concert with the Republican National Committee. Many of the key players were active in Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But unlike the chaotic and im\nMr. Trump’s allies have followed a two-pronged approach: restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and short-circuiting the process of ratifying the winner afterward, if Mr. Trump loses. The latter strategy involves an ambitious — and legally dubious — attempt to reimagine decades of settled law provised challenge four years ago, the new drive includes a systematic search for any vulnerability in the nation’s patchwork election system. \n\ndictating how results are officially certified in the weeks before the transfer of power. \nAt the heart of the strategy is a drive to convince voters that the election is about to be stolen, even without evidence. Democrats use mail voting, drop boxes and voter registration drives to swing elections, they have argued. And Mr. Trump’s indictments and criminal conviction are a Biden administration tactic to interfere with the election, they claim. \nContinued on Page 12 \nA Suspected Gunman and a Rally Attendee Are Killed \nThis article is by Michael Gold, Simon J. Levien and Julian E. Barnes. \nBUTLER, Pa. — Former President Donald J. Trump was injured in a shooting just minutes into his rally on Saturday in Butler, Pa., in what officials said they were investigating as an assassination attempt. \nA rallygoer was killed in the shooting and the suspected gunman was killed by the Secret Service, according to a federal official and two people also briefed on the matter. \nMr. Trump was “fine” and being treated at a hospital, according to a spokesman for his campaign. He was escorted off the stage by Secret Service agents, with his face and ear bloodied. As he was taken to his motorcade, he pumped his fist in a defiant gesture to the crowd. \nIn a statement, a spokesman for the Secret Service said that in addition to the rallygoer who was killed, two others were critically injured. The suspected gunman “fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside the rally venue,” the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said. \nIn a post on his social media site, Truth Social, Mr. Trump recounted the shooting. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote. “Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.” \nPresident Biden, in brief televised remarks on Saturday night, expressed gratitude that Mr. Trump had been swiftly evacuated and said “there’s no place in America for this kind of violence.” He also said he had tried to reach the former president. \nMr. Biden’s campaign said in a statement on Saturday night that it would pause “all outbound communications” and was working to “pull down our television ads as quickly as possible.” The move reflects a desire to put politics aside while the crisis of a likely assassination attempt on a presidential candidate plays out. \n\nMr. Trump had been showing supporters a chart of numbers about border crossings, which his audiovisual staff placed on screens above the stage, when the shots rang out. \nThe former president ducked quickly, with the sound coming from the bleachers to the left of where he was standing at a lectern. The noises came in two groups, and smoke rose from that section of the bleachers. \nAs members of the crowd began screaming, Mr. Trump was tackled by Secret Service agents. Officials shouted for the crowd to duck and cover, whisking members of the news media off the press riser where they had been watching Mr. Trump’s speech. \nTheresa Koshut, a teacher from Pittsburgh who was in the fifth row, said she immediately ducked when she heard the shots. Ms. Koshut was all too familiar with active-shooting drills from school. \n“I dropped and rolled under the bleachers,” she said. “I didn’t even think.” \nAfter a brief pause, Mr. Trump rose, surrounded by a group of uniformed Secret Service members. He pumped his fist to the crowd and then was rushed off the stage and ushered into his motorcade, which quickly left the venue, the Butler Farm Show, about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. \nAfter he departed, police officials began cordoning off the area with crime-scene tape as attendees began clearing out. Blood was visible on the bleachers. \nhose who attend Mr. Trump’ Continued on Page 13 \n\nWimbledon Winner Barbora Krejcikova held off Jasmine Paolini to claim her first singles title at the event.

Epstein. \nWASHINGTON — When aides to President Biden heard in recent days that George Clooney, as close a figure as there is in Hollywood to royalty, planned to publicly break with Mr. Biden in an essay that cast doubt on his re-election chances, panic set in from Wilmington to Beverly Hills. \nCould Mr. Clooney be persuaded not to publish it? The movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg sought to intervene. Mr. Katzenberg, who moonlights as a top Biden official and has worked with Mr. Clooney on philanthropy for decades, reached out to him to see if there was an off-ramp, according to three people familiar with the matter. There was not — Mr. Clooney published his essay in The New York Times, and the president’s relationship with Hollywood was torn asunder. \n\nThe fallout from the Clooney essay has ricocheted across the worlds of politics and entertainment — and onto Mr. Katzenberg himself. It has turned Hollywood, America’s drama capital, into ground zero for the impasse between the Biden campaign and the major donors who increasingly do not want it to proceed. \n\n“This is a town that pays attention to box office, and the numbers do not look encouraging right now,” said Billy Ray, the screenwriter behind “The Hunger Games” and other films who has worked with Democratic candidates on messaging. “I do think they’re going to have a challenge Continued on Page 14 \n\n# \nThis article is by Ronen Bergman, Patrick Kingsley and Adam Rasgon. \nThe Gaza Health Ministry said that 90 people had been killed in the assault, half of them women and children, and 300 wounded. The commander targeted in the attack, Muhammad Deif, is the leader of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing. He is the second most senior Hamas figure in Gaza, after its leader in the territory, Yahya Sinwar. \nSpeaking to reporters Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel confirmed that Israeli forces had tried to assassinate Mr. Deif but that Israel did not yet have “absolute clarity” as to whether he had been killed. Hamas said in a statement that Israel’s “allegations about targeting leaders are false,” and are “merely to cover up the scale of the horrific massacre.” \nTEL AVIV — Israel conducted a major airstrike in southern Gaza on Saturday morning that it said had targeted a top Hamas military commander who is considered one of the architects of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to six senior Israeli officials. \nAs of Saturday night, the status of Mr. Deif and Rafah Salameh, the leader of Hamas forces in Khan Younis, who Israeli officials say was also targeted in the attack, was unclear. \nThe strike hit a strip of coastal land known as Mawasi, which IsContinued on Page 7 \n# \nThis article is by Patrick Kingsley, Natan Odenheimer, Aaron Boxerman, Adam Sella and Iyad Abuheweila. \nThey emerge from hiding in plain clothes, sometimes wearing sandals or tracksuits, before firing on Israeli troops, attaching mines to their vehicles or firing rockets from launchers in civilian areas. They rig abandoned homes with explosives and tripwires, sometimes luring Israeli soldiers to enter the booby-trapped buildings by scattering signs of a Hamas presence. \nThrough eight months of fighting in Gaza, Hamas’s military wing — the Qassam Brigades — has fought as a decentralized and largely hidden force, in contrast to its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which began with a coordinated largescale maneuver in which thousands of uniformed commandos surged through border towns and killed roughly 1,200 people. \nJERUSALEM — They hide under residential neighborhoods, storing their weapons in miles of tunnels and in houses, mosques, sofas — even a child’s bedroom — blurring the boundary between civilians and combatants. \nInstead of confronting the Israeli invasion that followed in frontal battles, most Hamas fighters have retreated from their bases and outposts, seeking to blunt Israel’s technological and numerical advantage by launching surprise attacks on small Continued on Page 6 \n# \n\nANJA NIEDRINGHAUS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE Dr. Ruth in 2000.
