Not through the phone calls or the emissaries or the public statements or the joint committee meetings. And so, frustrated that he was being ignored, President Biden chose a more dramatic way of making himself clear to Israeli leaders. He stopped sending the bombs. \nMr. Biden’s decision to pause the delivery of 3,500 bombs to Israel was meant to convey a powerful signal that his patience has limits. While insisting that his support for the Jewish state remains “ironclad,” Mr. Biden for the first time since the Gaza war erupted last fall opted to use his power as Israel’s chief arms supplier to demonstrate his discontent. \nThe hold on the bombs represents a significant turning point in the 76-year-old relationship between the United States and Israel, historically one of the closest security partnerships in the world. But it may not necessarily be a breaking point. The Biden administration is still allowing most other weapons to be sent to Israel, and in fact officials emphasized that no fina decision has even been made on the bombs that are currently in limbo. \nMr. Biden hopes the selective pause will prompt Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to forgo a long-threatened Continued on Page A9 \n# \nThis article is by Dana Goldstein, Troy Closson and Michael Levenson. WASHINGTON — A Republican-led House committee turned its attention to three of the most politically liberal school districts in the country on Wednesday, accusing them of tolerating antisemitism, but the district leaders pushed back forcefully, defending their schools. \nThe hearing was the third by House Republicans to expose what they see as a pro-Palestinian agenda gripping schools and college campuses since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. \nDuring the contentious twohour session, Republicans accused the district leaders — from New York City; Berkeley, Calif.; and Montgomery County, Md. — of “turning a blind eye” to anti\n# \nEnikia Ford Morthel, the superintendent of Berkeley schools, acknowledged some incidents in her schools but pointedly stated that “antisemitism is not pervasive in Berkeley Unified School District.” David C. Banks, the New York City schools chancellor, said the repeatedly hostile questions from the panel suggested it was trying to elicit “gotcha moments” rather than solve the problem of antisemitism. \n# \n“We cannot simply discipline our way out of this problem,” he said. “The true antidote to ignorance and bias is to teach.” \n\nThe hearing came about five months after a hearing on antisemitism in which the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania gave lawyerly statements, prompting an intense backlash that helped lead to their resignations. \nBut on Wednesday, Republicans did not appear to elicit similarly damaging moments. \nNor did the school leaders’ answers appear to prompt widespread anger back in their communities, as happened when Nemat Shafik, the president of Columbia, testified before Congress last month. Her promise to crack down on protesters seemed to mollify Republicans, at least temporarily, but deepened discontent Continued on Page A15 \nAMANDA ANDRADE-RHOADES FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\n“We cannot simply discipline our way out of this problem,” Chancellor David C. Banks said. \n# \n# \nBalloons released in the sky don’t go to heaven. They often end up in oceans and waterways, where they’re 32 times more likely to kill seabirds than other types of plastic debris. Despite this, humans like to release them en masse, be it to celebrate a loved one’s life or a wedding, or to reveal the gender of a baby. \nThe practice is on the verge of becoming illegal in Florida, where the legislature has joined a growing number of states to ban the intentional release of balloons outdoors. The Florida ban is expected to be signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and would take effect July 1. \n\nFlorida is at the forefront of a dizzying and contentious array of statewide bans, outlawing labgrown meat, certain books from school libraries and classrooms, and most abortions after six \nFlorida Set to Prohibit Willfully Letting Go weeks. But the balloon ban is rare for garnering widespread bipartisan support. It was championed by environmentalists and sponsored by two Republican lawmakers from the Tampa Bay area, Linda Chaney, a state representa\n\n“Balloons contribute to the increase in microplastic pollution, which is harmful to every living thing, including humans, polluting our air and drinking water,” Ms. Chaney wrote in an email. “My hope is that this bill changes the culture, making people more aware of litter in general, including balloons,” she said.

Many places have no running water, flushing toilets or garbage pickup. \nThe lucky ones are sleeping on a friend’s sofa. \n“There are kids at my camp who have no parents,” said Agenithe Jean, 39, who left her home in the Carrefour-Feuilles neighborhood of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, in August for an improvised camp in an empty lot about six miles away. “We need latrines. We need somewhere to go.” At least 360,000 people — more than half of them in the capital or surrounding neighborhoods — have fled their homes in Haiti over the past year, and that number of internally displaced people is expected in the coming months to surpass 400,000, according to the U.N.’s International Office for Migration. \nHundreds are unaccompanied children, including orphans and others separated from their parents in the chaos. \nAbout 90,000 people are living in those sites, and roughly the same number deserted Port-auPrince in March, according to the United Nations and aid groups, many for other parts of Haiti, an exodus straining safer cities illprepared for an increased demand on water, food and schools. A United Nations drive to raise \\$674 million to address the growing list of basic needs in Haiti has collected just 16 percent of the goal. The United States provided \\$69.5 million of the \\$107 million raised so far. \nAs hurricane season nears, humanitarian groups and Haiti’s disaster response office are racing to figure out how to address the swelling crowds living in improvised shelters in a capital overrun by gangs with a barely functioning national government. \nThe competition for attention and resources can be eclipsed by crises around the world, including in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, aid groups said. The response has paled in comparison to the massive international effort following Haiti’s cataclysmic 2010 earthquake, when countries and aid organizations sent billions in aid. \nContinued on Page A12 \nParties Band Together, Turning Back Greene and the Far Right \nWASHINGTON — Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday easily batted down an attempt by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to oust him from his post, after Democrats linked arms with most Republicans to fend off a second attempt by G.O.P. hard-liners to strip the gavel from their party leader. \nThis article is by Catie Edmondson, Carl Hulse and Kayla Guo. \nThis time, the Democratic support made the critical difference, allowing Mr. Johnson, who has a minuscule majority, to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P. speaker, 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward. \nThe vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43, with seven voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue, with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him. \nMembers of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker, and when the last Republican to hold the post, Kevin McCarthy, faced a removal vote last fall, Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him, helping lead to his historic ouster. \nThat was the same number of Republicans who voted in October to allow the bid to remove Mr. McCarthy to advance — but back then, they were joined by every Democrat. \n“I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,” Mr. Johnson told reporters shortly after Wednesday’s vote. “As I’ve \nContinued on Page A18 \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson easily defeated a “misguided effort.” \n# \n# \n“I’m like, What the hell is going on? Put it back. What are you doing?” he recalled. \nMariano Torres, a maintenance worker at Columbia University, was cleaning on the third floor of Hamilton Hall in his signature Yankees cap one night last week when he heard a commotion downstairs. He said he figured it had something to do with the proPalestinian encampment on the lawn outside and kept working. He was shocked, he said, when he suddenly saw five or six protesters, their faces covered by scarves or masks, picking up chairs and bringing them into the stairway. \n\nHe said he tried to block them and they tried to reason with him to get out of the way, telling him “this is bigger than you.” One person, he recalled, told him he didn’t get paid enough to deal with this. Someone tried to offer him “a fistful of cash.” \n\nHe said he replied: “I don’t want your money, dude. Just get out of the building.” \nIt was the beginning of what would be a frightening time for Mr. Torres and two other maintenance workers in Hamilton Hall, who were inside when pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia took over the building. \nJust as upsetting as their encounters with the protesters, the three workers recounted in interviews this week, was their feeling that the university had not done \nContinued on Page A14 \n\n# \nDoes That Come With Fries?
