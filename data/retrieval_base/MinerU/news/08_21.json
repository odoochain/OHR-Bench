Regulator of Health Devices Whose Wife Represented Their Makers \n# \nWhen he announced in July that he would be retiring from the Food and Drug Administration later this year, Dr. Robert Califf, the agency’s commissioner, praised him for overseeing the approval of more novel devices last year than ever before in the nearly half-century history of the device division. But the admiration for Dr. Shuren is far from universal. Consumer advocates see his tenure as marred by the approval of too many devices that harmed patients and by his own close ties to the \\$500 billion global device industry. \nFor 15 years, Dr. Jeffrey E. Shuren was the federal official charged with ensuring the safety of a vast array of medical devices including artificial knees, breast implants and Covid tests. \nOne connection stood out: While Dr. Shuren regulated the booming medical device industry, his wife, Allison W. Shuren, represented the interests of device \n\nDr. Jeffrey E. Shuren will retire from the F.D.A. later this year. \nmakers as the co-leader of a team of lawyers at Arnold & Porter, one of Washington’s most powerful law firms. \nDr. Shuren signed ethics agreements obtained by The New York Times that were meant to wall him off from matters involving Arnold & Porter’s business. But it’s not clear how rigorously the ethics agreements were actually enforced. His wife’s law firm refused to provide a list of clients — and the agency had no legal authority to require it, said Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the F.D.A. \nIn a review of thousands of pages of court documents and F.D.A. records and dozens of interviews with current and former agency staff members and advocates, The Times identified some clients and several instances in which the Shurens’ roles intersected. \nHer partner at the helm of the firm’s life sciences team began representing Theranos, the discredited blood testing company, in 2015, demanding that the F.D.A. halt an inspection at its sites in California. While Dr. Shuren said he was recused from the matter, court records suggested he remained involved. \nIn another case, Ms. Shuren’s firm was working on a \\$63 billion acquisition of the company Allergan in 2019 when Dr. Shuren initially declined to urge a recall of the company’s breast implants tied to a rare cancer. \nThe couple’s work overlapped again in 2022 when Dr. Shuren anContinued on Page A18 \n# \n# \n# \nPresident Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America’s deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal. \nThe shift comes as the Pentagon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade. \nThe White House never announced that Mr. Biden had approved the revised strategy, called the Nuclear Employment Guidance, which also newly seeks to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea. The document, updated every four years or so, is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of hard copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. \nBut in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change — in carefully constrained, single sentences — ahead of a more detailed, unclassified notification to Congress expected before Mr. Biden leaves office. \n“The president recently issued updated nuclear-weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries,” Vipin Narang, an M.I.T. nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month before returning to academia. “And in particular,” he added, the weapons guidance accounted for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal. \nn June, the National Security Continued on Page A6 \nAlyssa Leach and her husband have visited Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., every year since 2015. To them, the theme park feels like an oasis where they can escape the stress of everyday life. So when their son, Lincoln, was born in 2020, Ms. Leach wanted his first visit to the park to be special and spared no expense in planning it. She booked a twoweek trip to visit Florida in December 2022, which included stays at Disney World and Universal Studios. \nThe costs quickly accumulated. Ms. Leach and her family traveled from New Haven, Conn., and paid extra for admission to “Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party,” an after-hours event that cost about \\$200 per person. She also shelled out \\$100 for the theme park’s photo service so she could download photos of the family that photographers took during the visit. The vacation cost around \\$6,000, which included accommodations, tickets and a car rental, and which Ms. Leach charged to her Disney-branded credit card. \nMs. Leach is one of many parents who have taken on debt for a Disney family vacation. In June, LendingTree, a financial firm, published the results of a survey of over 2,000 people that found that 45 percent of parents with children under 18 who have gone to Disney went into debt for the trip. \nFor a family of four, the cost of a one-week trip to Disney can range from \\$6,463 to \\$15,559, not including flights or souvenirs, according to an analysis by NerdWallet, a personal finance site. Many families can’t afford the trip at all.

His mother recalled being horrified by anonymous mail that arrived at their home, including one message that said her gay son would be better off dead. \nAfter the teenager found his car window smashed in the school parking lot, he told officials at Mankato West High School that he intended to come out of the \n# \ncloset and sought their support to start a gay-straight alliance club. The principal made an unconventional decision in the choice of a faculty adviser for the club, which the high school had never had before in this relatively conservative city: Tim Walz, a geography teacher who was also a football coach. Mr. Walz readily agreed, and the choice came as a relief to Mr. Reitan. \n“It was important to have a person who was so well-liked on campus, a football coach who had served in the military,” said Mr. Reitan, now 42. “Having Tim Walz as the adviser of the gay-straight alliance made me feel safe coming to school.” \nThat early chapter from Mr. Walz’s teaching years helped shape his stances as a politician and reflects how much Mr. Walz’s partnership with his wife, Gwen, has shaped his work over many years. Heavily influenced by Ms. Walz, who was Mr. Reitan’s teacher and someone the student confided in, Mr. Walz went on to make gay rights a signature issue \nContinued on Page A14 \n\n# \n# \nMs. Harris turned up in a dingy campaign field office, wearing a puffy coat and boots. Near a tangle of power cords, someone had propped an “African Americans for Obama” poster against a wall. In the midst of that bleak Midwestern winter, Ms. Harris was there to knock on doors for Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois mounting a long-shot bid for the presidency. \nBut Ms. Harris’s early bet paid off, and Mr. Obama has never forgotten it. \nSupporting Mr. Obama was a political risk. Ms. Harris was one of the rare Californians holding elected office — and one of few in the Democratic Party writ large — to endorse him for the presidency. Most of the party’s institutional heft had been thrown behind Hillary Clinton, a senator from New York who had a powerful surrogate in her husband, former President Bill Clinton. \n“To be here is worth 1,000 Champagne bottles and firecrackers,” Ms. Harris told a reporter on New Year’s Day, surrounded by campaign detritus. “It’s equal to that, in terms of the thrill, the excitement and the promise for tomorrow.” \nCHICAGO — On New Year’s Eve in 2007, Kamala Harris, then the district attorney of San Francisco, prepared to spend the holiday more than a thousand miles away from her native California. She had flown to Iowa for the first time, touching down in Des Moines during one of the wettest winters on record. \nCarlos Magdalena, “the plant messiah,” with giant Amazon water lilies at Kew Gardens in London. \n# \n# \n# \nLONDON — In Australia, he went plant hunting by helicopter and waded in crocodile-infested waters to watch a water lily bloom. In Mauritius, he grabbed a plant specimen off the ledge of a cliff. Last month, while looking for lilies in a Colombian tributary of the piranha-packed Orinoco River, he jumped from plank to plank in the pitch dark at 4 a.m. \nto get to a floating pontoon. “It’s not that I am that daring,” said Carlos Magdalena, a research horticulturalist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London. “These situations just arise, and they are not like Superman extreme. Sometimes it’s more Peter Sellers than Indiana Jones.” \nMr. Magdalena’s main responsibility at Kew Gardens is tending tropical plants. But he is also known as “the plant messiah,” as anointed by a Spanish newspaper in 2010, for his work rescuing several plant species from the brink of extinction. That work has earned him enormous respect in the field of botany and made him somewhat of a celebrity in the horticulture world.
