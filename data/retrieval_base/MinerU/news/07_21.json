It was the first time Israel has publicly struck the group after months of escalating Houthi attacks. \nThe airstrikes targeted a power station as well as gas and oil depots in the area of the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, according to a Houthi spokesman and two regional officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \nIsrael said it had struck sites used for military purposes, although Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, said that Israel had attacked some “dual use” targets that have civilian and military functions. \nThe Ministry of Health in Houthi-controlled Sana, Yemen’s capital, said at least 80 people were wounded in the attack, most of them with severe burns, according to The Associated Press. \nAdmiral Hagari said the operation was “one of the farthest and longest ever conducted by the Israeli air force.” He called the port a major supply stop for Iran to funnel weapons to its Houthi allies in Yemen, who have fired more than 200 missiles and drones at Israel over the past several months. \nBut the Hodeidah port is also a crucial point for all goods, including desperately needed food and oil, to enter northwestern Yemen, much of which is controlled by the Houthis; at least two-thirds of the impoverished country’s population lives under the group’s rule. \nYahya Sarea, the Houthi spokesman, said that the strike on the port would not deter the militia from engaging in additional attacks against Israel. The group says it fires munitions at Israel as \nContinued on Page 8 \n# \nKHARKIV, Ukraine — After Russian forces took control of his village in 2022, Volodymyr Vakulenko, a well-known Ukrainian author, sensed he might soon be arrested. So he buried his new handwritten manuscript in his backyard, under a cherry tree. \nBest known in Ukraine for his cheerful and lyrical children’s books, Mr. Vakulenko was seething with anger at Moscow’s occupying forces. As his village lost cellphone service and news from the outside world dried up, he filled his new work with reflective, sometimes morose, descriptions of life under Russian control: \n# \npeople neglecting their flower beds, cooking on campfires as utilities failed, and even fraternizing with the Russians. \nSoon enough, Russian soldiers indeed arrested Mr. Vakulenko, and his body later turned up in a mass grave. \nSix months later, a fellow Ukrainian author, Viktoria Amelina, learned of the buried book, dug it up, wrote a foreword and sent it to a publisher. But she too was killed, in a missile strike on a pizza restaurant. In May, in a final blow, Russian missiles blew up the printing plant in Kharkiv that had published the work. That strike killed seven employees, wounded 22 others and destroyed about a third of Ukraine’s overall book-printing capacity. \n\nDespite the anguish that accompanied it, the book, “I Transform: A Diary of Occupation and Selected Poems,” ended up on shelves of Ukrainian bookstores and is on sale today. Rescued from the dirt, the book stands as a symbol of an enduring Ukrainian literary life even as Russian forces try to snuff it out. \nThe deaths of Mr. Vakulenko and Ms. Amelina, and the scene of Continued on Page 11 \n\nAsha’s Farm Sanctuary in Newfane, N.Y., was the center of a bitter fight over livestock and lifestyle. \n# \n# \nNEWFANE, N.Y. — One summer day, a cow and a steer walked away from their farm. The cow was black and was named Blackee. The steer was golden brown, with two stubby horns. He was named Hornee. \nNobody knows when the cows got out, or how. They crossed a field and a road and wandered \nThis type of thing sometimes happens in rural western New York, where pastures and farms stretch for miles. But Hornee and Blackee had crossed not into another farm but into an animal sanctuary whose owner saves livestock from slaughter and encourages visitors to become vegans. \n# \nThe next morning, Tracy Murphy, the sanctuary’s owner, found the cows in her yard. She herded them into a pen, she said, and immediately notified the local animal control agency. Six days later, an investigator with the agency came to check in on the cows. He interviewed people around the area and learned that a neighbor, Scott Gregson, was missing a heifer and a steer.

Trump’s campaign is preparing a major effort to attack Vice President Kamala Harris if President Biden steps aside as the Democratic nominee, including a wave of ads focusing on her record in her current office and in California, according to two people briefed on the matter. \nThe Trump team has already prepared opposition research books on Ms. Harris, and has similar dossiers on other Democrats who could become the nominee if Mr. Biden were to drop out of the race. \nBut the bulk of the preparations so far have been focused on Ms. Harris, including a recently concluded poll testing her vulnerabilities in a general election contest, according to the two people. The Trump team’s attention on Ms. Harris is based on its assumption that if Democrats were to bypass the first Black woman to serve as vice president, it would drive even deeper divisions in the party and risk alienating their base of Black voters. \nTrump allies have also begun examining the records of Democratic governors who are considered potential running mates for Ms. Harris. Advisers to the former president are paying especially close attention to Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania — the state the Trump campaign is most focused on winning to block the Democrats’ path to the White House. \nA Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment. \nBrian Fallon, a campaign spokesman for Ms. Harris, said in a statement: “After tanking the bipartisan border deal, Donald Trump has resorted to lying about the vice president’s record. As a former district attorney and attorney general, she has stood up to fraudsters and felons like Trump her entire career. Trump’s lies won’t stop her from continuing to prosecute the case against him on the biggest issues in this race.” Since Mr. Biden’s disastrous de\nStung by Obama’s Silence as Allies Make Their Unease Public \nThis article is by Peter Baker, Michael D. Shear and Katie Rogers. \nWASHINGTON — Sick with Covid and abandoned by allies, President Biden has been fuming at his Delaware beach house, increasingly resentful about what he sees as an orchestrated campaign to drive him out of the race and bitter toward some of those he once considered close, including his onetime running mate Barack Obama. \nMr. Biden has been around politics long enough to assume that the leaks appearing in the media in recent days are being coordinated to raise the pressure on him to step aside, according to people close to him. He considers Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, the main instigator, but is irritated at Mr. Obama as well, seeing him as a puppet master behind the scenes. \nThe friction between the sitting president and leaders of his party so close to an election is unlike anything seen in Washington in generations — especially because the Democrats now working to ease him out were some of the allies most critical to his success. It was Mr. Obama who elevated Mr. Biden from a presidential also-ran to the vice presidency, setting him up to win the White House in 2020, and it was Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, who pushed through his landmark legislative achievements. \nBut several people close to Mr. Biden, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal matters, described an under-the-weather president coughing and hacking over a hundred miles from the corridors of power as his presidency meets its most perilous moment. He has watched with rising exasperation as a succession of news stories appeared reporting that Mr. Schumer, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. \nContinued on Page 20 \nContinued on Page 17 \n# \nThis article is by Emily Cochrane, Steve Eder, William K.

He was polite but distant, a former co-worker said, ate lunch alone in the break room and rarely spoke with anyone. \nBut as western Pennsylvania geared up last week for the boisterous spectacle of hosting a rally for former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Crooks approached his bosses with a request, law enforcement officials said: He wanted to take Saturday off. He told them he had something important to do. \nIt was one of the few hints to emerge so far that the 20-year-old engineering sciences graduate was planning to become a political assassin. A week after Mr. Crooks opened fire at the rally and was killed by the Secret Service, his ideology and motives remain a vexing question for investigators and the people who crossed paths with him. \nERIC LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES Officials are seeking a motive in the Trump rally shooting. \n\nIn dozens of interviews, former classmates, teachers and neighbors said they still could not square their memories of Mr. Crooks — an awkward, intelligent teenager who liked to tinker with computers and spent his weekends playing video games — with the image of the stringy-haired gunman at the rally, armed with his father’s AR-15-style rifle as he \nContinued on Page 16 \n# \nKenya Serial Killings Case After at least 10 sacks with body parts were found in a dump opposite a police station, a suspect was said to have confessed to killing 42 women.
