If he had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Baldwin would have faced up to 18 months in prison. \n“There is no way for the court to right this wrong,” Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said in court as Mr. Baldwin wept. \nIt was a stunning end to the trial of Mr. Baldwin, who was rehearsing with a gun on the “Rust” film set in 2021 when it fired a live round, killing Halyna Hutchins, the movie’s cinematographer. Mr. Baldwin had been told the gun was “cold,” meaning it had no live ammunition. \nThe dismissal followed a dramatic scene when the lead prosecutor, Kari T. Morrissey, went from questioning witnesses to taking the stand herself. She gave an account of why a batch of ammunition that had been turned in to the state several months ago by a witness who claimed it was related to the “Rust” shooting had been put in an entirely different case file and was not handed over to the defense. \n“It was my impression that they did not match the live rounds from the set of ‘Rust,’” Ms. Morrissey said on the stand, saying that she had only viewed a photo of the ammunition. \nBut when the ammunition was brought into the courtroom earlier Friday at the judge’s request it beContinued on Page A19 \n# \n# \nRAMAT GAN, Israel — Idling away the hours in a darkened room in Gaza with two other hostages, Andrey Kozlov sometimes heard one of his captors on the other side of the door typing away on a laptop. \nThe man was a constant presence in the apartment, while other guards worked shifts and went out to the market, Mr. Kozlov said in an interview, from a hotel room in a Tel Aviv suburb a month after his rescue from captivity. \nClimate change is driving rates higher, but not always in areas with the greatest risk. \nSources: Keys and Mulder, National Bureau of Economic Research (2024); Zillow; FEMA; First Street Foundation. | Note: “Average premium as a share of home value” compares the median home insurance premium in 2023 to Zillow’s typical home value estimate in each county.

MIRA ROJANASAKUL/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \n# \nENID, Okla. — Surrounded by farms about 90 minutes north of Oklahoma City, Enid has an unwelcome distinction: Home insurance is more expensive, relative to home values, than almost anywhere else in the country. \nEnid is hardly the American community that is most vulnerable to damaging weather. Yet as a share of home prices, insurance costs more in parts of Enid than in New Orleans, much of which is below sea level. More than in Paradise, Calif., which was destroyed by the Camp fire in 2018. More \nWhen Rules Are Loose, Costs in Some Places Exceed Actual Risk than in the Florida Keys, which are frequently wracked by hurricanes. Even more than in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where houses have begun slipping into the rising sea. \n\nEnid’s plight reveals an odd distortion in America’s system of pricing home insurance. As a warming planet delivers increasingly damaging weather, the cost of home insurance has jumped drastically. But companies are charging some people, especially in the middle of the country and parts of the southeast, far more than other homeowners with similar levels of risk, an examination by The New York Times has shown. \n\nIndustry experts offer several reasons for the disparities, including the fact rural states have fewer homeowners to share risk, and states have varying rates of insurance fraud, which can drive up premiums. \nBut recent research points to iking pattern: Higher prem Continued on Page A12 \n# \nInsights Can Hinge on Imprecise Numbers \nPresident Biden’s re-election campaign is in jeopardy because of his poor debate performance. But lurking behind the Democrats’ anxiety is another factor: \n# \nNATE COHN \nThe average of polls has shown Donald J. Trump with an almost uninterrupted lea \nthe polls. \nfor 10 months, and this undoubtedly shapes the calculation of Democrats in Washington. It’s hard to believe there would be any serious drive to replace Mr. Biden if the polls showed him clearly leading, as they did throughout the last election. This puts a big responsibility on polls and pollsters. The fate of the president may not rest in their hands, but — at the very least — it will be influenced by their methods. \nAt the same time, it’s not obvious that polling is up to the challenge. \nPolls are inherently imprecise measurements, subject to countless sources of uncertainty. While they continue to be the best way — or only way — to measure public opinion in a big, diverse country, polls have been wrong before, and they will be wrong again. \nIn a sense, it is what polling is supposed to do in a democracy: give political actors insight into the will of the people, enabling decision makers to better respond to the demands of the electorate. \nAnd at this stage, Mr. Biden’s chances increasingly rely on the possibility that the polls are simply “wrong.” He could retake the lead in the polling before November, of course, but given the stability in the polls so far, it may be unrealistic to expect such a pronounced shift toward him. Mr. Biden himself appears to be counting on the polls being “wrong.” In his interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC last week, he questioned whether polling was “as accurate as it used to be.” \nIs he right? Will the polls be wrong again? The unsatisfying truth is that no one knows. \nIt’s extremely difficult to anticipate polling errors in advance. We won’t know whether this is a “good” or “bad” year for the polls until the final results in November. \nThat said, the polls are usually more right than wrong, even in their “bad” years. \nHere’s what we do know about the state of the polling — and the likelihood of a polling misfire — heading into what could be a \nContinued on Page A17 \n# \nDESPITE EDGE IN MONEY\nSoft Support for Biden Could Allow Trump to Expand Map \n# \nAs President Biden insists he will stay in the presidential race, Democrats are growing increasingly alarmed that his presence on the ticket is transforming the political map, turning light-blue states into contested battlegrounds. \nDown-ballot Democrats, local elected officials and party strategists say Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Virginia — all of which Mr. Biden won comfortably in 2020 — could be in play in November after his miserable debate performance last month. \nSome polls in these states suggest a tightening race between Mr. Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, with one showing a virtual tie in Virginia, which has not voted for a Republican for president since 2004, and another showing Mr. Trump squeaking ahead in New Hampshire, which has not voted Republican since 2000. \nOn Tuesday, the Cook Political Report, a prominent elections forecaster, downgraded New Hampshire and Minnesota from “likely” wins for Mr. Biden to only leaning in his direction. And in a meeting at the White House last week, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico told Mr. Biden that she feared he would lose her state, according to two people briefed on her comments. \nThe shakiness in the fringe battleground states is an alarming sign for Mr. Biden’s hopes in mustwin contests that were already expected to be close, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Their main jailer had a rounded face, so they called him “Muhammad H’dudim,” Hebrew slang for “Muhammad Chubby Cheeks.” \nMr. Kozlov, 27, a Russian Israeli, provided an exceptionally detailed account of his total of eight months in captivity, together with Almog Meir Jan, 22, and Shlomi Ziv, 41. \nHe described being held in six locations in the first two months, finally moving to the apartment in mid-December. In some places, he and the other hostages had only a pail for a toilet, and food was scarce. Mr. Kozlov said he lost about 20 pounds. \nThey were rescued from the apartment, a low-rise concrete Continued on Page A6 \n\n# \nAt home in Houston, above.
