The action takes place against the backdrop of a military threat from czarist Russia — something that has resonated with Ukrainians today as they absorb daily, and often discouraging, news about the battlefield and brace for missile strikes from modern Russia on their cities at night. \nIn a speech to the Israeli Parliament on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said the military had sought to protect noncombatants, by issuing evacuation orders, adding that about a million civilians had left Rafah ahead of, or during, the offensive. “Despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians,” he said, $^{66}\\mathrm{a}$ tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.” \nHe accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, and said: “For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas, it’s a strategy. That’s the whole difference.” As images of the dead and maimed reached screens around the world, the condemnation was instant. The latest opprobrium appeared likely to make it still harder for Israel to continue its campaign against Hamas in Rafah, the southern city to which about a mil\nThe smash hit isn’t a popular Broadway musical or a series of concerts by a pop star — it’s a play based on a classic 19th-century Ukrainian novel, “The Witch of Konotop,” and the mood is anything but upbeat. Consider the opening line: “It is sad and gloomy.” \nThe deadly fire that tore through the encampment on Sunday after an airstrike came at a particularly delicate time for Israel, just days after the International Court of Justice appeared to order the country’s military to halt its offensive in Rafah and as diplomats were aiming to restart negotiations for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. \nJERUSALEM — With international condemnation mounting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Monday that the killing of dozens of people a day earlier at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah was “a tragic accident,” but gave no sign of curbing the Israeli offensive in the southern Gaza city. \nKYIV, Ukraine — The lines for the show snake down the block, with people waiting for up to seven hours to buy tickets at the theater in downtown Kyiv.

As it happens, there is a wave of new electric vehicles significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Europe. \n\nWASHINGTON — President Biden wants more of America’s cars and trucks to run on electricity, not gas.

But some models, like the discount BYD Seagull, could still cost less than some American rivals even after tariffs, which is one reason Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and some other Democrats have called on Mr. Biden to ban Chinese E.V. imports entirely. \nInstead, the president is taking steps to make Chinese electric vehicles prohibitively expensive, in large part to protect American automakers.
