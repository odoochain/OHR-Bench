It has the potential for removing from cultivation—-for at least 10 years—-as many as 40 to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland. \nThe basic design for the Conservation Reserve Program—and much of the interest in its enactment—-resulted from Soil Conservation Service data and staff work. I congratulate allthose involved. \nThe Reserve was established as a voluntary program to help farmers prevent or control serious soil erosion now occurring on more than a third of America's cropland. Unchecked, this soil erosion would reduce the Nation's long-term capability to produce food and fiber, as well as increase sediment and other off-farm costs. \nWhile reducing soil erosion, improving water quality, creating better habitat for fish and wildlife, and providing income support for farmers, the Reserve also wili help adjust the production of some agricultural commodities currently in surplus. Thus, U.S. farm commodity programs and soil and water conservation efforts will harmonize with eachother. \nThe \"sodbuster,\"“swampbuster,\"' and \"conservation compliance\" provisions of the Food Security Act disqualify farmers from receiving USDA farm program payments if they produce crops on certain lands and do not have a plan approved by the local conservation district. These are not attempts to dictate land use or interfere with private property rights. Rather, they are attempts to remove certain governmentincentives that lead topoor land use. \nThe Conservation Reserve and other conservation provisions will have a significant impact on the work of SCS and other U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies—the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS),Extension Service,Forest Service, and Farmers Home Administration---as well as State soil conservation and forestry agencies and local conservation districts. \nSCS will determine eligible soils under the Act and help plan and apply conservation treatment called for in Conservation Reserve contracts. Establishing plant cover will be a big part of that conservation treatment. \nThe Food Security Act states that the conservation provisions will be administered through the use of conservation plans approved by local conservation districts in consultation with ASC county committees. This local involvement will help make the program a success. \nAs we move into these fast-paced times, it's important to keep in mind some of the basic principles that have made SCS a great agency over the last half century. One key has been our relationship with conservation districts. \nNow, more than ever, it's vital that we work to maintain a capable and efficient field staff to help districts and their farmers and ranchers protect and improve natural resources. \nI believe that SCS is taking the first steps into the most exciting and productive era of its history."

These readings, augmentedbyotherdata,areused tomake monthlystreamflowforecastsduring the snowmeltseason. \nThe surveys give agoodsnapshot of snow conditions ata single point in time, but they are not frequent enough to detect rapid changes that can alter the water supply. \"Much can happen between readings,\"' said Beard. \"There may be an intense storm or an unexpected warming at low elevations that is missed by the monthly survey. Accurate forecastsrequire real-time information.\" \nTo fill this information gap, SCS in recent yearshasdeveloped a snowtelemetry system(SNOTEL)to provide daily data.This system usesmeteor-burstradiotelemetryto transmit data from remote mountain sensors. \nThe meteor-burst technology uses the electronsinmeteortrails50to75miles abovetheEarthtoreflectorreradiateradio signals.

This presents problems forState andlocal governments everywhere,butmoresoinarid andsemi-arid partsofthecountrywhereofficialsmust wranglewith howtostretchalready meager supplies of water. \nOnewaycommunitiesindryareascan conserve water is through xeriscaping—a new waytodesign and maintain the areas around houses and buildings.Takenfrom the Greek\"xeros\"meaning\"dry,”xeriscaping reduces energy costs as well as conserves water. It means using native grasses, shrubs, and trees instead of popular waterdemanding plants that are better suited to higher rainfall areas. \nThexeriscapeconcepthasbeenadopted inpartsofColorado,Texas,andCalifornia and could have wide-reaching application in the growing communities of semi-arid northern Nevada.A group of professionals in landscaping,engineering, and resource conservation and concerned laypeople have formed a Great Basin xeriscaping groupinReno,Nev.,toincreasecitizens awarenessof thetechniqueand demonstrate its use. \nThe group includes representatives of the NorthernNevadaNativePlant Society,the RenoParks&RecreationDepartment,the Nevada State Division of Forestry,the University of Nevada Department of Plant Science, the Washoe County Cooperative Extension Service, the Washoe-Storey Conservation District(CD),and the Soil ConservationService. \nRight now, the group's major effort is developinga 114-acre demonstration garden at the Sierra Pacific Power Company's new Sierra Plaza, afive-story office complex. The xeriscape garden will include turfgrass trial plots, models of landscaping alternativesforresidentiallots,andacollec tion of drought-tolerant plants. \nLeader of the Nevada xeriscaping group and a district supervisor of theWashoeStorey CD, Thomas A. Stille of Stille & AssociatesLandscapeArchitects&Planners in Reno, said that the dry landscape method involves good design, soil improvement, mulch, minimal turf, zoned irrigation, drought-tolerant plants,and regular maintenance. \nAccording to Stille,one of the principal xeriscape designcriteria isreducingthe need for water. Incorporating organic matter into the soil is one way to do it. The organic matter helps hold moisture in sandy soil and helps water to penetrate clayey soil. Using plants that perform better in poor, sandy soils or clayey soils also reduces the need for watering,said Stille. \nMulchesreduce evaporation,control weeds, and provide a cool root zone for plants. Organic mulches such as wood chipsorbarkeventuallybreak down,also adding organic matter to the soil. \nTurf is not only a heavywater user, but it is also expensive to maintain, said Stille. Although shrubs and ground cover require substantial labor thefirst year or two, after they are established they require far less water and care than turf. For small areas of turf in a xeriscape design, Stille suggests that homeowners consider tall fescues, buffalograss, blue grama, streambank wheatgrass, and some of the fine leaf fescues instead of the popular, but waterdemanding,Kentucky bluegrass. \nAutomatic irrigation systems should be zoned to irrigate different areas according to theirwaterrequirements,said Stille.A small turfareashouldbeonadifferentvalvethan ashrubbed,andanareaonthenorthside ofatwo-storybuildingshouldreceiveless waterthananexposedwest orsouthside. Drip irrigation systems are more efficient thansprinklersbecause of waterloss to wind and evaporation.

By using the space-age technology of photovoltaics,however,severalranchersarenow turning the sunshine into electricity and pumpingwaterwith it. \nOver the past year, the Trego County Soil Conservation District has helped toinstall four solar-powered pumping stations. These stations are in remote areas of the county where the costof installing conventional electric lineswouldbeprohibitive. \nThesystem being installed was developed by EddieBollig,alocal conservation contractor, with assistance from Bill Crawford, district conservationist for the Soil Conservation Service.Bollig and Crawford began the project by obtaining information from the manufacturers of solar panels. They studied the various solar panels and pumps on the market and chose a combinationthatwouldworkwherethewatertableis relatively shallow,within about 12 feet of the soilsurface.Thismakesthesystemsuitable forabouthalfofTregoCountyandagood deal of northwestern Kansas, which is on the edge of the Ogallala Aquifer. Springs in the aquifer are good sources of water for the system. \nTwo of thesolar units have been installed and are functioning extremely well in the 1,200-acre Triple Creek area northeast of WaKeeney. This is an area of dry grassland wherepit ponds havebeen used to water cattle. Years ago it was necessary to haul watertothecattle. \n\"This operation could replace pit ponds, or it could supplement them,' said Crawford. \"lt could be used in the winter when the ponds are frozen over\" \nThe solar panel is set up on a metal stand tokeepit frombeing disturbed bycattle.It is capable of delivering a 12-volt, 2-ampere current.

The solarpanel and pump cost from $\\$500$ to $\\$1,000$ ,aboutone-third thecost ofa newwindmill and conventional well. \n\"Windmills provide more power than you reallyneed，said MarvinLynd,oneofthe ranchers who has installed the system. \"You can't move a windmill.

Damage has been particularlybadinaresidential section along Elm Street,whereBig Hollow Creekand Butler Brook converge and flow west to the DelawareRiver. \nIn 1983,the village asked SCS to help control the flooding. Stream flooding of this type is usually controlled by building a floodcontrol dam or widening the existing channel.Becausethetwostreamscame together ina heavily populated part of the village, however, neither of these solutions wasfeasible. \n\nThe engineers went to their drawing boards. They were presented with complex engineering considerations that required a special design. They also knew they had to design a structure that was not very expensive and involved little or no building relocation. \nLocal residents were especially concerned about the visual impact of the project on their neighborhood. \"We had to worry about what we were going to have to live with,\" said Pete Hempstead, chairman of the Watershed Steering Committee. \nRerouting the stream to the river appeared tobethebestsolution.Thiscould be done by digging a narrow outlet channel through theresidentialareawhere the homes are close together. A special transition structure would be needed, however, to funnel floodwaterfromthewideearthen channelintothenarrow concreteoutlet channel. \nThe transition structure would have to keep thesurface of thefloodwateras low as possible in the outlet channel. To accomplish this,the engineers designed a concrete,fan-shaped structure with curved \nsides that provides a smooth,uniform change in bottom width, side slope, and elevation. \nBuilding the transition structure required 212 cubic yards of concrete and 20 tons of steel reinforcement. Because this structure is unique forthe site conditions,the contractor had to developnew construction methods. The inside and outside sidewall formswere anchored tothefloorof the structure. The surface was made smooth by forming the inside faces with plywood. \nThefinished transition structure is 60feet long and carrieswaterdown a 5.5-foot changeinelevation.Floodwater enters the transition structurefrom the 38-foot-wide trapezoidal earth channelat a speed of about 6 feet per second. It gradually accelerates and enters the 22-foot-wide rectangular concretechannel at about20feetper second. \nUpstream from the transition structure, two dikeswerebuilt along Big Hollow Creek and Butler Brook to protect adjacent properties, including a high school and offices of a power company. The dikes guide floodwater to a holding area, which between flood times is a grassy, landscaped depression. Fromthere,thefloodwaterflows through the transition structure and the outlet channel to theriver. \nAtransitionstructurewasbuiltto smoothlyfunnelfloodwaterintothe narrowconcreteoutletchannel. \nPhotos by Karen Rusinski, visual information specialist, SCS, Syracuse, N.Y. \nFencing and landscaping help integrate the outlet channelinto the Deposit, N.Y., neighborhood."

Deposit lies in two counties,BroomeandDelaware,andassistance wasprovided by the soil and water conservationdistrictinboth. \nThe channel and transitionstructurewere fenced, and the entire area was landscaped. According to Hempstead, village residents are pleased with the project.\"No buildings had tobe moved’he said,“and it looks good. Esthetically, it's symmetrical, functional, and integrated into the neighborhood by the landscaping design.

But now that uncontrolled drainage is beingblamedforanumberofwater-related problems,severalhundredfarmersare using water conservationpractices to develop a more controlled approach to watertablemanagement. \nMuch of thenewinterest incontrolled drainage began in 1983, when the Soil ConservationService establishedseven projectsineasternNorthCarolinatodemonstratehowwaterconservationpracticescan beappliedinpreexistingdrainagesystems to manage the water table.Otherfarmers in the area soon began adopting water conservation plans for crop fields where they previously practiced only drainage. \n\nTheswitchfromuncontrolled tocontrolleddrainageintheareahasrequired fundamental changes in the attitudes of the people involved. First, the land users, many of whom have spent their working lives trying to keep their drainage systems free and flowing,had to be shown that it can sometimes be in their interest to restrict drainage. Second,SCSpersonnel had tobetrained in how to best apply water conservation practicestoimprovewaterquality,reduce the use of ground water foririgation, reduce theinfluenceofagriculturalfreshwater runoff on primary saline nursery areas, and achievethegoalsofthelandusers. \nThedrainageof cropland and forestland has historically been one of the most important componentsof landmanagement in easternNorth Carolina.The need for drainage has been strongly reinforced by repeatedcropandforestlossesoverthe yearsasaresultofexcessivesoilwetness. As aresult, the land users have installed a vastsystemofdrainagecanals and ditches. \nOnsite, the uncontrolled drainage provided by this system has lowered the natural water table and reduced the ability of many soils to produce field crops and forest. Saltwater intrusion into farmland and forestland adjacent to estuaries and sounds has also become a common problem. Offsite,agricultural and silvicultural runoff is being blamed for the degradation of water quality in rivers, sounds, and primary saline nurseryareas. \nAnotherproblem concernsirrigation.The principal source of irrigation water in the area has alwaysbeenground waterdrawn from the lower, highly productive aquifers. Verylittleemphasishasbeenplacedonthe developmentofsurficialaquifersoronthe use of water-control structures in thenetworkofdrainagecanalstoconservesurface waterrunoff asasourceof irrigationwater. This has contributed to demands being placedonthegroundwaterresourcesthat, if allowed to continue,couldresult in direct competitionbetween the agriculturaland urban-industrialcommunitiesforthese limitedwaterresources. \nRecent research has shown that many of thesewater-relatedproblemscanbe addressedbywaterconservationpractices. For example, conservation practices can reducesomeofthefreshwaterrunoff blamed for the degradation of primary saline nursery areas. Water-control structuresinmajorditches andcanalscan control thequality andquantityofwater entering these areas during critical periods. They can also be used toincrease the amountoffreshwateravailable,andsome researchsuggeststheycanbeused to increasetherateofrechargetoaquifers. Water historically drained from a watershed can be conserved and stored in a surficial aquifer for use as irrigation water. \nIn additiontotheresearchvalidating the use of water conservation practices, a computer model hasbeen developed at North Carolina State University for designing total water management systemsforindividual fields.The model,\"DRAINMOD,\"enables the designer to observe the performance of thewatertableinthefield inrelationtothe weather, soil properties, tile or ditchspacings,surface drainage,and other conditions. \nThe land users in eastern North Carolina were aware of the water-related problems for which they were being blamed.

Grossman, Hari Eswaran, and Richard H.Rust \nThispublicationisdedicatedtothe memory of Dr.Guy D. Smith,a soil scientistwhopioneered the soil classificationsystem todayknown as the U.S. system of soil taxonomy. It contains papers presented at a symposium of the Soil Science SocietyofAmerica(SSSA)inthe fall of 1982. Thoughts are given on the history ofsoil taxonomy and its future,theroleofclassificationin research planning and technology transfer, and its impact on the national cooperative soil survey. \n\nSoil Taxonomy(SSSA Special Publication Number 14)is available for $\\$12$ fromSSSA Headquarters Office, Attn: Book Order Department, 677 South Segoe Road, Madison,Wis.53711. \n# \nby John A. Folk-Williams, Susan C. Fry, and Lucy Hilgendorf \nThis is the third and final volume in theWaterin theWestseries, published by the Western Network, a nonprofit organization that providesinformationaboutnatural resourceconflictsintheWestern States. \nUrban growth in seven Western States has resulted in strong competitionforcontrolofwater resourcesintheregion.While urbanresidents areconcerned about paying for water projects that affectruralareas,thosewithastake in rural resources—including farmers,Indiantribes,andenvironmentalists——worryabouttheenvironmentalandeconomicimpacts. Aconcernofbothurbanandrural groupsis their abilitytoaffect the decision-making process concerning the use of water. In an effort to beheard,someoftheseinterest groups have brought litigation against local and State governments;others have used negotiating methods for influencing decisionsaboutwater. \nThisbookoffers56real-lifecase studies of conflict overa waterissue involving a municipality. It outlines the development of the conflict, describesthe methods beingused to make decisions, and highlights theneedsofwaterusersinboth urbanand rural areas. \nWesternWaterFlowstotheCities is a useful tool for water managers, public officials, attorneys, and concernedcitizens-bothurbanand rural-whomustconfrontand understand thewaterissues and conflictsintheWest. \nThe book includes maps, a bibliography,a table ofcases cited in the study, and an index. \nCopies of the book are available for $\\$25$ (plus $\\$2.50$ shipping and handling) from Island Press, Order Department, Box 7, Covelo, Calif. 95428. \n# \nby James R.
