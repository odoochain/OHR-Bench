Vance of Ohio to be his running mate, wagering that the young senator will bring fresh energy to the Republican ticket and ensure that the movement Mr. Trump began nearly a decade ago can live on after him. \nMr. Vance, 39, is a political newcomer who entered the Senate only last year, but he has spent that time methodically ascending the conservative firmament. \nOnce an acerbic Trump critic — attacking Mr. Trump as “reprehensible” and calling him “cultural heroin” — he won Mr. Trump’s backing in his 2022 Senate race by wholly embracing his politics and his lies about a stolen election. The endorsement lifted him above a crowded field, and ultimately to the Senate. \nMr. Vance, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who became best known for writing the memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” did not forget it. He quickly emerged as a top defender of the former president in the halls of Congress and on television, taking his cues from Mr. Trump while frequently bucking the priorities of Senator Mitch McConnell, the chamber’s longtime Republican leader. \nMr. Trump’s selection came just days after he survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, an episode that underlined the significance of his choosing a running mate who might be in line as Mr. Trump’s successor. Mr. Vance, an ardent and vocal defender of Mr. Trump, went further than many of his allies, directly attributing the shooting to the rhetoric of President Biden and his campaign, even as Mr. Trump and his campaign called for unity. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination,” Mr. Vance wrote on X. \nMr. Trump announced his choice in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, on Monday as the Republican National Convention was getting underway in Milwaukee. He said that Mr. Vance was “the person best suited” to be his potential vice president. He highlighted Mr. Vance’s time in the Marine Corps and his memoir, saying he believed Mr. Vance was a champion for hardworking people, particularly the workers and farmers in a number of key swing states. \nIn Mr. Vance, Mr. Trump has tapped an ambitious ideologue who relishes the spotlight and has already shown he can energize donors on behalf of the presumptive nominee. His youth — there are nearly 40 years separating them, and Mr. Vance is the first millennial nominated to a major-party ticket — could prove a boon to the Continued on Page A14 \n\nHAIYUN JIANG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES J.D.

Trump’s presidency was a major turn away from the Republican Party’s long embrace of free-market economics. If the Republican platform is any indication, a second Trump term would be a near-complete abandonment. The 2024 platform, which was released last week and is expected to infuse the Republican National Convention that started in Milwaukee on Monday, promises action on what have become Mr. Trump’s signature issues: It pledges to pump up tariffs, en\n# \ncourage American manufacturing and deport immigrants at a scale that has never been seen before. What it lacks are policy ideas that have long been dear to economic conservatives. The platform does not directly mention fiscal deficits, and, apart from curbing government spending, it does not make any clear and detailed promises to rein in the nation’s borrowing. Other policies it proposes — including cutting taxes and expanding the military — would most likely swell the nation’s debt. \n\nThe Republican platform also does not mention exports or encouraging trade. And while the document insists that the party will lower inflation, long a pertinent issue for economic conservatives, it fails to lay out a realistic plan for doing that.

Trump on Saturday was — at least in hindsight — an obvious security risk. Its rooftop offered an ideal sniper’s perch, with a close, elevated and unobstructed view of Mr. Trump. \nBut when the Secret Service drew up plans for the rally, it left that building outside its security perimeter. Instead, local law enforcement officials in Butler, Pa., were given responsibility for the building, and no police officers were stationed on the roof itself. \nThe building, used as a warehouse by equipment manufacturer AGR International, has become a focal point of investigations into the shooting that nearly felled a former American president, one that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas on Monday called a security failure. \nThe first question is why the building, about 450 feet from the stage, was left out of the perimeter.

Four minutes after the first report of a shooting at a rally for Donald J. Trump on Saturday, an anonymous account on X posted, “Joe Biden’s antifa shot President Trump.” \nWithin half an hour, another account on X with links to the QAnon conspiracy theory claimed without proof that the attack against Mr. Trump had probably been ordered by the C.I.A. Shortly after that, the far-right activist Laura Loomer posted on X about some recent remarks that President Biden made about Mr. Trump and then wrote, “They tried to kill Trump.” She did not provide evidence. \nAn hour later, with official details of the assassination attempt still scant, the narrative that Mr. Biden and his allies had engineered the attack on Mr. Trump was being amplified by Republican lawmakers, Russian sympa\nContinued on Page A17 \n# \nSpecial Counsel’s Appointment Is Ruled Improper, and Appeal Is Planned \n# \nIn a stunning decision delivered on the first day of the Republican National Convention, the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, found that Mr. Smith’s appointment as special counsel was improper because it was not based on a specific federal statute and because he had not been named to the post by the president or confirmed by the Senate. \nShe also found that Mr. Smith had been improperly funded by the Treasury Department. \nThe federal judge overseeing former President Donald J. Trump’s classified documents case threw out all of the charges against him on Monday, ruling that Jack Smith, the special counsel who filed the indictment, had been given his job in violation of the Constitution. \nThe ruling by Judge Cannon, who was put on the bench by Mr. Trump in his final year in office, flew in the face of previous court decisions reaching back to the Watergate era that upheld the legality of the ways in which independent prosecutors have been put into their posts. \nThe classified documents case, which was being heard in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla., once appeared to be the most straightforward of the four criminal prosecutions that Mr. Trump has faced. He was charged last year with illegally holding on to classified national security materials after leaving office and then obstructing government efforts to retrieve them along with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos DeOliveira. \nIt handed Mr. Trump a major legal victory two days after he was wounded in a shooting at a campaign rally and at the very onset of the political pageant where he is set to formally become his party’s presidential nominee. \nThe charges against Mr. Nauta and Mr. DeOliveira were also tossed out. \nMr. Smith’s office said he intended to appeal. “The dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the attorney general is statutorily authorized to appoint a special counsel,” said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel. “The Justice Department has authorized the special counsel to appeal the court’s order.” \n\nIt has long been clear that the documents case would not go to trial before the election in November, largely because of the glacial pace with which Judge Cannon has handled it. Should Mr. Trump be elected president again, he could simply have his Justice Department dismiss the case if it is reinstated on appeal — and even if he does not, longstanding Justice Department policy forbids prosecuting a sitting president. \nBut even if the appeal succeeds, the case still might never go in front of a jury. \nBut Judge Cannon’s decision to dismiss the indictment in its entirety at such a consequential moment in Mr. Trump’s campaign was a remarkable development for the former president’s legal and political future, giving him more ammunition to portray the prosecution as an effort by President Biden and his allies to undercut him in the election. \nU.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT Boxes of documents stored in a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago. \n\nIn a statement on his social meContinued on Page A15 \nREBUFF Judge Aileen M.

On the surface, at least, that can help Japanese society run smoothly. \nDuring the pandemic, for example, the government never mandated masks or lockdowns, yet the majority of residents wore face coverings in public and refrained from going out to crowded venues. Japanese tend to stand quietly in lines, obey traffic signals and clean up after themselves during sports and other events because they have been trained from kindergarten to do so. \nCarrying the boxy, bulky backpack known as a randoseru to school is “not even a rule imposed by anyone but a rule that everyone is upholding together,” said Shoko Fukushima, associate professor of education administration at the Chiba Institute of Technology. \n\nOn the first day of school this spring — the Japanese school year starts in April — flocks of eager first graders and their parents arrived for an entrance ceremony at Kitasuna Elementary School in the Koto neighborhood of eastern Tokyo. \nSeeking to capture an iconic moment mirrored across generations of Japanese family photo albums, the children, almost all of \nNORIKO HAYASHI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The age-old bags, once uniform, now include distinctive details. \n# \nFighting to Curb Russian Gains Ukraine’s military is scrambling to regroup as Russian forces march on Urozhaine, a southern village taken back by Ukraine last summer.
