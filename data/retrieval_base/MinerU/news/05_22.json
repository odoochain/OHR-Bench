Most complete the course in their first year of high school. But top-achievers are sometimes allowed to enroll earlier, typically in eighth grade. \nOne of the luncheon hosts is the billionaire Kelcy Lee Warren, who, as executive chairman of Energy Transfer, has built a national network of pipelines, including those serving L.N.G. export facilities. His Dallas-based company, which exports oil and gas products to about 50 countries, tangled with the Biden administration last year when it refused to extend a permit for a proposed export terminal that had run into delays. An indefinite pause on new permits complicates plans by Energy Transfer to continue an international expansion. \nThat decision galvanized oil and gas companies against Mr. Biden, according to industry lobbyists, and will be an undercurrent at a fund-raising lunch set for Wednesday in Houston. The luncheon, organized by three oil executives, will benefit former President Donald J. Trump, who is running to unseat Mr. Biden and is expected to attend, according to several people who have seen the invitation. To the industry, Mr. Biden’s pause on new gas export permits “was a wake-up call,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which supports the fossil fuel industry. “He could be potentially icing billions of dollars in long-term L.N.G. contracts. That’s real. That’s tangible.” \nFrom suburbs in the Northeast to major cities on the West Coast, a surprising subject is prompting ballot measures, lawsuits and bitter fights among parents: algebra. \nThe private luncheon to benefit MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, comes about a month after Mr. Trump hosted energy executives over dinner at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida. He asked them to donate \\$1 billion to his campaign so that he could retake the White House and dismantle Mr. Biden’s climate regulations, \nMr. Biden had imposed restrictions on drilling as part of his ambitious climate agenda, but he also approved an enormous \\$8 billion oil project in Alaska. The United States had become the world’s leading exporter of natural gas, and no other country in history was pumping more crude. The industry was enjoying record profits. \nThen, in January, Mr. Biden paused new permits for export facilities for liquefied natural gas. \nThe dual pathways inspire some of the most fiery debates over equity and academic opportunity in American education. \nAnother host, Harold G. Hamm, the executive chairman and founder of Continental Resources, is one of the pioneers of the shale oil boom that turned the United States into the world’s largest crude exporter. Also expected to join is Vicki Hollub, the chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, one of the top U.S. oil producers. \nDo bias and inequality keep Black and Latino children off the \nContinued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nWith their arrival just days away, the 2,500 police officers will confront a better equipped, funded, trained and unified gang force than any mission previously deployed to the Caribbean nation, security experts say. \nThe questions are so fraught because algebra functions as a crucial crossroads in the education system. \nWestern diplomats and officials say the influence and capability of many Haitian gangs are evolving, making them ever more threatening to the Kenyan-led multinational police force soon deploying to Haiti as well as the fragile transitional council trying to set a path for elections. \nfast track?

Those who take it early can take calculus by 12th grade, giving them a potential edge when applying to elite universities and lifting them toward society’s most high-status and lucrative professions. \nOnce largely reliant on Haiti’s political and business elite for money, some gangs have found independent financial lifelines since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 and the collapse of the state that ensued. \nThey have a stranglehold on the country’s infrastructure, from police stations to seaports. They have chased hundreds of thousands of people from the capital. And they are suspected of having ties to the 2021 assassination of Haiti’s president. \n# \nAn armed gang member in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

That’s up from 12 states five years ago, and eight states in 2013. The result is that insurance companies are raising premiums by as much as 50 percent or more, cutting back on coverage or leaving entire states altogether.

Mr. Netanyahu’s emergency war cabinet was on the brink of falling apart. \nTwo key war cabinet members, Mr. Gallant and Benny Gantz, a former military chief, had publicly excoriated Mr. Netanyahu in recent days for failing to develop a plan for governing postwar Gaza. Mr. Gantz had even issued an ultimatum, saying his centrist party would quit the government if Mr. Netanyahu did not come up with a clear strategy by June 8. \nSECRET MISSION The Hamas attack halted a plan to transfer Guantánamo detainees.

Political rivals in Israel offered support. American officials, who had been critical of his plan to invade Rafah, roundly condemned the I.C.C. action. \nIsrael has also been facing significant pressure to end its offensive from the United States, its most important ally.
