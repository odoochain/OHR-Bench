I am a registered nurse currently employed in the Occupational Health Department at NHTP. My professional experience includes, Emergency Medicine, Family Practice and Occupational Health. I have experience with the immunization process because I have given thousands of immunizations, received many myself and have chosen to have my children immunized when doctors recommended it. The purpose of this article is to provide information and resources related to the use, purpose and importance of immunizations so the reader can make an informed decision. \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), “A lack of knowledge about vaccination (immunizations) is a key reason why some adults consciously choose not to get vaccinated themselves or to vaccinate their children.” ( 2014). \n\n# \nPlease see Vaccines, page 2 “Immunization is the process whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically by the administration of a vaccine (usually an injection or shot). Vaccines stimulate the body’s own immune system to protect the person against subsequent infection or disease.” (World Health Organization, 2014). \n\n# \n# \nIn January we had a 6.4 percent no show rate.  We need to keep trending downward by keeping the appointments we make, or by canceling in enough time for someone else to use the slot... To help patients obtain appointments, the Naval Hospital now shows the number of open appointment slots each day on the hospital Facebook site, check it out. On Facebook, search: Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms. To make an appointment call -- 760-830-2752 To cancel an appointment call -- 760-830-2369 \nVaccines can be made of live viruses, synthetic materials, or killed bacteria or viruses. The duration of immunity after one receives an immunization varies for each vaccine and person. (Miller-Keane Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, 2013) (CDC, 2014). \n# \n# \n\nRear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, Navy Medicine West, answers a question during Admiral’s call Feb. 26. “I wish my sailors at Balboa were this vocal,” the Admiral said of our NHTP audience. Rear Adm. Gillingham, an orthopedic surgeon, spoke extensively about “high reliability organizations and behavior,” recounting how everyone, regardless of rank, should speak out if they perceive a problem. The Admiral recounted an incident in Iraq where it was a challenge keeping patients stable during air transport. An HM3 suggested using modified body bags--which became the winning solution. The Admiral strongly endorses TeamSTEPPS, a process that fosters mutual respect and team accountability, providing a safety net for the team and patient through a process that instills cross monitoring accountability for all team members. The Admiral toured the entire hospital, stopping frequently to chat with staff and learn their concerns. \n# \nWant to learn more about all the benefits TRICARE offers or just get ready for the TRICARE Service Center closure March 31?

        "text": "# \n# \nThe goal of giving immunizations is to eliminate disease and save lives worldwide. “Immunization is a proven tool for controlling and eliminating life-threatening infectious diseases and is estimated to avert between 2 and 3 million deaths each year. It is one of the most cost-effective health investments” (World Health Organization, 2014). \nImmunization programs eliminated Polio in the United States in 1979 and Small Pox worldwide in 1980. (The History of Vaccines, 2014). \nWhat happens when immunizations are not given or refused? Individuals who are not vaccinated for diseases are at risk of getting and spreading diseases to others. Two current diseases that are an issue in California and a result of unimmunized or under-immunized populations are measles and whooping cough. “Measles has spread through clusters of unvaccinated children in California, even when population-level coverage seemed adequate. Imported measles cases have spread the disease among un-vaccinated persons, including infants too young to be vaccinated. (Buttenheim & Jones, 2012). \n“Fifteen cases of measles have been confirmed in California since January 2014.” (United Press International, 2014). \nWhooping cough is also on the rise in California. The California Department of Public Health has seen 2,372 cases in 2013 (132 of those were hospitalized, 85 of the cases were infants $<4$ months old--one of whom died at 2 months of age. People with whooping cough spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the bacteria that cause the disease. Many babies who get whooping cough are infected by parents, older siblings, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease. (California Department of Public Health, 2014). \nDo immunizations have adverse reactions? “Most vaccine adverse events are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. The fact is that a child (or adult) is far more likely to be seriously injured by one of the diseases they are getting vaccinated against than by any vaccine. While any serious injury or death caused by vaccines is too many, it is also clear that the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the slight risk, and that many, many more injuries and deaths would occur without vaccinations.” (CDC, 2014). \n\nWhere can you get accurate up-to-date information on immunizations? The Center for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov), The World Health Organization (www.who.int ), and the California Department of Public Health (www.cdph.ca.gov) are all user friendly non-profit web sites that provide evidencebased information on immunizations and the diseases they prevent. Your medical provider should also be able to give you a fact sheet for any immunization you are to receive called a “Vaccine Information Statements (VIS),” available on the CDC webpage (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hc p/vis/index.html). For vaccine and immunization information via phone, please call ((800) 232-4636 (800) CDC-INFO). \n# \nThe choice is yours. If you say yes to immunizations, make sure you ask your provider what immunization you are getting and why. If you are not sure if you want the immunization, research it on the referenced sites throughout this article. Read the “Vaccine Information Statements (VIS)” or share your concerns with your provider. He or she may be able to alleviate your concern. \nIf you say no to immunizations, remember diseases are out there, you can get them and/or give them to innocent people--usually babies.  “An un-vaccinated child or adult faces lifelong differences that could potentially put him or her at risk. Every time you call 911, ride in an ambulance, go to the doctor or visit the hospital emergency room, you must alert medical personnel of your child's (or your own) vaccination status so he or she receives distinctive treatment. Because un-vaccinated people can require treatment that is out of the ordinary, medical staff may be less familiar, and less experienced with the procedures required to appropriately treat you or your child. \n\nWomen who are pregnant but not vaccinated can be vulnerable to diseases that may complicate their pregnancy. A pregnant woman who contracts rubella in the first trimester may have a baby with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which can cause heart defects, developmental delays and deafness. \nPeople who choose not to vaccinate their children also put others at risk if their child isn’t vaccinated and becomes ill. Special groups of people cannot be vaccinated, including those with compromised immune systems (e.g., those with leukemia or other cancers). These people rely on the general public being vaccinated so their risk of exposure is reduced.” (Department of Health: Information for a Healthy New York, 2014). \n# \nJose Busto (right) is photobombed by NHTP Deputy Comptroller Harry Sherman at his retirement luncheon Jan 30. Busto has worked for NHTP since 1988 when it was still a Clinic in the building we call the Village Center. “When we came to this building, it was enormous,” Busto said. “I kept getting lost.” This is Busto’ second retirement at Twentynine Palms. In 1984 he retired from the USMC as a Gunnery Sergeant. Although he’ll still be working 1- hour per week, he looks forward to traveling and visiting his sons and grandchildren with his wife, Delores. \nPublished by Hi-Desert Publishing, a private firm in no way connected with the Department of Defense, the United States Marine Corps, United States Navy or Naval Hospital, Twentynine Palms under exclusive written contract with the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command.

        "text": "# \nMartha Hunt NHTP Preventive Medicine \nColorectal cancer (CRC) (cancer of the colon and rectum) is the second leading cancer killer in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for cancers affecting both men and women.  The CDC offers five reasons to get your cancer screening performed. \n1. The top reason is simple. This single 20-minute test can save your life. It helps to identify those at risk of developing cancer. Waiting until you develop signs or symptoms may be too late. \n2. Talk to your doctor about your concerns because there are a lot of ways of preparing for and doing the same procedure and they can tailor the procedure to each patient’s needs. \nWhat are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?  Approximately 90 percent of people with CRC are 50 years of age or older. Personal history of colon cancer is also a risk factor.  The risk of getting CRC is higher among people who have parents, siblings, or children who have had CRC. \nA high-fat diet can increase the risk of CRC. It’s important to include foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in a well-balanced diet. Talk to your doctor or nutritionist about the foods that work well for you. In addition to increasing the risk for developing many conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, being substantially overweight increases the risk of developing CRC. A sedentary lifestyle can contribute to increased CRC risk. Even moderate exercise may help lower the risk. \n3. You probably won’t remember it. Patients usually are given sedative medication that makes them feel relaxed and sleepy. Most people wake up afterwards asking when the procedure will start. \n4. Having a colonoscopy at the recommended time helps keep the odds in your favor. During the procedure, your doctor may discover and remove precancerous polyps, which can keep cancer from developing. If the test finds cancer, treatment can begin right away. The sooner cancer is caught, the better chance you have beating it. \nTobacco use increases the risk of colon polyps, colon cancer and rectal cancer. For more information on how to stop tobacco, talk to your primary care provider or call Health Promotions at (760) 830-2814. The formal tobacco cessation class is no longer mandatory in order to access the medications. \nThe Navel Hospital has a registered dietitian on staff to help you make better food choices. Call 830-2774 to schedule an appointment to see the Dietician. Diets that are high in red or processed meats increase your risk of colorectal cancer. \n5.  A colonoscopy doesn’t just affect you; it gives your family valuable information about their own risk of cancer. \nHow often you should be screened depends on the test and your risk for colon cancer. If you’re at average risk and choose colonoscopy, you should have the procedure every 10 years, starting at age 50. \nColonoscopy may be performed earlier and more often in people at increased risk, including those with a personal or family history of polyps or colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or a hereditary syndrome. \nFor help becoming more active, contact the West gym: 830- 6451; or East gym: 830-6640. If you are over 50, make sure your doctor clears you to join an exercise program. Other resources include the heated pool at the Yucca Valley Senior Center or local walking groups. An excellent resource is the Go4LifeTM program at www.nia.nih.gov/Go4Life. You can order exercise booklets and DVDs that will show you how to exercise safely. \n# \nIn an effort to raise awareness and encourage the engagement of patients, families, health care providers, and the public, Naval Hospital Twentytnine Palms announced its participation in the 2014 Patient Safety Awareness Week campaign, Navigate Your Health Safely. \nPatient Safety Awareness Week, March 2-8, is an annual education and awareness campaign for health-care safety led by the National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF). Each year health-care organizations around the world take part creating awareness in their community and among their staff. \nThis year’s theme, Navigate Your Health Safely highlights the need for health-care providers to ensure that patients and consumers are more engaged in the health care process, whether for a routine exam or entering the hospital for surgery. \n“Health care today is extremely complex,” says NPSF President Tejal K. Gandhi, MD, MPH, CPPS. “All of us will be patients at some point in life, and we should approach that experience the way we would approach any important journey--with careful planning and communication. Navigate Your Health Safely reminds us that providing safe patient care can best be achieved when patients are a key part of the team and take an active role in their care.” \nThis year’s campaign is also stressing greater awareness of diagnostic errors, an area that has not been widely studied in the medical literature.  A diagnostic error can be defined as a wrong, delayed, or missed diagnosis. While not all diagnostic errors result in patient harm, they represent the leading cause of malpractice cases for many organizations. \nNaval Hospital Twentynine Palms will engage staff, patients, and the community through educational and awareness-building activities specific to patient safety science and practice. \nFor additional information on Patient Safety Awareness Week, please visit www.npsf.org. \nThe National Patient Safety Foundation has been pursuing one mission since its founding in 1997: To improve the safety of care provided to patients. As a central voice for patient safety, NPSF is committed to a collaborative, inclusive, multistakeholder approach in all that it does. NPSF is an independent, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization. \nHAND WASHING IS YOUR FIRST DEFENSE!"
