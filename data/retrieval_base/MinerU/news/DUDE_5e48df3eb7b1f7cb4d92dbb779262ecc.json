In the absence of streams to float logs to the mill,loggers had to haul incredibly heavy loads out of the mountains by rail-on steep grades, sharp curves and hastily laid roadbeds where power rather than speed was important. Lumbermen instantly recognized the Shays as the answer to their problems and bought them by the hundreds. \nU NLIKE standard steam engines, every whee of the Shay engine and tender is a drive wheelno wheel can spin unless they all spin-giving the Shays tremendous traction.Vertical cylinders and the crankshaft make multiple power strokes per revolution of the gear driven wheels for a smooth,even fow of power to negotiate steep gradeswith heavy loads effortlessly. \n$\\mathbf{O_{F}}$ THE 2.761 Shays built by the Lima (Ohio) Locomotive Works beginning in 1880, the four at Cass are among the few remaining anywhere, as priceless and almost unique relics of those old lumbering days. \nRare Heisler locomotive is now in use. \n\n# \nCASS WEST VIRGINIA POCAHONTAS COUNTY \n1968"
