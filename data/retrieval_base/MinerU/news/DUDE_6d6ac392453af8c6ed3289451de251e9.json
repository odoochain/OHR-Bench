(NNS) -- Thirty Hampton Roads-based Sailors took part in the Department of the Navy’s (DON) command fitness leader (CFL) training, Nov. 15-19 at Joint Expeditionary Base (JEB) Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, Virginia. \nThe five-day training gave participants an opportunity to experience firsthand the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS) -- the Navy’s proven, evidence-based methodology to get and keep Sailors in top physical condition. \n“The Navy Fitness Program has come a long way since I joined seven years ago,” said Petty Officer 2nd Class Krystal Pierce, CFL for the “Golden Warriors” of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 87. “Attending CFL School this week at JEB Little Creek was a real eye-opener to the changes the Navy is incorporating for optimum fitness and nutrition. I am excited to be able to deliver all I’ve learned to my command, and to incorporate these programs into my daily life. The fitness team at JEB Little Creek provides a fantastic program.” \n\n\n\nAccording to Susan Lowry, fitness director at JEB Little Creek-Fort Story and coordinator for the latest Norfolk area, fleet-based CFL training, participants are always made to feel part of the group during the training regardless of what level they’re working at. \n“The CFLs are the heart and soul of an exercise program at a command, but they don’t always have the background,” said Lowry. “We’re excited about the diversity of resources such as the NOFFS program we can bring to their commands. We have to have healthy Sailors. The CFLs and assistant CFLs will be able to utilize all the resources from NOFFS for any environment, even confined spaces.” \n\nCommander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) plays a vital role in delivering the CFL curriculum and providing NOFFS training to CFLs Navywide. \n“The Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System is in strong demand,” said Tunde Ridley, manager of CNIC Navy Fitness Programs. “Over the past 5 years, we have certified over 280 MWR (Morale, Welfare, and Recreation) instructors that are consistently taking NOFFS to the deckplate by teaching local NOFFS training courses at local installations.”"
