Turnout was high at about 67 percent, compared with 47.5 percent in the first round of the last parliamentary election, in 2022, reflecting the importance accorded by voters to the snap election. To many it seemed that no less than the future of France was on the line with a far-right party long considered unelectable to high office because of its extreme views surging. \n\nThe two-round election will be completed with a runoff on July 7 between the leading parties in each constituency. \nThe result of voting Sunday Continued on Page A9 \n# \nWhat does artificial intelligence sound like?

She was agreeable and self-effacing; she sounded like she was game for anything. After Sky’s debut, Johansson expressed displeasure at the “eerily similar” sound, and said that she had previously declined OpenAI’s request that she voice the bot. The company protested that Sky was voiced by a “different professional actress,” but agreed to pause her voice in deference to Johansson.

A variety of scientific evidence has also found that the pandemic seems to have affected some young children’s early development. Boys were more affected than girls, studies have found. “I definitely think children born then have had developmental challenges compared to prior years,” said Dr. Jaime Peterson, a pediatrician at Oregon Health and Science University, whose research is on kindergarten readiness. “We asked them to wear masks, not see adults, not play with kids. We really severed those interactions, and you don’t get that time back for kids.” \n\nThe pandemic’s effect on older Continued on Page A12 \n# \nObscure Authority Is Quietly Used to Block Several Dozen Trials in Just a Year \n# \nBrianna Villafane was in Lower Manhattan protesting police violence in the summer of 2020, when officers charged into the crowd. One of them gripped her hair and yanked her to the ground. \n“I felt someone on top of me and it was hard to breathe,” she said. “I \nMs. Villafane received a letter from the oversight agency about its conclusions. “I was happy and I was relieved,” she recalled. The next step would be a disciplinary trial overseen by the New York Police Department, during which prosecutors from the oversight agency would present evidence and question the officer in a public forum. \nfelt like I was being crushed.” The New York City civilian oversight agency that examines allegations of police abuse investigated and concluded that the officer had engaged in such serious misconduct that it could constitute a crime. \nThen last fall, the police commissioner intervened. Exercising a little-known authority called “retention,” the commissioner, Edward Caban, ensured the case would never go to trial. \nHe decided that it “would be detrimental to the Police Department’s disciplinary process” to pursue administrative charges against the officer, Gerard Dowling, a letter the department sent to the oversight agency said. The force that the officer used against Ms. Villafane was “reasonable and necessary.” The commissioner ordered no discipline. Today, Officer Dowling is a deputy chief of the unit that handles protests throughout the city. \n\nHis case is one of dozens in which Commissioner Caban has used the powers of his office to intervene in disciplinary cases against officers who were found by the oversight agency to have committed misconduct. \nSince becoming commissioner last July, he has short-circuited cases involving officers accused of wantonly using chokeholds, deploying Tasers and beating protesters with batons. A number of episodes were so serious that the police oversight agency, known as the Civilian Complaint Review \nInstead, Mr. Caban reached his own conclusion in private. \nBoard, concluded the officers likely committed crimes. \n“What the Police Department is doing here is shutting down cases under the cloak of darkness,” said Florence L. Finkle, a former head of the C.C.R.B. and current vice president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. Avoiding disciplinary trials “means there’s no opportunity for transparency, no opportunity for the public to weigh in, because nobody knows what’s happening.” \nTo piece together Commissioner Caban’s actions, ProPublica obtained internal records of some cases and learned details of others using public records, lawsuits, social media accounts and other sources. \nRetention has been the commissioner’s chief method of intervention. He has prevented the cases of 54 officers from going to trial in his roughly one year in office — far more than any other commissioner, according to an analysis of C.C.R.B. data. His predecessor, \nAs is typical across the United States, New York’s police commissioner has the final say over officer discipline. Commissioners can and often do overrule civilian oversight boards. But Mr. Caban’s actions stand out for ending cases before the public disciplinary process plays out. \nIndeed, the department does not publish the commissioner’s decisions to retain cases, and the civilian oversight agency makes those details public only months after the fact. Civilians are not told that the Police Department ended their cases. \nContinued on Page A16 \n\nDAVE SANDERS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Edward Caban, the New York City police commissioner. \n# \nThis article is by Lisa Lerer, Shane Goldmacher and Katie Rogers. \nIn the wee hours of Friday morning, not long after President Biden had walked off the stage from a disastrous debate, his campaign chair, Jen O’Malley Dillon, acknowledged in a series of private calls with prominent supporters that the night had gone poorly but urged them not to overreact. \nLater on Friday, top White House aides worked the phones, with Mr. Biden’s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, calling the Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, to check in, according to a person familiar with the call. And by the afternoon, the Biden campaign had transformed its weekly all-staff call into a virtual pep talk to dispel any doubts creeping into the campaign offices in Wilmington, Del., and beyond. \n“Nothing fundamentally changed about this election last night,” said Quentin Fulks, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, according to a recording of the allstaff meeting. “We’re going to get punched. We’re going to punch back. We’re going to get up when \nThe 48 hours after the debate were a frenzied campaign within a campaign to save Mr. Biden’s suddenly teetering candidacy, a multiday damage-control effort to pressure and plead with anxious Democratic lawmakers, surrogates, activists and donors to stand by the president, the party’s presumptive nominee. \n# \nAfter a frenetic run of seven campaign events across four states since the debate, Mr. Biden himself is taking a pause for a preplanned family gathering at Camp David. He arrived late on Saturday and will be joined by his wife, Jill Biden, the first lady, as well as the Biden children and grandchildren, according to two people familiar with the scheduling. \nThe gathering, for a family photo shoot, was scheduled in the spring, according to those people. But the timing and circumstances of Mr. Biden being surrounded by the very family members who have been crucial in his past decisions to run for the presidency — or to sit out a race — have heightened the stakes and scrutiny surrounding the Camp David retreat. \nContinued on Page A13 \n\n# \nInjuries Can’t Sack Him Jim McMahon has been the football icon that fans themselves wanted to be.
