Blinken said that the United States had received no advance knowledge of the assassination plot. \nIn the hours after the killing, speculation immediately focused on the possibility that Israel had killed Mr. Haniyeh with a missile strike, possibly fired from a drone or a plane, similar to how Israel had launched a missile on a military base in Isfahan in April. \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — After a week of oversights and failures, the officers protecting former President Donald J. Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., still had one last chance to get it right. The chance lasted about 30 seconds. \nIt began when a local police officer peered over the roof of the AGR International warehouse near the rally grounds and found the suspicious man he and other officers were hunting. Ninety minutes of confusion about Thomas Crooks’s intentions and whereabouts had ended in an instant. \n“Long gun!” the officer broadcast over the local law enforcement radio system, according to congressional testimony from the Secret Service this week. \nIt was urgent news that should have instantly traveled to a command center shared by the local police and the Secret Service, and then to agents close enough to throw their bodies in front of Mr. Trump. They still had time to disrupt an assassination attempt. \nBut the radio message never got to the Secret Service, and 30 seconds later Mr. Crooks unleashed his first shots. \nThat dropped communication was one of several instances where technologies that might have protected Mr. Trump from getting shot on July 13 did not — either because they malfunctioned, were improperly deployed or the Secret Service decided not to use them in the first place. \nThe Secret Service, for instance, turned down offers to use Continued on Page A17 \n# \nWhen former President Donald J. Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity on Wednesday, he lifted a longstanding and false line of attack from the fringes of political discourse to the very center of a presidential campaign. \nFor years, rivals and critics have lodged accusations that Ms. Harris shifts her personal identity to her political advantage, and that she is, in fact, not who she claims to be. Those attacks, based on falsehoods, misinformation and conspiratorial notions, have increased dramatically in the week and a half since she emerged as Democrats’ all-but-certain standard-bearer. \nJust hours after President Biden announced that he would not seek a second term, the rightwing agitator Laura Loomer posted on the social media site X that Ms. Harris “pretends to be black” as part of what she called a “delusional, Democrat DEI quota.” \nThe next day, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who spoke at the Republican National Convention last month, said on his popular interview show that the vice president was “sort of Black, sort of Indian.” The rapper Lil Pump, a Trump supporter who has some 20 million followers across Instagram, TikTok and X, said on Sunday that “Kamala Harris isn’t even black . . . she’s Indian.” \nTheir comments, seemingly aimed at suggesting to Black voters that the Democratic candidate Continued on Page A15 \nPresident Biden with relatives of the three released Americans on Thursday at the White House. “Their brutal ordeal is over,” he \n# \n# \nBERLIN — A prisoner swap on Thursday among seven countries freed the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and two other Americans held in Russia, along with several jailed Russian dissidents, in a deal whose size and complexity has no parallel in the post-Soviet era. \nThe trade freed 15 people imprisoned by Russia and one by its ally Belarus, in return for eight held in Western countries, including a convicted assassin and several held as Russian spies. \nIt was all the more remarkable for taking place two and a half years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin has cast as a war for Russian survival against the United States and its \nFrom left, the Americans Evan Gershkovich, a reporter; Paul Whelan, a Marine veteran; and Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor. \nllies who are arming and financ- lessly repressed democracy ad ing Kyiv. cates, journalists and war critics. \nThe deal, culminating a long and elaborate web of negotiations behind the scenes, delivered a diplomatic victory for President Biden, who has long pledged to bring home imprisoned Americans and to support Russia’s ruth\n“Their brutal ordeal is over, and they’re free,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, speaking of the freed Americans, whose relatives flanked him. “Moments ago, their families and I were able to speak to them on the phone from the \nOval Office,” he said, and he wished them “welcome almost home.” \nThe exchange took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, and involved seven planes ferrying the 24 prisoners from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia, according to the Turkish government, which has positioned itself as a mediator between Moscow and the United States throughout the war in Ukraine. \nIt was a triumph of a different sort for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has long highlighted his loyalty to Russian agents captured abroad. In nearly a quarter-century in power, he has leveraged the Russian law enforcement and court systems for political advantage, using them as \nContinued on Page A10 \nDANIEL BEREHULAK/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nThree years after withdrawing in Tokyo, Simone Biles earned the Olympic all-around gold medal, making her the third woman to do so twice.
