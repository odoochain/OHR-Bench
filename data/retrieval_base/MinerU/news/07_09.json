It voted a resurgent left into a first place that fell far short of giving the left power, and it shifted the political heart of the country from an all-powerful presidency to Parliament. [Page A7.] \nWith the Paris Olympics set to open in less than three weeks, and an August exodus to the beaches or mountains a sacred feature of French life, talks to form a government may stretch into the fall, when France will need a government to pass a budget. The election, which might have provoked an uprising, produced an impasse. \nThe New Popular Front, a resurgent if fractious left-wing alliance, came in first with about 180 seats in the National Assembly and immediately demanded that President Emmanuel Macron ask it to form a government, saying it would put forward its choice of prime minister in the next week. \nThis demand ignored several Continued on Page A7 \n# \n# \nODESA, Ukraine — Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital was destroyed by a Russian missile on Monday, shaking Kyiv, the capital, with images of bloodied and injured children, and sending hundreds racing to the scene to help clear twisted metal and smashed concrete in a desperate search for survivors. \nThe hospital strike was part of a barrage of bombings by Moscow across the country, including one of its deadliest assaults on Kyiv since the first months of the war. At least 38 people were killed across the country, including 27 in Kyiv. More than 100 people were \n# \ninjured. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 30 out of the 38 missiles launched by Russia during the attack, which began in the midmorning. \n“The attack was massive, combined with the use of aerial, ballistic and cruise missiles,” said Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv military administration. “The missiles flew at the capital in waves and from different directions.” At the hospital, one doctor and another adult were killed and at least 10 more people were injured, including seven children, local officials said. At least three children were pulled from the rubble, Ukraine’s emergency services agency said. \n\nOlha Melnyk, the mother of a child being treated in the oncology unit of the hospital — who was not there at the time — said she was in a state of shock. \n“There were so many families like us, who had their own personal war with oncology already,” she said. “And you know, these children can’t go to the basement, because all the tubes and treatments. If they do this, there will be no healing at all.

The platform is even more nationalistic, more protectionist and less socially conservative than the 2016 Republican platform that was duplicated in the 2020 election. \nDonald J. Trump told officials on Monday that he supports a new Republican Party platform, one that reflects his new position on abortion rights and slims down policy specifics across all areas of government. \nThe rest of the document reflects Mr. Trump’s priorities as outlined on his campaign website: a hard-line immigration policy, including mass deportations; a protectionist trade policy with new tariffs on most imports; and sections on using federal power to remove policies in academia, the military and throughout the U.S. government put in place by what it describes as radical Democrats. Mr. Trump and his top aides have alienated some activists by shutting them out of the development of the platform. The former president was especially focused on softening the language on abortion, the issue he views as his biggest vulnerability in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. \nMr. Trump, who has had the draft for several days, called into a meeting of party officials on Monday and said that he supports it. The document overwhelmingly was approved during a vote by the platform committee on Monday, passing 84 to 18, according to a person briefed on the matter. \nThe abortion section has been softened. There is no longer a reference to “traditional marriage” as between “one man and one woman.” And there is no longer an emphasis on reducing the national debt, only a brief line about “slashing wasteful government spending.” \nFiery Reply to Doubters: ‘Challenge Me at the \nConvention’ \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday dared his critics to “challenge me at the convention” if they want him out of the presidential race, refusing to step aside in a defiant letter to Democratic members of Congress and in fiery remarks on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. \nDeclaring himself “frustrated by the elites” who have called for his exit from the race, Mr. Biden engaged in an offensive blitz aimed at saving his candidacy. But it also did little to mollify restless Democratic lawmakers and laid bare the fractures in his party over whether his position as its standard-bearer would help or hurt its fortunes this fall. \nIn effect, Mr. Biden decided to engage in a no-holds-barred fight with his allies for the world to see. He was at turns defiant, furious, indignant, exasperated and dismissive. He insisted that he would not withdraw from the race but accused those who have suggested he step aside of being routinely wrong about politics. \nThe president used the friendly venue of the morning news show — hosted by Joe Scarborough, a longtime supporter who recently has been critical — to respond to demands that he demonstrate the kind of vigor that was missing from his listless and at times incoherent debate performance on June 27. \nMr. Biden raised his voice repeatedly during the brief phone interview, including after Mika Brzezinski, the co-host of the show and Mr. Scarborough’s wife, asked him whether he had undergone neurological exams after the debate. Sounding exasperated and angry, Mr. Biden rejected assertions that his stamina and mental abilities have not been tested in a real way. \nA Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment. \nThe section on protecting human life has been significantly watered down in the 2024 draft platform. In the 2016 and 2020 platforms, that section included extensive specific details about \n“It drives me nuts, people talking about this,” he said. In the days after the debate with former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden tried to be conciliatory. He admitted that he had “a bad night” and tried to explain that his performance was the result of a cold and jet lag. \nContinued on Page A14 \nContinued on Page A15 \n# \n# \nThe bags were leaky, they said, and risked making a greasy mess.

It was another chapter in the packaging wars. \nThere is broad agreement that the world needs to use less plastic. Plastic waste is filling the world’s landfills and clogging rivers and streams. Recycling hasn’t kept up; less than 10 percent of plastic waste gets recycled. Plastic can also contain chemicals linked to cancer and other health problems. \nWhen Costco tried to cut down on its plastics use earlier this year, putting its popular rotisserie chicken in a thin bag instead of a bulkier clam shell, some chicken lovers were displeased. \nReining in plastic packaging — often used only once, then thrown away — is an obvious first step. But putting that into practice has been tricky for businesses, policy\n\nSMITH COLLECTION/GADO/GETTY IMAG Costco puts chickens in bags instead of bulky containers. \nmakers and shoppers.
