For now, both Israel and Continued on Page A8 \nJERUSALEM — After weeks of foreboding, an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah has been averted, at least for now, as both sides returned on Monday to more contained confrontations along the IsraelLebanon border. \nIn negotiations for a truce in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu is pushing for a temporary break in hostilities that will theoretically allow Israel to continue to fight Hamas after a few weeks, thus placating his supporters who oppose ending the war before Hamas is completely destroyed. By contrast, Mr. Sinwar wants a permanent cease-fire that, even if it collapses in a few months, will give Hamas a greater chance of rebuilding its arsenal and retaining power in Gaza. \nSAN ANTONIO — A Latino civil rights group is asking the Department of Justice to open an investigation into a series of raids conducted on Latino voting activists and political operatives as part of a sprawling voter fraud inquiry by the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton. \nThe League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the nation’s oldest Latino civil rights organizations, said that many of those targeted were Democratic leaders and election volunteers, and that some were residents in their 70s and 80s. Gabriel Rosales, the director of the group’s Texas chapter, said officers conducting the raids took cellphones, computers and documents. He called the raids “alarming” and said they \n\n# \nWars With Neighbors Have No End in Sight \n# \n# \n# \nDuring the first three months of this year, 48 percent of bus riders did not pay, according to the latest available statistics from the transit authority, while 14 percent of subway riders evaded fares. Roughly twice the number of people ride the city’s subways as ride Continued on Page A15 \nEvery weekday in New York City, close to one million bus riders — roughly one out of every two passengers — board without paying. The skipped fares are a crucial and growing loss of revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is under severe financial pressure. \nYet public officials have done relatively little to collect the lost revenue from bus riders. Instead, they have focused almost exclusively on the subway system, where waves of police officers and private security guards have been deployed to enforce payment, even as fare evasion rates on trains are dwarfed by those on buses. \nNew York’s long-running fare evasion problem, among the worst of any major city in the world, has intensified recently; before the pandemic, only about one in five bus riders skipped the fare. \n“You don’t go after our grandmothers,” Domingo Garcia, a LULAC leader, told reporters. The raids were carried out in counties near San Antonio and in South Texas. In a statement last week, Mr. Paxton, a Republican, said they were part of an “ongoing election integrity investigation” Continued on Page A15 \nAt a news conference on Monday outside the attorney general’s offices in San Antonio, members of the group, known as LULAC, said they were filing a civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Along with the capital, attacks hit the west and the southeast. \n\n# \n# \n# \n\nMore than a decade ago, when Russia pushed Pavel Durov to shut down the pages of opposition politicians on a Facebook-like site he had created, the tech entrepreneur responded online by posting a cheeky picture of a hoodie-wearing dog with its tongue out. “Official response to the intelligence services to the request to block groups,” he wrote unapologetically. \nSo he focused on increasing the rhythm of each pull: legs, body, arms. Arms, body, legs. When the buzzer sounded, he had passed everyone to win gold. “I do it to show my kids that everything and anything is possible,” said Sergeant Morera, who lost his left arm in a 2013 convoy accident in Afghanistan. \nORLANDO, Fla. — Master Sgt. Ivan Morera isn’t used to being in last place. He’s a Green Beret. A relentless competitor. But at the 2024 Warrior Games, with his prosthetic hand hooked into a rowing machine, he was trailing the pack. \nHundreds of wounded or disabled troops competed alongside him at the U.S. military’s Warrior Games in Orlando, Fla., this sum\n# \nCrystal Fletcher, competing for the Marines team in this summer’s Warrior Games in Orlando, Fla. \n# \n# \nSince the annual competition was created in 2010, the Games have given the Defense Department a new way to support and rehabilitate a select group of wounded troops, helping them remain in the service and on duty. The event has also become an important symbol of the changing perceptions about who is fit to serve. \nThirteen years later, Mr. Durov’s anti-establishment streak appears to have gotten him into a fresh round of trouble with the authorities. On Saturday, he was arrested in France as part of an investigation into criminal activity on Telegram, the online communications tool he founded in 2013, which had grown into a global platform defined by its hands-off approach to policing how users behaved. \nFacing a significant personnel crisis as they struggle to recruit and retain service members — a mer, in events including archery, swimming, seated volleyball and wheelchair rugby. \n\nOn Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France referred to \nA Symbol of Changing Perceptions of Who Is Fit to Serve \nThe Warrior Games were designed to give some of those wounded service members a chance to be part of a team and work toward common goals, said David Paschal, assistant deputy chief of staff with the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, which oversees the branch’s recruiting efforts. “I think those two things are critical to supporting the recovery of our athletes.” The competition has also become a prime source of athletes Continued on Page A14 \nMr. Durov’s arrest and said that the country was “deeply committed to freedom of expression” but that “in a state governed by the rule of law, freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life.” Mr. Durov’s arrest has caused a firestorm, turning him into a folk deficit on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War — some branches have begun to let more troops with disabilities remain on duty. Military recruiters are also accepting more people with asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other previously disqualifying conditions. \n\n# \n200 Missiles and Drones Called ‘One of the Largest’ Strikes \nhero among those concerned about free speech and government censorship, especially as scrutiny of online content has increased globally. Elon Musk, the owner of X, and Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence contractor who fled to Russia after disclosing classified information, were among those who raced to Mr. Durov’s defense. The hashtag #FreePavel spread on X as debate raged over the intersection between tech and freedom of speech. \nRussia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in attempts to damage the economy and compound civilian misery caused by the war. \nThe offensive into the Kursk region has shifted the dynamics of the war after months in which Kyiv’s forces were on the defensive in Ukraine’s east. The push has slowed in recent days, but Mr. Zelensky said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had advanced by one to three kilometers and taken control of two more settlements. It was not possible to verify the claim independently. \nThe drone and missile attacks on Monday, which began around dawn, targeted energy infrastructure in the capital, Kyiv, and in the regions of Lviv and Rivne in the west and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast, the authorities said. \nThe strikes occurred against the backdrop of Ukraine’s incursion into southern Russia — the first invasion on Russian soil since World War II. On Monday, Ukraine’s forces continued to try to advance in the region. \nKYIV, Ukraine — Moscow launched more than 200 missiles and drones across a wide swath of Ukraine on Monday, damaging energy facilities and sending residents of Kyiv into basements and subways to seek shelter. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the assault as “one of the largest strikes” of the 30-month war. \nENERGY GRID DAMAGED \nAt the same time, Russian troops have been attacking relentlessly along the front line inside Ukraine, closing in on a key city, Pokrovsk, and razing towns and villages with artillery barrages and glide bombs. \nOfficials said at least four people had been killed and more than 30 others wounded on Monday. An earlier estimate said that eight people had died. \nAir-raid sirens have become a grim routine for many in Ukraine, and on Monday people in Kyiv sought shelter in basements and in the city’s subway system, whose stations are deep underground. \nThe strikes appeared to be an escalation of a Russian campaign against Ukraine’s power grid and inflicted damage significant enough to cause blackouts in Kyiv and other cities. \n”Like most previous Russian strikes, this one is just as vile, targeting critical civilian infrastructure,” Mr. Zelensky said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “There is a lot of damage in the energy sector,” he said, adding that crews were repairing the damage. \n# \n# \nhe mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Continued on Page A11 \nContinued on Page A10 \n\n# \nIndia Needs Better Ports Building new terminals and expanding old ones may determine whether the country can be the next China.
