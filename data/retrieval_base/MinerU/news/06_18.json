That finding has been deployed by gun rights activists to notch legal victories with far-reaching consequences. \nHe has been cited in a landmark Supreme Court case that invalidated many restrictions on guns, \n# \nand in scores of lawsuits around the country to overturn limits on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and the carrying of firearms. His findings were also offered in another Supreme Court case this term, with a decision expected this month. \nDr. English seems at first glance to be an impartial researcher interested in data-driven insights. He has said his “scholarly arc” focuses on good public policy, and his lack of apparent ties to the gun lobby has lent credibility to his work. \nContinued on Page A20 \n# \nGOASO, Ghana — On a busy day at the Kwapong Health Centre in rural Ghana, Beatrice Nyamekye put contraceptive implants into the arms of a half-dozen women, and gave eight or nine more a three-month hormonal injection to prevent pregnancy. A few sought condoms or birth control pills, but most wanted something longer lasting. \n“They like the implants and injections best of all,” said Ms. Nyamekye, a community health nurse. “It frees them from worry, and it is private. They don’t have to even discuss it with a husband or a partner.” \nThe bustle at the Kwapong clinic is echoed all over Ghana, and across much of sub-Saharan \n# \nAfrica, where women have the world’s lowest rate of access to contraception: Just 26 percent of women of reproductive age in the region are using a modern contraceptive method — something other than the rhythm or withdrawal methods — according to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, which works on reproductive and maternal health. \nBut that is changing as more women have been able to get methods that give them a fast, affordable and discreet boost of re\nContinued on Page A8 \nPHOTOGRAPHS BY GABRIELA BHASKAR FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\nChina’s new appetite for the spiky fruit has made it one of the world’s priciest, changing life for Southeast Asian farmers.

Murthy, announced on Monday that he would push for a warning label on social media platforms advising parents that using the platforms might damage adolescents’ mental health. Warning labels — like those \n\nthat appear on tobacco and alcohol products — are one of the most powerful tools available to the nation’s top health official, but Dr. Murthy cannot unilaterally require them; the action requires approval by Congress. \nThe proposal builds on several years of escalating warnings from the surgeon general. In a May 2023 advisory, he recommended \n# \nthat parents immediately set limits on phone use and urged Congress to swiftly develop health and safety standards for technology platforms. \nHe also called on tech companies to make changes: to share internal data on the health impact of their products; to allow independent safety audits; and to restrict features like push notifications, autoplay and infinite scroll, which he says “prey on developing brains and contribute to excessive use.” \nContinued on Page A17 \n# \n# \nWar Creates an Outsize Share of Amputees \nSIGN OF ISRAELI SHIFT \nThis article is by Hiba Yazbek, Bilal Shbair, Cassandra Vinograd and Abu Bakr Bashir. \nBleeding and crying, Dr. Hani Bseso’s teenage niece Ahed called out for him as she slipped in and out of consciousness. \nA shell had ripped into their home, which had been surrounded by Israeli troops as fighting raged outside that December day. It was too dangerous to make the five-minute drive to Al-Shifa Hospital, where Dr. Bseso, 52, worked in orthopedics. \nSo he grabbed a kitchen knife, scissors and sewing string — then amputated Ahed’s leg on the kitchen table, where her mother had just made bread. \nWith Moderates Gone, Netanyahu Disbands War Cabinet \nThis article is by Patrick Kingsley, Adam Rasgon, Cassandra Vinograd and Michael Levenson. \nJERUSALEM — The Israeli military said on Monday that it had paused operations during daylight hours in parts of the southern Gaza Strip, as a new policy announced a day earlier appeared to take hold, along with cautious hopes that it would allow more food and other goods to reach desperate civilians. \n“She was badly hit,” he recalled. With “no tools, no anesthetic, nothing,” he explained, “I had to find a way to save her life.” \nThe crude surgery was captured in a video shared widely online, a grim emblem of the agonizing choices that have been repeated countless times in a war that has ravaged Gazans’ lives and limbs. Doctors say they have been stunned by the sheer number of amputations in Gaza, which put patients at risk of infection in a place where access to medical care and even clean water is limited. \nIsrael’s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 people in the enclave, according to Gazan health authorities. The numbers do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The war has also left an even larger number of people of wounded. Local health authorities say that number is more than 85,000 — and aid workers say that includes an outsize number of amputees. \nGaza’s health care system is illequipped to cope. Many of the territory’s hospitals have been knocked out of service completely while others scrape by with severe shortages of supplies like anesthesia and antibiotics. \nAid workers said they hoped that the daily pause in the Israeli offensive would make it less dangerous to deliver vital supplies to areas in central and southern Gaza from Kerem Shalom, a key border crossing between Israel and Gaza, removing one of many obstacles to their beleaguered operations. \nBut aid agencies warned that other restrictions on movement, as well as lawlessness in the territory, would still make it difficult to meet the dire needs of Gazans struggling to survive after eight months of war. \nWith stockpiles in southern \n\nAMIR COHEN/REUTERS An Israeli convoy inside Gaza, where some military operations paused during the day. \nSurgeons say the lack of supplies and the scale of the wounded have forced them to amputate limbs that elsewhere would have been salvageable. But it’s a loselose situation, they say, because amputations require close care and, frequently, further surgeries. \n“There’s no good options there,” said Dr. Ana Jeelani, an orthopedic surgeon in Liverpool, England, who spent two weeks at Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza in March. “Everything requires follow-up that we do, and there is none.” \nContinued on Page A11 \nRAFAH ATTACK A Times investigation shows civilian casualties were almost inevitable.

Food supplies in southern Gaza were “more stabilized a month ago, but we are really concerned now,” said Mr. Skau, who visited Gaza last week. \nThe shift in Israeli operations came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disbanded the war cabinet he had formed after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, an Israeli official said on Monday, high\nContinued on Page A11 \n# \n# \nWhen prosecutors indicted Rex Heuermann this month on two additional murders in the Gilgo Beach serial killings on Long Island, they also described a manual he kept as a “planning document.” \nProsecutors say Mr. Heuermann created the document to “methodically blueprint” the selection, killing and disposal of victims, according to a bail application filed with the indictment. \nWritten in capital letters, the manual is structured as a series of reminder lists under topics like PRE-PREP, which offers banal tips about the importance of checking weather reports and \nThe manual is the most informative piece of narrative evidence disclosed since prosecutors filed legal papers after Mr. Heuermann’s arrest detailing investigators’ 18-month pursuit. In prosecutors’ hands, a document they say the defendant created to avoid detection may instead become damning evidence against him, looking for surveillance cameras. The PREP section is more grim, with directives to set up a holding area and “stage” with equipment for apparent sexual torture. The BODY PREP list includes reminders on how to avoid leaving evidence. \n\nContinued on Page A23 \n\n# \nNever Tiring of Hitting Juan Soto of the Yankees, who smacked bottle caps as a youth, has evolved a strong mind for the craft.
