It shows that Muriel Bowser is the only candidate to beat Vince Gray.  Voters are ready to turn the page and elect Muriel as mayor. They know that she won’t leave a single resident behind as the city tackles the tough issues of education, affordable housing and jobs.” \nThe poll results are based on a survey among a representative sample of 502 likely Democratic primary voters conducted from January 6 to 9, 2014. The survey, which has a margin of error of $\\pm4.4$ percentage points, was conducted among landline and cell-phone respondents, with the sample based off a list of registered Democratic voters with participation in past primaries.  Poll results memorandum attached. \nThis document was produced in house"

        "text": "# \n# \nTO: Muriel Bowser for Mayor   \nFROM: Frederick S. Yang   \nDATE: January 16, 2014   \nRE: Muriel Bowser within Margin of Error of Beating Mayor Gray; She has Most Upside Potential \nOur recent survey among 502 likely Democratic Primary voters in Washington, DC, yields the following key findings: \n1. Mayor Gray paces the field in the primary trial heat, but his advantage over his closest challenger, Muriel Bowser, is well within the 4.4- percentage-point margin of error.   \n2. There is considerable evidence that Mayor Gray’s “upside” is limited, as just $18\\%$ of primary voters would prefer to reelect him.   \n3. Councilwoman Bowser has considerable upside potential; she draws nearly even with the mayor despite being the LEAST known of the major candidates, which indicates that she will grow her vote as her name ID increases in the campaign ahead. \nWhile Mayor Gray currently has the most support in the primary election, he has a very narrow advantage over Muriel Bowser, although the race remains very fluid and unsettled; in fact, “undecided” is the actual leader in the poll. \nThe candidates are tightly bunched in the initial trial heat."

        "text": "The mayor’s current vote $(20\\%)$ is very close to his reelect score, which is a good harbinger that his growth potential is extremely limited. \n# \n\nFurther evidence of Mayor Gray’s limited potential is that just $5\\%$ of “undecided” voters (who are the PLURALITY in the primary election) want to reelect him, and fully two-thirds prefer to elect someone else. \nFinally, our polling shows the opposite situation for Muriel Bowser; she is in a statistical dead heat with the mayor despite being the LEAST well-known of the major candidates: \n• Gray $25\\%$ neutral/don’t know name   \n• Evans $47\\%$   \n• Wells $53\\%$ Bowser 61% \nIn fact, Councilwoman Bowser has a NARROW advantage among those DC primary voters who are familiar with her, meaning that as she increases her name recognition in the weeks leading up to the April 1st election, she is VERY likely to increase her vote. \nIn summary, the polling shows that the vast majority of DC primary voters have decided they want to elect a NEW mayor, and that Muriel Bowser, who also has significant campaign resources available—reporting more than $\\$750k$ cash on hand at the last period—is the candidate who is bestpositioned to win the Democratic primary. \nThis memo is based on a survey among a representative sample of 502 likely Democratic primary voters conducted from January 6 to 9, 2014.
