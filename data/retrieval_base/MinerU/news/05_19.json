A key reservoir got so low that it is no longer used to supply water. Last year was Mexico's hottest and driest in at least 70 years.

It is one of several major cities facing severe water shortages, including Cape Town; Sao Paulo,Brazil; and Chennai, India. Many are the consequence of years of poor water management compounded by scarce rains. \n\nExperts were warning about dwindling water supplies almost two decades ago to little avail. If the capital's water network was already held together by a thread then, now “some parts of the system are falling apart,” said Manuel Perlo Cohen, an urban planning researcher who studies Mexico City's water system. \nAnd while Mexico City's problems are worsening,they are not new. Some neighborhoods have lacked adequate piped water for years, but today, communities that have never had shortages are suddenly facing them. \n\"Mexico is the biggest market in the vorld for bottled water,”' said Roberto Con Continued onPage12 \n# \nCommon Ground Over MistrustofFree Market \n# \nWASHINGTON - It may be   \nthe most discussed fact about   \nAmerican politics today: The   \ncountry is deeply polarized. The   \nRepublican Party has moved to the right by many NEWS measures, and the   \nANALYSIS Democratic Party has moved to the \nleft. Each party sees the other af an existential threat. One consequence of this polarization, politicians and pundits often say, is gridlock in Washington. \nBut in a country that is supposed to have a gridlocked federal government, the past four years are hard to explain. These years have been arguably the most productive period of Washington bipartisanship in decades \nDurg tle Loviu panuelmc, Democrats and Republicans in Congress came together to pass emergency responses.

After the bill's passage, far-right House Republicans tried to oust Speaker Mike Johnson because he did not block it — and House Democrats voted to save his job. There is no precedent for House members of one party to rescue a speaker from the other.

The prime minister is increasingly being squeezed — externally from Israel's closest ally, the United States, and from within his own war cabinet — to clarify a strategy for Gaza.

But Defense Department officials have acknowledged that the initiative reflects a major shift in military operations as space increasingly becomes a battleground. \nThe strategy differs fundamentally from previous military programs in space by expanding the range of offensive capabilities —- a \nNo longer will the United States simply rely on military satellites to communicate, navigate and track and target  terrestrial threats, tools that for decades have given the Pentagon a major advantage in conflicts. \nInstead, the Defense Department is looking to acquire a new generation of ground- and spacebased tools that will allow it to defend its satellite network from attack and, if necessary, to disrupt or disable enemy spacecraft in orbit, Pentagon officials have said in a series of interviews, speeches and recent statements. \nContinued on Page 13 \n\nhe Jungle homeless encampment in Ithaca, N.Y.“Just a very dark place,” said a former resident. \n# \n# \nIthaca call it by name, as if referring to a neighborhood or historic district.

Some cracked a smile or offered a slow nod when they earned tips from passers-by. \n\nPerhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed. But this is Pakistan, where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the country's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians?
