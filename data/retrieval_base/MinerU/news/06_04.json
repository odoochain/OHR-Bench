Her margin of victory was the largest in a Mexican presidential election in decades. \n# \n# \nROME — Nationalists are surging and expected to make big gains when voters from 27 nations cast ballots starting this week for the European Parliament. But the prospect of success is already raising the question among farright parties of how far is too far. That question has become pressing as popular hard-right parties, especially in Italy and France, try to make themselves more palatable to the mainstream, splitting those who have sanitized and gained acceptability from those who are still considered taboo. \nToday, the hard right is a movement marbled by fissures and shifting alliances. \nLast year, Marine Le Pen, the French nationalist, seemed to disparage Italy’s hard-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who since coming to power has tried to make herself a trustworthy partner for mainstream conservatives. \n“Meloni is not my twin sister,” she had told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, making it clear she considered herself more hard line. \nNow, Ms. Le Pen has offered to form an alliance in the European Parliament, though it is not clear if Ms. Meloni wants to allow her to ride her coattails, as Ms. Le Pen’s party is still scorned by many in the European center right. \nMs. Le Pen, for her part, has distanced herself from Alternative for Germany, or AfD, a far-right party that appears to have become too extreme even for its fellow travelers. \nIn May, Ms. Le Pen and her group in the European Parliament, none of them shy about naContinued on Page A7 \n# \n# \nATLANTA — At a Holocaust museum in Atlanta, staff members had typically ended their tours by saying that many survivors of the death camps immigrated to Palestine. \nBut after the start of the IsraelHamas war, the guides noticed that some students would ask a simple but complicated question: Is this the Palestine that we’ve been hearing about? \nSo staff members at the museum, the Breman, made a few changes, according to Rabbi Joseph Prass, the museum’s education director. Now, docents explain to visitors that many Holocaust survivors found refuge in \n# \n“the British Mandate of Palestine” or “the area that would become the country of Israel.” \nEach year, roughly two dozen Holocaust museums in the United States teach millions of visitors — often students on field trips — about the Nazi genocide of six million Jews, a history that is fading from living memory. \nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the ensuing war, that mission has felt especially urgent, as the number of bias incidents against Jews has risen across the country. \n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has also forced museums to confront one of the most emotional and divisive issues within the Jewish community: how to discuss the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. \nMany Holocaust museums include the story of Israel’s founding in 1948, depicting the country as a refuge for Jewish survivors. But they often do not mention, or address only in guarded terms, a subject that increasingly interests some visitors: the Nakba, Palestinians’ term for their displacement amid Israel’s founding. \n“The question is always context,” said Debórah Dwork, a Holocaust historian at the GraduContinued on Page A20 \n\n\nA Defensive Stance in Kharkiv Ukrainians evacuating a man near the Russian border, where Moscow is retaking land.

They are locked in, and as a result, families hoping to buy their first homes are locked out. “Home affordability is the worst \nI’ve ever seen it,” said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist. A year ago, Chris and Alison Wentland were eager to sell their townhouse in the coveted Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, so they hired a real estate agent who sent a photographer to take slick photos of the house, including a 3-D video that panned from room to room. \nContinued on Page A19 \n# \n# \nLandslide to Usher In First Female President \nThis article is by Simon Romero, Natalie Kitroeff and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega. \nMIRRORS A FAILED BILL \nRestrictions Would Take Effect During Surges of Asylum Seekers \nMEXICO CITY — The margin of Claudia Sheinbaum’s election as Mexico’s president was the biggest in decades, and even as the votes were still being counted on Monday, it became clear that Mexico’s leftist governing party and its allies could be in a position to reshape the country’s political landscape. \nThe election served as a referendum on the nearly six-year term of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the current president, reflecting that a solid majority of the electorate has endorsed his stewardship of the country. Preliminary results show Morena taking seven of the nine governorships up for grabs — including the most prominent, Mexico City’s — and winning supermajorities in at least 22 of the 32 state legislatures. \nMs. Sheinbaum, the first woman and first Jewish person to be elected president, beat her opponent on Sunday by a stunning 30 percentage points or more, early returns show. She and her Morena party had been expected to win, but their resounding victory outperformed pre-election polls. \nThey appear on the verge of claiming large enough majorities in Congress to enact proposals to change the Constitution that have alarmed the opposition, including advancing contentious legislation that could potentially dismantle crucial checks on presidential power. \n“We’re taking the whole shebang in these elections,” Mario Delgado, the head of the Morena party, said in a speech on Sunday. \nDuring Mr. López Obrador’s tenure, millions of people were brought out of poverty, the minimum wage doubled and pensions became available to many more Mexicans. But he also empowered the military, prioritized fossil fuels and pushed measures that critics say could weaken Mexico’s democratic institutions. \nStill, concerns over such moves did little to sway most voters from supporting Ms. Sheinbaum, who is Mr. López Obrador’s protégée, and their party. \n“Voters gave Claudia a mandate that only a very few dared to predict,” said John Feeley, deputy chief of mission at the Continued on Page A10 \n# \nPresident Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Tuesday allowing him to temporarily seal the U.S. border with Mexico to migrants when crossings surge, a move that would suspend longtime protections for asylum seekers in the United States. \nMr. Biden’s senior aides have told members of Congress in recent days to expect him to sign the order at the White House alongside mayors from South Texas, according to several people familiar with the plans. \nThe restrictions would kick in once the number of illegal crossings exceeds $2{,}500$ in a day, according to several people who have been briefed on the order. Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Mr. Biden’s executive order could go into effect immediately. \nThe border would reopen to asylum seekers if the number of crossings stays below 1,500 for a certain period of time, the people said. They asked for anonymity because the executive order has not been officially announced. \nThe order would be the most restrictive border policy instituted by Mr. Biden, or any other modern Democrat, and echoes an effort in 2018 by President Donald J. Trump to curb migration that Democrats assailed and federal courts blocked. \nAlthough the executive action is almost certain to face legal challenges, Mr. Biden is under intense political pressure to address illegal immigration, a top concern of voters before the presidential election in November. \nThe decision shows how th Continued on Page A16 \n\nHAIYUN JIANG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES President Biden faces intense pressure on illegal migration. \n# \n# \nAlex Lawrence, a dealer in Salt Lake City who specializes in used electric cars, has seen a change over the last year in the kinds of customers who are coming into his showroom.
