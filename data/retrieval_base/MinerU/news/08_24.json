Kennedy Jr. threw his support behind former President Donald J. Trump on Friday after suspending his troubled independent campaign for president, saying he was withdrawing his name from the ballot in battleground states and that Mr. Trump had “asked to enlist me” in his second administration. \nHe announced his plans in a speech in Phoenix that also castigated the mainstream media and accused the Democratic Party of “abandoning democracy” and engaging in “legal warfare” against him and Mr. Trump. \nCampaigning in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump expressed delight with Mr. Kennedy’s decision. “That’s big,” he said. “He’s a great guy, respected by everybody.” Mr. Trump was scheduled to appear at an Arizona rally later Friday, and his campaign had told supporters to expect a “special guest.” \nMr. Kennedy’s decision to back Mr. Trump, in the final months before a closely fought general election, was a remarkable twist for the scion of a Democratic political dynasty. A longtime Democrat, Mr. Kennedy renounced his party, whose leaders in turn accused him of running as a stalking horse for Mr. Trump. \nIn his remarks, Mr. Kennedy, 70, said he had pledged to leave the race if he “became a spoiler” — a candidate with no path to victory who could nonetheless alter the \nContinued on Page A17 \nAmara Ajagu watching her great-aunt, Vice President Kamala Harris, accept the nomination. \n# \n# \nSteeling for Fight After Convention’s High \n# \nVice President Kamala Harris emerged from her nominating convention with a burst of momentum that Democrats hardly expected barely a month ago, when they thought they would be tethered to a possibly doomed re-election bid by President Biden. She has rejuvenated a once demoralized party and given a jolt of optimism to Democrats who now see victory in reach. \nCHICAGO — Joy cometh in the morning, but so do hangovers. The party in Chicago is done, the confetti has been swept up, the pictures have been posted to social media. But the real question as exuberant Democrats woke up on Friday was whether they could channel the sheer intoxication of United Center into a sustained, 74-day sprint to Election Day. \nThe buzzkill reality, however, is that victory is anything but assured. The thousands of jubilant delegates in the hall this week were not representative of the swing voters that Ms. Harris needs to defeat former President Donald J. Trump. History is littered with presidential candidates who roused their partisans at conventions only to fall short come November. And whatever else he is, Mr. Trump is no pushover. Ms. Harris can expect a bruising battle over the next two and a half months. \nShe knows that, of course, and veterans of past campaigns, including former President Bill Clinton and the former first lady \nMichelle Obama, made a point of warning ecstatic Democrats this week to temper their heady expectations. Ms. Harris has had one of the most impressive debuts of any general election candidate in recent times, yet she still faces polls within the margin of error. \n“The energy here is electric,” Representative Hillary Scholten, Democrat of Michigan, said minutes before Ms. Harris’s acceptance speech on Thursday night. “But I wouldn’t be doing my job if I said I was now feeling confident in Michigan. We’re still the underdog, and it’s going to take some true Michigan grit to turn this energy into action and secure a Michigan win.” \nMs. Scholten knows of what she speaks. She captured a Republican seat in 2022 that had not gone for a Democrat in 32 years. She understands what it takes to win in a closely divided battleground state that may be critical to victory for Ms. Harris. And she remembers when Mr. Trump surprised the world by overcoming Hillary Clinton eight years ago. \n“Getting comfortable is what happened in 2016, when we lost Michigan to Trump by less than 10,000 votes,” Ms. Scholten said. “Trump is coming to Michigan again on Monday. He’s clearly not giving up on Michigan. We can’t either.” \nBut Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, another swing state, said she thought the \nContinued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nIt was true. David Copperfield was moving in. “He might magic you out of your apartment,” someone joked. \nThe new penthouse owner arrived at the stately Galleria building in Manhattan practically unnoticed, as if standing on a dark stage just before the curtain is raised. \nWord spread. “I think I heard it from my neighbor, who heard it from the concierge,” said Emma Ruth Yulo-Kitiyakara, 78, a former resident in the building. \nThat was in 1997. Years later, the building’s residents would be well aware — painfully aware — of the world-famous magician’s sprawling, four-floor penthouse apartment. It seemed to transform be\n# \nfore their eyes from a showpiece of great wealth to an embarrassing eyesore to a leaky health hazard. \nA lawsuit filed earlier this month in New York accuses Mr. Copperfield of abandoning his penthouse apartment in a “trashed” state and allowing a valve to fail, flooding apartments and common areas below. And not Continued on Page A20 \nAnd then, according to neighbors in the Galleria, Mr. Copperfield — for his next trick — disappeared. \n\nPhotos of David Copperfield’s home included in a lawsuit this month. His lawyer said the images don’t reflect its current state. \n# \n# \nCHICAGO — They were on the prowl all week. The lobbyists, job seekers, influence peddlers, donors and all manner of ultrarich hangers-on at the Democratic National Convention. \nTo roam the luxury hotels of Chicago on any given morning or afternoon was to get a peek into the maneuvering of the well-to-do. There was casual talk of ambassadorships alongside the fried pizza bites and afternoon rosé. \n\nAt the Ritz-Carlton, there was Jeffrey Katzenberg, the campaign’s co-chair and campaign finance impresario, enjoying lunch. At the Four Seasons, there was Terry McAuliffe, the famous back\n# \nslapping Virginia politician, working the hotel bar and reminiscing about conventions of yore. Others spotted making the rounds were Blair W. Effron, a well-connected financier; John W. Rogers Jr., a top donor and the founder of the country’s largest minority-run mutual fund firm; and Ken Chenault, the former American Express chief executive who landed a speaking slot earlier in the week. Among the targets of their attention: Minyon Moore, one of Vice President Ka\n\nContinued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nMONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — A   \ndecade ago, the world had a brief   \nfascination with José Mujica.

He had robbed banks as a leftist urban guerrilla; survived 15 years as a prisoner, including by befriending a frog while kept in a hole in the ground; and helped lead the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world’s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies. \nthree-legged dog. \nBut Mr. Mujica’s legacy will be more than his colorful history and commitment to austerity. He became one of Latin America’s most influential and important figures in large part for his plainspoken philosophy on the path to a better society and happier life. Now, as Mr. Mujica puts it, he is fighting death. In April, he announced he would undergo radiation for a tumor in his \n\nesophagus. At 89 and already diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, he admitted the path to recovery would be arduous. Last week, I traveled to the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, to visit Mr. Mujica at his three-room home, full of books and jars of pickling vegetables, on the small farm where he has grown chrysanthemums for decades. As the sun set on a winter day, he was bundled in a winter jacket and wool hat in front of a wood stove. The treatment had left him weak and \n\nhardly eating. “You’re talking to a strange old   \nman,” he said, leaning in to look   \nat me closely, a glisten in his eye.   \n“I don’t fit in today’s world.” And so we began.
