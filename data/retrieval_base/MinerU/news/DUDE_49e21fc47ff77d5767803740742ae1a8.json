(A decision is expected in June 1995.) SweetHomewilldeterminewhetherthe U.S.Fish andWildlifeService(FWS) has the legal authority to prohibit landowners from using their property in otherwiselegitimate ways,simplybecause those uses inadvertently modify endangered species habitat. The case, originally filed in 1991by nine Pacific Northwestcitizens,several timber-dependent businesses and communities, and two southern timber associations, charged that theService overstepped its congressionalauthoritywhenitissued the criteria. In a 2-1 ruling on March 11, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., agreed. \n# \nCongress adopted the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973, \"to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend may be conserved . . \" The U.S.FishandWildlifeServiceandNationalMarine Fisheries Service are chargedwith the task offormulating and implementing a management plan that providesforthe“conservationand survival of the species.\"It is important to notethatonlyfederalagenciesbearthis responsibility. Private property owners maychoosetoparticipateinthis conservation effort,but the law does not obligate them to do so. \nAll citizens, however, are precluded from “taking\" an endangered species. The term“take\"means “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect\" an endangered species. Civil penalties range from a maximumof $\\$500$ for an“unknowing take,\" toafineof $\\$200,000$ and one year in prison for the \"knowing take\" of an endangered species. \n\n\n# \nTheten verbs defining“take”in the ESA describe physical actions specifically directed against endangered wildlife.“Take\"verbs donot describeinadvertentorunintentional activity.Nevertheless, FwS has promulgated regulations defining “harm\"as,\"an act which ..mayinclude significant habitatmodification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.\" \nRecords of the1973ESA Congressional debates, however, clearly reveal that Congressprovidedremediesotherthancriminal prosecution for such situations.According toRepresentative Sullivan,ChairwomanoftheHouseMerchantMarine and Fisheries Committee, Congress intended the Department of Interior to use land acquisition as the only legitimate way to deal with the issue of inadvertent \"harm\" caused by habitat modification. It deliberately deleted allreferences to habitatmodificationfrom thelistof ten verbs describing a “take.\" Following a heated debate, the verb “harm\" was also dropped from the list, but added again on \nContinued on page 2 \n# \nby David Tardif \nfederal designation of the Upper Merrimack River under the federalWild&ScenicRiversAct(WSRA) on April 12,it completed a clean sweep.The Cityof Franklinand the Towns of Boscawen, Canterbury and Northfield had already voted decisively against federal designation a yearbefore. \nIt also marked the second straight defeatfor theNationalParkService (NPS), federal designation having been rejected a year earlier by six out of seven towns on the Pemigewasset River, under the leadership of the New Hampshire Landowners Alliance (NHLA). \nIn the beginning it was an uphill battle, because the environmental establishment, including the Society for Protection of New Hampshire Forests \nContinued on page 11"

For example, trial by jury had long been the right of Englishmen. In 1696, however, Parliament passed the Acts of Trade and Navigation which declared that admiralty courts would try all cases involving commerce.Caseswhichcamebefore admiralty courts were heard by crown-appointed judges, without benefit of a jury. Since American colonies wereprimarily commercialventures,colonialissuesfell under thejurisdiction of thesecourts. \nTrial without benefit of a jury, however, was not the only“noose around the neck' of American dissidents. In 1772, the Brit\n# \nish ship, Gaspee ran aground in NarragansettBaybelowProvidence,Rhode Island while pursuing colonial smugglers. Patriots burned the Gaspee to its water line andweresent toEnglandfortrial. To combat the smuggling problem, Parliament instituted the despised“writs of assistance,\" which allowed British customs officials to enter colonial homes, withoutwarrants,and search for contraband. For these reasons, and others, the Founding Fathers codified criminal procedures within the Bill of Rights. \ncriminal law — from a vehicle for social control to one that protected private property.For example,most punishable crimes in Massachusetts during the $1600^{\\bullet}\\mathfrak{s}$ were for drunkenness and fornication.By1800, $40\\%$ ofall prosecutions in Massachusettswere for theft.Criminalswere nolongerdefined as“sinners\" againsttheirimmediatecommunities,but as people who threatened the property rights of the whole society. \n# \nAstheUnitedStatesevolvedfromanation of isolated,close-knit communities to one peopled by strangers, the Bill of Rights' mini-criminal code became increasinglymoreimportant.America's social structure changed but so did its \nDuring colonial development (before England tighteneditspolitical andlegal control), the same people that were given authority to make local rules were also given the taskofenforcing them.Therewaslittle concern,in these tight communities, whether judicial functions ought to be separatedfrom thoselegislativeorexecutive. It soon became apparent that enormous political power was enjoyed when those who sat in judgement and exacted punishment, also possessed the authority to definewhat constituted a criminal act.This situationwasfurtherexacerbatedbythe fact that new crimes were constantly being addedtostatutebooks,whilefewwereever repealed.In 1822,for example,Rhode Island possessed only fifty statutory crimes. By1872,thatnumberhadrisen.to128.“In every state,observedLawrenceFriedman inAHistory ofAmericanLaw,\"every extension of government power,every new form of regulation brought in a new batch of criminal law.In1900, there was vastly morecriminallawonthebooksthanin 1850 or 1800, hence...more crime.\" \n# \nFriedman's observations are especially pertinent in light of the explosive regulatory growth that developed during the $1970^{\\cdot}\\mathrm{s}$ To thelistofstandard crimesdefined by civilized society ——- murder, robbery, assault, violence and social disruption-thegovemmentaddedanewclass, that of environmental degradation.

Computer climate modeling is still very primitive, but the weight ofevidence is against theexistence of a global warming crisis. While globaltemperaturerecordsshowa warming of .54 degrees celsius since 1881, nearly 70 percent of the warming took place before 1930 -i.e.-before any buildup of greenhouse gases. And since 1979, the earth's atmosphere has actually cooled by 0.13 degrees. \nHunger. Food has never - never - been cheaper or more plentiful. In the Third World, food production is increasing at more than twice the rate of population growth. Since 1980 alone, world food prices have dropped by an astonishing57 percent,ascropyieldsbecomeevermore \n# \n# \nAbandon hope,advised The Progressive.The“newFourHorsemen-Overpopulation,Pollution,the Famine of Resources and Nuclear War - are riding relentlessly on their mission of destruction,\"Newsweek held out a slightly more optimisticpossibility-thatmankindfaced nottotal extinction,but“mutationinto somehumanequivalentofthecarpnow lurking in Lake Erie's fetid depths, living off poison.\" \nSo here we are a quarter-century later, about to mark Earth Day 25, not wearing gas masks,not dead of famine or nuclear incineration,not having mutated intohumancarp-andthe environmental apocalypticsaremorehystericalthan ever. The grim scenarios pour forth, growingmoredesperateandfrightful with each repetition.

        "text": "# \nby David Guernsey \names Longley, Jr., son of former independent Maine Governor James Longley, was elected last November as a Republican torepresentMaine's First Congressional District. He endorsed the Contract with America during his campaign. Subsequently he has supported HR 450, The Regulatory Transition Act; HR 925, The Private Property Protection Act; and HR 1022, The Risk Assessment andCostBenefitAct. \nIn mid March, the Sierra Club bought a series ofradio ads attackingRepresentative Longley, using their usual venal claptrap to accuse him of favoring polluters,making it harder to protect fish stocks from industrial pollution, and supportingtransferofcontroloffederal health and safety regulations to industrial polluters. Representative Longley held a press conference in Augusta,Maine,the state capitol,onMarch31,delivering the following response: \nIt'snotanaccident thattheSierra Clubchose aweek that Iwas inWashington,andunabletodefendmyself,to attack me. That's the kind of people they are,and that's the way they operate, with a form of environmental thuggerythatseeks tobully andintimidate anyonewhoseekstochallengetheir impracticalandelitistnotionsofhow tobestprotectourenvironment. \nThey've chosen to attackme for, among other things, my support of three important pieces of legislation, including: \nHR 450,The Regulatory Transition Act-abillwhichwouldestablisha moratoriumon newregulationsuntil Congress can complete its review of our entire regulatoryframework.With over 80,000 pages of federal regulations adopted last year,on top of over a 1,000,000 pages of regulations already in place, it's time to say“time out”and reassesssome of thestrategiesthatwe arepursuingtoseeiftheyareworking ornot. \nHR 925, The Private Property Protection Act - when decisions made by unaccountable and un-elected bureaucrats prevent landowners from legitimately using their land,thegovernment should beresponsibleforsomelevelofcompensation to affected citizens. When Maine people can't harvest their forest land, when they can't build homes or businesses, when they can't even sell their land as a result of governmental action-all in the name of protection-- then theycan't build a better futurefor themselves and their children, and the balance between environment and the economyhasbeenbroken. \n\nHR 1022, The Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Act - Unlike the Sierra Club, I have great respect for the 65,000 Mainecitizenswhosignedpetitions and who know a costly and ineffective automobile inspection program when they see it.What thespecial interests and the bureaucratshaven'ttoldusisthatifthis legislationhadbeenineffectin1990 Maine would have been saved the long, arduous,and nowexpensive,burdenof first adopting, and now repealing, Maine's auto emissions testing program because thelaw would have required hard scientific justification of the problem to be solved and actual, not projected,resultstobe achieved. \nI'm alsopushing toget thesecommittees tocome toMaineso that they,and thepublic,canseefirsthand,the damagethat'sbeendonetotheenvironmentalmovementby agroup ofself righteousbureaucratsallinthenameoftheir ownconceited,arrogantandself-serving view of the world. \n\nAsIsaid,this is an unvanished attempt by a group of environmental thugs to intimidateme and stop me from challenging their sacred cows. \nThey won't succeed and I won't quit \nNo members of the print media from Representative Longley's district attended the press conference, nor did any of them pick up the AP story, though the Bangor Daily News in Maine's SecondDistrict and aWashington column did cover the story. Only the Land Rights Letter correspondent had any questions for Mr. Longley, specifically asking what he might do to stop such abuses of taxexemptfunds.While not specifically responding to that question, Representative Longley stated that Congresswaslookingintothesubstantial publicfundswhichhavebeenchanneled intoprivate non-profit coffers by various schemes. \n# \nThe Sierra Club, a national environmental group, is way out of line in its current radio advertising campaign against Rep. James Longley Jr. \nThe organization is running 30-second ads in the form of a quiz program \"You Bet Your Health! that faults the 1st District Republican for failing to support legislation the group says would fight water pollution in Maine. \nThe whole thing is done in such a crudely mocking tone that the messagewhat there is of one-is lost in the histrionics.A“game show announcer,\" presumably symbolizing the Sierra Club,is loud and obnoxious.The“contestant'\"is imbecilic.Listeners at home are treated like simpletons. \nWhy the Sierra Club would choose to conduct a campaign-style negative attack on a freshman congressman from Maine just three months into his first term isbaffling. \nLongleymaybeopentolegitimatecriticismforhisvotesonenvironmental matters,but this sort of assault does not qualify. It is too offensive to persuade him to change, if that's the idea, and only puts him on the defensive. It insults the intelligence of Maine people, creates sympathy for the object of its attack and only makes the Sierra Club look like the“environmental thugs\"' that Longley calledthem. \nThe real victim of this pointless exercise is the reputation of the Sierra Club itself."

        "text": "# \nhe Lake ChamplainManagement Conference (LCMC)which evolved into the Lake Champlain Basin Program is nearing the end of its five year study and recommendation period. The Lake Champlain basin covers an area of over 8,000 square miles in Vermont, New York and Quebec, Canada. It was brought to life by the “Lake Champlain Special Designation Act of 1990.\" It was to be funded by up to $\\$5$ million per year for the five years. Actually over $\\$15$ million has been spent so far. In 1990 SenatorsLeahyandJeffords and CongressmanSandersofVermontkickedoff this effort at an environmental feeding frenzy in Burlington, Vermont. Socialist Congressman Bernie Sanders (at least he admits it) stated, “We have to clean up the Lake regardless of the cost.\"This is a testimonial to the current politics of Vermont that a Socialist has such enduring support.Most of theimpetusand the direction that have driven thisprogram have comefromtheVermontsideofthelake. \n# \nFive years of studies were conducted on Lake Champlain, which outside of the Great Lakes is the second largest lake in the nation. Unfortunately for the enviro's, little in the way of toxic pollution was found. Fish that were tested were not dangerously full of toxics, heavy metals, etc. Panic set in. The Basin Program regulatoryrecommendationswere alreadywritten but the lake wasn't cooperating. The focus shifted. Desperate for a crisis, the bureaucratic porkers at the trough and their allies in the environmental industries and government turned their attention to the plant nutrient, phosphorous. The south portion of the lake which is shallowwithaheavyclaybottomand shorelinehashighlevelsofphosphorous. I say that, using their terminology. There isnobasefromwhichtomeasurethis nutrient as being high,low or normal. Also some bays and other isolated spots tested high inphosphorous.The LCMC hung their hats on phosphorous. But, as we studied the data, it became apparent that the southlakephosphorouswas not caused by runoff in the streams.All streamsflowingintothelake,atleaston the NewYork side,showed onlyminute levels of phosphorous. In the main portion of the lake, the phosphorous was at approximatelythesamelevelasitwasin Lake Ontario. Recent reports had indicated that Lake Ontariowas so low in phosphorous that there was a possible danger to sustaining the food chain. \n\nUndaunted, the Basin Program forged ahead with a restoration and pollution prevention program. If there is one thing we have learned in five years of following such programs, it is that these initiatives are not about the environment, but rather about money and control. In their publication, “Opportunities for Action,\" the LCMC outlines a course of action to destroy farmers, bankrupt communities \nThese initiatives   \nare not about the   \nenvironment,   \nbut rather about money   \nand control. \nandreducelandownerstoserfsontheir own land.Admittedly,one has to read between the lines, and it also helps if you start atthebackof thesepublications.The authorsexpectthatmostreaderswillnot get that far. The real kicker did not come from that publication though.We found the “good stuff' in the “Report on Institutional Arrangements forWatershed Management of the LakeChamplainBasin.\" With a title like that most people wouldnotbothertogobeyondthecover exceptunderconditionsofextremeinsomnia. In here we find “... enhance cooperativerelationshipsbetweenandwithingovernmental and non-governmental Organizationswith a stake..\"Just who are these stakeholders?

(Listening sessions were first choreographedbytheNorthernForestLands Council (NFLC)when theAdirondackers ate their lunch,in more ways than one, but that is another story.
