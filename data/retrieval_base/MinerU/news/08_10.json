There were violent confrontations between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers. A neighborhood convenience store was looted and burned to the ground. The protests drew activists from across the nation, amplified the national Black Lives Matter movement and fueled larger questions about race in America. And at a more grass-roots level, it created a political incubator of emerging local leaders: A new generation of young protesters who came of age during the Ferguson uprising have found ways to chip away at the racial disparities in Ferguson and nearby St. Louis, shifting from protests to politics and policies. \nSince Mr. Brown’s death, Ferguson elected its first Black mayor. The police chief and more than half of the police officers are Black. And St. Louis County elected its first Black prosecutor. “Ferguson gave birth to all kinds of young people who were committed to civil rights and social justice and representation,” said Kimberly Norwood, a Washington University law professor and editor of “Ferguson’s Fault Lines: The Race Quake That Rocked a Nation.” \nMr. Brown’s death was part of a series of high-profile police killings over a decade, from Eric Garner to Sonya Massey. Two years before Mr. Brown died, Trayvon Martin had been killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, drawing protests across the nation. Taken collectively, the violence against African Americans catalyzed the national Black Lives Matter movement. \nResidents say there is more   \nwork to be done to rebuild trust in   \nthe community, but there have   \nbeen some changes over the decContinued on Page A11 \n\n# \nTODD HEISLER/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nNew York City is facing a collision of its biggest challenges, an influx of migrants and the enduring issue of homelessness.

Head-totoe black and très chic. \nThey are the hairstylists of the Summer Games, at the service of any Olympian in the athletes’ village in need of grooming and on a mission to substantiate that old sports mantra: look good, feel good, play good. \n“I’m not going out there looking scrappy,” Aphiwe Dimba, 23, a goalkeeper for South Africa’s field hockey team, said as she settled into a stylist’s chair last week. “It gives me more confidence after I get a cut. You never know who is taking your picture.” \nIf the Olympic Village cafeteria is a space for spontaneous social interaction, its serene salon in the main plaza is a refuge of self-care: kicking back, primping and optimizing one’s aura before it’s time to compete. The hair salon, a fixture at every Olympics, has been open this summer from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. each day. \nbekistan was getting her long blond hair braided and a BMX racer from Colombia was having her nails painted in the colors of her national flag. \nSome days there are up to 10 hairdressers arrayed in the space, all of them from top salons around France and equipped to help replicate an authentic beauty parlor and barbershop. \nThe only difference is the price: For Olympians, the haircuts are free. \n“It’s a moment for them to relax and forget the competition,” said Darygue Cordinier, who stepped away from Chopperhead, his barbershop in Paris, to work this month at the Olympics. “We’re here to take care of them.” \nBut looking good, according to athletes, is not purely a superficial pursuit. \nZigmars Raimo, a three-onthree basketball player from Latvia, said good grooming was \nContinued on Page A5 \nOn one recent morning, a race walker from Britain was having his hair trimmed, a boxer from Uz\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY CHANG W.

Trump keeps adding new tax cuts to his list of campaign promises, and their projected costs keep piling up. \nIndependent analyses suggest Mr. Trump’s plans could add close to \\$4 trillion over the next decade to America’s already fast-growing national debt, even after factoring in additional revenues from new taxes he wants to impose on imports. \nIt is impossible to make a similarly precise estimate for Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent this fall. She has not laid out any tax or spending plans, or other economic policy proposals, with enough detail to estimate whether they would add to deficits or reduce them. \nBut late Friday afternoon, Harris campaign officials said they would point to President Biden’s most recent budget proposal as an indicator of Ms. Harris’s future fiscal policy plans. That budget, released in March, calls for about \\$3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, largely by raising taxes on corporations and high earners. \nTotal federal debt is now about \\$35 trillion, up from about \\$20 trillion when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, Treasury Department data shows. It grew by about \\$7.8 trillion on Mr. Trump’s watch and has increased by about \\$7.3 trillion on Mr. Biden’s watch thus far. \nDeficit hawks in Washington warn that a further acceleration would elevate risks of an economically debilitating spiral, where rising debt pushes up borrowing costs in financial markets. That would then cause the debt to further balloon. \n“It’s a lot more troubling now, because the overall fiscal and economic environment is a lot worse” than it was before Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden took office, said Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington. \nThe next president will already be facing what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts will be growing deficits, \nContinued on Page A13 \n# \nAfter capturing several small settlements the last few days, Ukraine was battling to take full control of a town near the border and sending small units to conduct raids farther into the southwestern Russian region of Kursk. \nKYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces pressed deeper into Russia on Friday, trying to capitalize on their surprise cross-border offensive, as Moscow moved quickly to shore up its defenses against the largest assault on Russian soil since the war began. \nAt the same time, the Russian military announced it was sending more troops and armored vehicles to try to repel the attack. Russian television released videos of columns of military trucks carrying artillery pieces, heavy machine guns and tanks. \nPerhaps preparing for retaliation, Ukrainian authorities on Friday said they were evacuating 20,000 people from the Sumy region, which sits across the border from Kursk. \nThe flurry of movement underContinued on Page A8 \n\nHIROKO MASUIKE/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nIn Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing several goldfish that were in a sidewalk pit.

The Mankato West Scarlets, who had started the 1999 high school football season with a miserable record of 2-4, had improbably swaggered into a state championship game. Now, less than three minutes stood between them and a title. \nTheir defense, though, would first have to repel the CambridgeIsanti Bluejackets, who were from north of Minneapolis and trailed by a single touchdown. The quarterback hurled a desperate pass toward the end zone. But inside the 10-yard line, a Scarlet defender intercepted the ball, effectively clinching a 35-28 victory and Mankato West’s first championship. \nA coach lifted Tim Walz, then the defensive coordinator and now the Democratic candidate for vice president, skyward. In Mr. Walz’s telling, the victory also eventually proved to be a launchpad for politics. \n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her campaign are touting Mr. Walz’s coaching to broaden the ticket’s appeal, a time-tested strategy that Mr. Walz himself has long used. \nHis time as a coach serves as a glimpse into the personality he is bringing to the playing field of politics, with friendliness and warmth masking a contagious competitiveness. And Mr. Walz’s years in coaching show a ruthless willingness to change tactics as necessary. \nAs a high school coach in Minnesota and Nebraska, Mr. Walz was not a master tactician, interviews with more than a dozen players and coaches suggest, nor \nContinued on Page A12 \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \nInvestors are wondering if the next sign of sputtering economic growth could send stocks into a tailspin.
