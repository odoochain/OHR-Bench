To comply with this requirement, ACL is publishing a notice of the proposed collection of information set forth in this document. \nWith respect to the following collection of information, ACL invites comments on our burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including: \n(1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of ACL’s functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; \n(2) the accuracy of ACL’s estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used to determine burden estimates; \n(3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and \n(4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on \nrespondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques when appropriate, and other forms of information technology. \nThe Administration for Community Living (ACL) is requesting approval for a revised data collection associated with the Evaluation of the Administration for Community Living’s (ACL) American Indian, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian Programs (Older Americans Act [OAA] Title VI; short title: Evaluation of the Title VI Programs). OAA Title VI establishes grants to Native Americans for nutrition services, supportive services, and family caregiver support services. The purpose of Title VI is ‘‘to promote the delivery of supportive services, including nutrition services, to American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians that are comparable to services provided under Title III’’ (42 U.S.C. 3057), which provides nutrition, caregiver and supportive services to the broader U.S. population. Title VI is comprised of three parts; Part A provides nutrition and supportive services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, Part B provides nutrition and supportive \nservices to Native Hawaiians, and Part C provides caregiver services to any programs that have Part A/B. \nThe evaluation will consist of six data collection activities: (1) Tribal program staff interviews; (2) tribal program staff focus groups, (3) tribal elder focus groups, (4) tribal elder interviews, (5) tribal caregiver focus groups, and (6) follow-up tribal program staff interview. \nACL is requesting to revise the currently approved data collection under OMB 0985–0059 by removing the caregiver survey and adding a follow-up tribal program staff interview. The proposed revisions also include removing annual performance reporting data elements from the currently approved IC under OMB 0985–0059 to the OMB approved Title VI Annual Performance Report under OMB 0985– 0007. \nFor review and comment on this proposed information collection request, please visit the ACL website https://www.acl.gov/about-acl/publicinput. \nEstimated Program Burden: ACL estimates the burden associated with this collection of information as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Respondenttype} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Formname} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Number of annual} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Numberof responsesper} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Average burden perresponse (in hours)} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Annualburden hours} \\\\\n \\\\\nProgramdirector & Programstaffinterviewguide & 12 & 1 & 1 & 12 \\\\\nProgramdirector & Programstafffocusgroupmoderatorguide & 12 & 1 & 2 & 24 \\\\\nProgram director & Programstafffollow-upinterviewguide & 12 & 1 & 1 & 12 \\\\\nOtherProgramStaff & Tribalprogramstaff interviewguide & 12 & 1 & 1 & 12 \\\\\nOtherProgramStaff & Tribalprogramstafffocusgroup moderator & 12 & 1 & 2 & 20 \\\\\n & guide. & 100 & 1 & 2 \\\\\nTribalelder & Tribalelderfocusgroupmoderatorguide Tribalelderinterviewguide & 20 & 1 & 1 & 200 20 \\\\\nTribalelder & Tribal caregiver focus group moderator guide & 87 & 1 & 2 & 174 \\\\\nCaregiver \\\\\nTotal &  & 267 &  &  & 474 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nDated: May 12, 2020.
