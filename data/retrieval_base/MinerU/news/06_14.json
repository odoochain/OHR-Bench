In recent years, Miss USA has weathered allegations of racism and sexual harassment, and has passed from owner to owner — one of them being Donald J. Trump. The 2022 suicide of Miss USA 2019 sent the organization reeling. In 2023, Ms. Rose’s predecessor was suspended after accusations of pageant rigging. \nLast summer Ms. Rose, 45, whose legal name is Laylah Loiczly, finally achieved that goal. In an email, she said she saw “opportunities to improve, enhance and in many ways repair the iconic brand.” \nLaylah Rose says she won her first pageant at the age of 2. With dark, glossy hair and a measured smile, she went on to enter many more. Yet, even as a girl, she dreamed of something bigger. Ms. Rose didn’t only want to wear a sash, as her mother and grandmother had done before her: She wanted to run Miss USA. \nIn her first months in charge of the pageant, Ms. Rose got to work. (She bought the rights to manage Miss USA for an initial payment of \\$1.5 million, according to a prelim\n# \n# \nContinued on Page A11 \nJERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called Hamas’s response to the latest peace proposal for Gaza “negative.” Hamas insisted it was dealing with NEWS it “positively.” ANALYSIS Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, speaking in Qatar, said Hamas had demanded changes, some of which were “workable” and some not. A Hamas official told an Arabic television channel that the group had not raised any new ideas and that Mr. Blinken saw things through an Israeli lens and “speaks Hebrew.” \nSimilar scenes have played out across New York City as a task force led by the Sheriff’s Office has flexed its new emergency powers to lock down unlicensed cannabis shops, which officials recently estimated outnumbered licensed retailers in the city by about 2,900 to 62. From May 7 to June 3, inspection teams closed 311 stores, seized \\$10.4 million worth of products and issued \\$23.4 million in fines, according to the mayor’s office. An additional 325 shops were put on notice. \nPreviously, shuttered stores could reopen within hours of inspections while officials sought court orders to shut them down permanently.

But after days of intensive diplomacy in the region, a monthslong effort to end the war in Gaza seems as stuck as ever, as each side clings stubbornly to maximalist demands unacceptable to the other.

But by the time it reached the Supreme Court, the question had been narrowed to whether the agency had acted legally in 2016 and 2021, when it broadened distribution of the pill, eventually including telemedicine and mail options. \n9-0 Decision on Procedural Grounds Drug May Face Other Challenges \n“The plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote. “And F.D.A. is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing anything.” \nThe ruling handed a muted victory to abortion rights groups. Even as they praised the decision for averting severe restrictions on the availability of the pill, they warned that the outcome could be short-lived. \n“They’re going to feel this.” Following the state’s legalization of cannabis for recreational use in 2021, rogue smoke shops multiplied like an invasive species.

Kavanaugh, the court held that the antiabortion groups lacked a direct stake in the dispute, a requirement to challenge the F.D.A.’s approval of the pill, mifepristone. \nAnti-abortion groups vowed to press ahead, promising that the fight was far from over and raising the possibility that other plaintiffs, states in particular, would mount challenges to the drug. \nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday maintained access to a widely available abortion pill, rejecting a bid from a group of anti-abortion organizations and doctors to undo the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug. \n# \nSTARBUCKS RULING In a blow to labor regulators, the justices curbed their authority.

Gavin Newsom of California, a longtime ally of Mr. Katzenberg, recounted in an interview. “And he started doing that in a consistent way.” In the end, Mr. Newsom added, “He really was instrumental in getting people off the sidelines and getting them to dive headfirst in this campaign.” Few have dived headfirst into \nWASHINGTON — When President Biden made clear last year that he was planning to run for another term, some important Democratic contributors expressed doubt.

When some still did not believe him, Mr. Katzenberg challenged them to come to Washington and find out for themselves — then arranged to bring the dubious donors to the White House to sit down with the octogenarian president to convince them he was still sharp enough. \n# \nContinued on Page A13 \nContinued on Page A15 \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \nA Key City for Halting Russia Faced with an assault from the northeast, Ukrainian forces made their stand in Vovchansk.
