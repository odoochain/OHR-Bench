Wallace, Jr. Managing Editor. .RobertA.Willis [Editor.: Terrance Schubring Layout& Makeup William E. Pugh Reporter... Garth A. Jones Photographer.. James F. Falk \n# \n# \n# \n# \nMany times in the past I have requested voluntary contributions from our readers for publication in the Skywriter.Many times in the past I have been disappointed by the lack of enthusiasm with which this request was met. Now,at long last, I have a contribution. not from a fellow serviceman, but, from..well, read on you'll see! \nI could launch into a lengthy dissertation on the People to People program and tell you what an important role it plays in Japanese/American relations.I could also tell you all about how it fits into our Leadership Program. But, I'm going to save my breath. It would seem that I have already wasted my efforts in past issues of the Skywriter.I have been directing words to the wrong people! \nRead now this letter submitted to me by a Japanese employee for publication.The writer wishes to remain anonymous to avoid possible embarassment,althoughI canseenoreasonwhyhewould be embarassed. \n# \nThe O-Bon Dancing held on August 10 impressed me a great deal. It was the greatest people to people program I had ever seen. Although I have worked at other naval bases for a few years.I have never seen such a heart-warming mingling of American and Japanese people.It surely was a grand night for all of them.I believe. \nI noticed many American men wearing Yukata or Japanese summerkimono. But,I say very few American women wearing Yukata. A young Okusan （wife) in Yukata accompanying her husband and children who were also in Yukata, attracted my eyes. She wore a showy, but decent Yukata, Obi (Japanese traditional broad belt),and Japanese felt soled sandals-from every point of view she was exactly dressed as a Japanese women.Not only well fitted to Kimono style,but beautiful she was! With her up-swept hair style, upside down cone shaped posture, she looked just as though she came out of a Japanese costume book. She seemed to captivate even Japanese women's eyes.I noticed young Japanese boys and girls were sending her unsolicited applauses. \nAspindle shaped body formation is considered tobemost fitted to Kimono. I suppose western women have been believed unsuitable towearing Kimonobecause their shoulders are broader than the small, sloping shoulders of Japanese women.However,American women tend to have slimmer lower extremeties than do Japanese women, tapering sharply fromwell formedhips to feetwhileJapanesewomen tendto have O-shaped legs. In addition,American women’s heads are smaller than those of Japanese. In other words, their heads are equal to 1/8 the total length of their bodies and that is considered an ideal body formation from the aesthetic standpoint. \nThese characteristics of body structure well offset the shortcomings of broader shoulders in wearing Kimono. In this regard, the young Okusan with the up-swept hair-do was smarter in appearance than Yvette Giraud,a French chansoniere who once showed up on a TV show in Kimono with a bulky hanging hair-do. \nThe Japanese summer is hot and humid. Mu-mu or traditional Western style one piece clothes may be cooler and more convenient than Yukata.But, Yukata style is much more beautiful than the comfort -first mu-mu or one piece clothes. \nI think there were many others who dug out, that night, the long buried treasure of beauty in the American woman's Yukata style. Some must have dreamed of seeing ladies wearing Yukata at their clubs. Why don't you American ladies wear Yukato more-not only on special occasions but,daily,in the evenings at clubs,at restaruants,in the parksoronthestreet!! \n# \nA Japanese Employee. \n# \n# \nReprinted with permissionfrom Americans Abroad, copyright1961byAmericanCouncilforNationalities Seruice. \nQUESTIoN-How can your allies be expected to resist aggression if their defense by the United Stateswould mean widespread destruction ina nuclearwar? \nU.S. defense of its allies would not necessarily involve them in a total nuclear war.In the first place, the principal goal of our political and defense policies is to maintain enough deterrent strength to prevent such a war,and to enable us to negotiate effectively for world disarmament. \nIf the deterrent failed-and we aredetermined itwill not-the United States and the Soviet Union,as thenations with the greatest nuclear attack power,would be the primary victims in an all-out war. \nWe believe local aggression against an ally can be resisted by our combined military forces whose conventional weapons.A strong and highly mobile force of this type should be a deterrent to attack,and an adequate defense should an attack come."

Some of the arts of War (Bushi-do) \nhave become popular throughout the western world.Thus, the Budo-Ka student studying Karate in Chicago has, in a sense,exported the way of the Samurai to the USA. \n# \nIn the earliest times,Japanese were renowned archers with bows measuring some7 feet.Bows were so large people were said to have rested and shot them on the ground from a kneeling position. Archery was at a stand still in the Ashikaga period(1336-1573),but experienced a comeback in the Tokugawa period, even though firearms were in use. \nToday,archery has become one of Japan's leading sports with annual contests held for men and women. \n# \n# \n# \nKendo was first used as protection from attack during the Kamakura and Tokugawa periods. It is now practiced as a sport with bamboo swords instead of steel. \nOnly the most experienced men today are capable of giving exhibitions with real swords. The steel ones used for exhibitions are able to cut a piece of fine silk in MID-AIR. \nJujitsu is said to have been introduced to Japan by the Chinese in the 17th century.Dr.Jigoro Kano,a government official during thelate $1800^{\\circ}\\mathrm{s},$ is creditedfor having developed judo in Japan from the original art of jujitsu. Dr.Kano founded a judo institution in Tokyo around 1882. \nSays Lindy Auakianin hisbook \"The Secrets of Judo;\" \nJudo is a derivative of jujitsu and is the correct term used to refer to that art in today's lan guage. The word judo specifically explains the truer meaning of the art as it is practiced today. The ju part of the work means‘gentle ness'or‘giving way'and implies a flexibility of techniques,while the do part means ‘way'and signifies the application of the ju principle in the execution of the techniques, not only in physical exertions of the judoist but also in his mental attitude. The older jitsu, which was replaced by do, meant ‘technique'or‘art.” \nIn the eighteen hundreds most of the Japanese women knew judo for self-protection. \nJudo is as popular today as it was a century ago and has an increasingly number of followers."

Are we likely to solve theproblems until we Christiansrecognize thatwe,before God, are personally a part of these problems? If there is a lack of spiritual power,if an atmosphere of expectancy does not pervade our worship,can this be attributed to something beyond ourselves?The beginning of the solution may well be our own personal acceptance of and dedication to the fact that “As for me and myhouse,we will serve theLord.\" \nWhat are some personal requirements for genuine spiritual expectancytopervadeourworship? \nAdrawing near to God.A fresh view of the meaningof our Christian experience and the reality of the Christian faith we share is basic to spiritual prosperity.It is the renewing of our faith that gives us inner assurance andresources adequate to overcome any external difficulty. \nAn understanding of the divine task.The work ofa Christian and of a chapel isnot somethingofour own making.Itisnot individuallyconceived or contrived;it isnotanelectivecourse,but a divine assignment to accept.Jesus took the assignmentfrom the Father,completed his part, and that same assignment Jesus has entrusted to Christians everywherePeace be unto you:asmy Father hath sent me, even so 'send I you. Such an understanding ofour divine task will call us to a united purpose that overrides allobstacles. \nA willingness to perform our Christian task.In the work of Christ, no scheme or plan can ever substitute for the individual Christians personal service. No one else can engage in worship and fellowship with God for me.No one can serve in my stead. Could it be that the lack ofpersonal involvement on the part of so many Christians is abasicproblemforus? \nAs we enter into our tour of duty with you as Chaplain and people, we have every assurance that if we draw near to God, recognize the divine and personal nature of the Christian task,and give ourselves devotedly to the performance of the Christian ministry.Godwill supply whatever is lacking.This is indeed a difficult solution,but God is never far awaywhen we seekhisassistance. \n# \n# \nRoman Catholic \n# \nSunday Sunday   \n0845 Sunday School-all ages 0730 Mass   \n0900 Divine Worship 1130 Mass   \n1000 DivineWorship and Nursery Weekday pre-schoolage children 0630 Daily Mass   \n1800 Juniorand SeniorFellowship 1900-2000 Saturday Confessions   \n1900 Divine Worship (Vesper Services) \n# \n1630 Japanese Bible Study and Worship   \n1900 Senior Choir \n# \n# \n# \nSunday 0830 Worship Service 0730 Mass 0930 Men's Bible Class 0930 Mass 1030 Worship Service 1130 Christian Science Service Wednesday 1900 Religious Movie 2000 Christian Discussion Group"
