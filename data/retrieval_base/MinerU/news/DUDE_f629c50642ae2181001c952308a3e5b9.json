I have been with Counselior Sampson, and he received me very friendly, and showed a willingness to take the matter in. band, both on tby account, and that of the cause ; but he says it will require some tine properly to answer thy queries. \n:\" As far as I can tearn, the profits arising from the Jabour of the prisoners are seldom found in any year to be equal to their expense, for which there are many'reasona; one of which is, a considerable part of their manufactures is the work. of beginners; in such cases, even wher."

        "text": "thewill fully accompanies,the work is for the imost part attended with loss,and I believe there is no such thingas thatpersons thathavebeen robbed have any recompence for their losses, any farther than getting what they find and prove to. \n“ I think it is hardly likely the plan is in all its particulars scrupulously attended to,still I think it is even in practice boih for punishing as well as lessening crimes, the best plan that has yet been adopted in any country.\" \nA letter of a subsequent date has also been received, conveying the following additional information. \n\" In my last letter on the subject of the State Prison, I was not then able to saymuch byway of information, nor am I yet so fully as I could wish. I .told thee I had been with Counsellor Sampson, and that he seemed very willing to assist me in my inquiry, but was not then able to do itin such a manner as he would wish. I procured him a copy of a work some time ago published, by one of the inspectors of the prison; which he thinks is very full and satisfactory on the subjects of thy inquiries, and I am of .the same opinion, as it contains a particular answer to all or miost of all thy queries, by an intelligent man, who has written from his own experience. Ihavethereforeprccuredcneof the books, which. I now send; I much regret that I had no opportunity of sending it sooner. There are, I'understand, some little alterations in the prison regulations, since this work was printed, which I have no! yet been able to learn, but I understand they are trifling, and there are some alterations in the Jaws respectingthe prisoners: none are sent to it now for petit larceny, nor I believefor assault and battery: cohsequently the number of priso. ners-is not as great-as heretofore. \n\" I guestioned the writer of this book on the different particulars of thy queries, and his answers in general correspond with what he had already committed to print on these subjects. He thinks that reformation will never succeed among the prisoners,until there is aplan adopted so that each individual shall have a separate apartment at night,which is the time ihey have the opportunity of corrupting each other. At his suggestion on this subject, one state, he toid me, had lately adopted his plan.\" \nOur correpondent likewise transmitted a letter from . Counsellor Sampson, fron which the foMowing extracts are made: \nI ask your pardon for 'not sooner answering your last note. I have been absorbed in business, and the responsible careof other men's affairs. \n\" I breakfasted at the State Prison, and saw what every body can see--- prisoncrs at work, some weaving, some shoemaking, nailmaking, &c. 1 conversed with the inspectors one by one. As we were agreed before, that reformation of those who go there is bardly to be expected, so that opinion is confirmed, although thiere are'a good many exceptions. There is a variety of opinions about the  sufficiency^ of the establishment to pay its ownexpences. Colonel Tew, and some others, are of opinion, that if it were not for faulis in the internal adninistratjon, it would amply suffice. Upon the whole, the institution may, I think, be safely and largely commended, and our friends and benevolent countrymen need not abate any thing of their virtuous zeal for its promotion in Ireland. There is no criminal so likely to commit an oftence from momentary impulse, or impetuous feeling, from thoughtlessness or extravagance, as an lrish one, and such may be reformed. Wherever the crimeis the result of accident, temptation, or circumstance, and is not the consequence of rooted baseness,there may be reform.But it is certain,that the laws and their administration in some countries,are calculated jo make any people bad. The result of many opinions seems to be, that though the State Prison does not in many instances reform, yet it cannot be said to injure society.and it saves the morals of the publie from the exampleofcold anddeliberate blooished, and pro:notes gentleness of heart, and tenderness of feeling."

THAT  branch of jurisprudence which treats of crimes and their punishrnent, is of the most interesting andmomentous in the whole code oflaws. The peace, security and happiness of society depend on the wisdomandjustice of the neans devised for the precention of crimes. In no nation have legislators besto wedthatprofound attentionon this subject which' its importance demauds. \n\nWhile civilization andrefinement were changing the condition and nanners of social life, the criminal codes of the nations of Europe retained a vindictive and sanguinary spirit, the growth of a rude and barbarous age. Benevolent and vir. tuousmensawand deplored the evils produced and perpetuated by unequal and cruel punishments ; but the mild voice ofreason and humanity reached not the thrones of princes or the halls of legislators. While the State was aggrandized by conquest,enriehed by commerce, or ornamented by the productions of art, they thought not of the un. happy beings who suffered under the numerous oppressions of tyrannical laws. While everyobjectwhich eicompassed them wore the aspect of splendour and felicity, their dazzled eyes were not turned to those gloomy abodes were thevictims of injustice languished in misery and despair. \nThe art of printing, by which one·man, however private and obscure, is enabled to make himself heard by a whole people, prepared the way for reformation.' Montesquieu exposed the errors of legislators, and unfolded sounder principles of jurisprudence. Theeloquent Beccaria roused the attention of civilized Europe, and, by his unanswerable appeal toreasonand humanity, produced those successive efforts toimeliorate the system of penal laws, which constitute the greatest glory of the present age. Howard, the active and indefatigable friend of man, by exploring the prisons and dungeons of Europe, and, from their dark and unvisited recesses, brnging to light the enormous abuses and dreadfulmiseries produced by cruel laws and their corrupt administration, more powerfully awakened the feelings of humanity and justice, by which the legislator is enabled to compiete the great. work of correction."

The history of Pennsylvania presentstoourview a man who claims the praise ofbeing the frst to frame and propose a criminal code from which the punishment of death wasex:luded, except in the single case of premes ditated murder, and by which each crime received a punishment equitably proportioned to the degree of its enormity. \nIn England, where secret accusations, secret and mock trials, torture, and all the cruel contrivances of superstit:on and despotism to confound and destroy alike the innocent. andthe guilty, were unknown; where the excellent institution of a trial by jury, and humane and wise forms of lega! proceedingswere established forthe protectionofthe accnsed;where liberty was defended by law, and cherished by the spirit and manners of the people ; even in that enlightened conntry there existed a scale of punishments as sanguinary and unjust as any in Europe. The crininal delivered to imprisonment was often forgotten by the laws, and suffered an aggravation of his chastisement in the loathsome horrors of his prison, and the extor. tions and oppression of his keepers. \nNo adequate distinction was made, iu the distribution of punishnients, between a poacher and a parricide, between him who filched a loaf to satisfy the cravings of hunger, and him who first robbed and then murdered his benefactor.\\*The colonies of England adopted in general the civil and criminallawsofthepresentstate In some,the spirit of freedom which animated the first adventurers,fugitives from civil and religious tyranny, produced changes, and the gradual formation of a milderand more equitable systemof penat laws. \nWILLIAM PENN $\\cdot^{\\dagger}$ actuatedbythe pure principles of a christian and a philosopher, listening to the simple suggestions of humanity and justice, constructed the equitable code just mentioned, which he boldly enacted and transinittedtoEngland 10receive the royal assent, although the charter for the establishment of his colony expressly enjoined the introduction of the English laws. Assent to the new system was refused by the king, yet it was continved in force by the colouial legislature for thirty-five years. Disputestook place between the crown and the governor of Pennsylvania, concerning the·ordinance requiring the oficers of the government to take an oath instead of an affrmation. This contest, which kept the colony in a ferment for many years, was at length terminated by the legislature, who consented to exchange their ·favourite plan of penal laws for that of themother.country.Inreturn for this concession,the crown yielded the rightof affirmation to such as conscientiously refnsed to take an oath."

        "text": "Though' restrained for a time, the spirit of refornm revived with the revolution ; and, strengthened by the discussions of the general principles of freedom, and the writings of Beccaria and others, at length produced that system of punishment for crimes, which reflect'so much honour on that State.The new penal lawsof Pennsylvania,its prisons and penitentiary house, their progress, internal economy, and management, have been already made known by several publications. \nWhen New-York became an English colony, the laws and institutions ofEnglandwereintroduced and continued in their full extent and rigour. ‘This favourite child of the crown reflected more stronglythan any other the inage of its parent. Even after the revolution, when the spirit ofliberty ledto inquiries favourable to principles of moderation and justice,the criminalcode of this State was distinguished for its severity. It was not to be expected, that a people enamoured of freedom and a republic, should long acquiesce in a system of laws, many of them the product of barbarous usages,corrupt society,and monarchical principles, and imperfectly adapted to a new country, simple manners, and a popular form of govern ment. \nBefore giving an account of the changes that have been made in that system, it will be proper to exhibit, brieflythe several punishments as they existed antecedent to the year y796. By a law, which bears dare February'178s, the following crimes are declared punishable with death: 1. Treason ; 2. Misprision of treason; \n3. Murder; 4. Rape; 5. Sodomy; 6.Burglary7Felonionsly taking goods and chattles out of any church or place of public worship'; 8. Feloniously breaking any house, by dayorbynightanyersoneing in' the house, and thereby put in fear ; 9.Robbing any person in the dwelling-house or place of such per. son, the owner, dweller, his wife, children, or servans being in the same, or within the precincts thereof, sleeping or waking; 10. Robbing any person ; 11. Feloniously taking away goods or chattles from a dwell ing.house, the owner or any other person being therein, and put in fear; 12 Robbing any dwelling-house in the dav-time,any person being therein;13.Robbing any persou or pers sons in or about the highway ; 14 Arson, or the wilful burning any house or barn; 15. Malicious maiming and wounding another ; 16. For. gery, or counterieiting any record, charter, deed, writing, sealed wil, testament, bond, bilf of exchange,. promissory note for the payment of money, indorsement or assignment thereof, acquitance or receipt for money or goods, any bill of credit or public securities issued by Congress or any of the United States, or any gold or silver coin current in the State.-The conviction of all which felonieswas accompanied witha for feitureof the godsand chattes, lands, tenaments, and hereditaments of. the felon. All other felonies were for the first offence punishable by fine, imprisonment, or corporal punishment, or all or either of them at the discretion of the court. For the second offence the offender was to suffer death. These felonies consisted of various thefts not of the preceding description, amounting to Grand Larceny, that is, above the sum of five pounds. Stealing any record, process, &c. out of the office of the secretary of state, or of any of the courts of record; levying a fine, suffering a recovery, or acknowledging any deed, recognizance, bail or judgment, in the name of aanother not privy or consentingthereto;embezzlement of his master's goods by a servant or apprentice bove eighteen years oldto the amount of twenty shillings ; Forcible ahduetion, marrying or defling a woman ; carnal knowledge or abuse of apy child under ten years of age, &c."

He procured a number of copies of a report'on the criminal code of Pennsylvania,\\* with au account of the penitentiary there, and transmitted them to two of the membersof the legislature of New-York, then sitting in Albany, with a request that they might be distributed among the members, who, on their return home to their respective counties, might communicate themi to the people, whose attention would thus be called to a similar reformation in their ownJaws. The same citizen, in 1795, nade several visits to the prisons in Philadelphia, for the purpose of obtaining complete and satisfac. tory information of the operation and effects of the new system of punishment established, in which he received ample assistance from his worthy and intelligent friend Caleb Lownes. \nThe result of these inquiries was communicatedbyhimtoGeneral Schuyler, a distingvished member of the Senate of this State. This public-spirited  senator. perceiving the great importance of the subject,and thewisdomof an experiment so loudly demanded by humanity, visited, in company with the same person, the Rhiladelphia penitentiary, and witnessed,with surprise and satisfaction,the spirit·of wisdom and benevolencewhich piesidediu that institution ; the cleanliness, decency, order, and tranquil industry which prevailed inevery part, With minds deeply impressed with what they had seen and heard, they returbed to the city of New-Yorh, where the legis. laturewerethen convened.Afew citizens,actuated by the same sentiments were consulted, and a ptan of reform, in a bill \\* for making alterations in the criminal laws of the State, and the erecting of state prisons,' wasprepared byGeneral Schuyler. and in four days after his return, was presented to the senate. The bill was introduced by an able and aninated speech of the mover; and after having being powertully supported by. several members,\\* was carried,with only one _dissenting voice ; and in the bouse of assembiy with about nine opposing votes. This bill, after passing the usual forms, became a law on the -26th March, $1796.\\dagger$ \n\nBy this law, which has received \n\\* Among these Ambrose Spencer, esq. particularly distinguished himself as a most zealous friend to the proposed reform. \n$\\dagger$ By this law, two state-prisons were directed to be built ; one at New-York, and the other at Albany. The plan of a prison at Albany was afterwards relinquished, and the whole of the money appropriated for both prisons was directed to be appliedto the one in the city of New-York. John Watts, Matthew Clarkson, Thomas Eddy, John Murray, jun. and Isaac Stoutenburgh, were appointed commissioners for building the prison."

All ofences above the de. gree of petit larceny, and not included in the above description, or otherwise punished, and stealing from a church, (before a capital offence) are made punishable for the first of. fence with imprisonment in the state prison to hard labour or solitude, all oreither of them,atthe discretion of.the court, for a term not exceeding fourteen years.  For the second offence the punishment is increased to imprisonment for life, hard labour or solitude, or both. Petit larcenies, buying and receiving stolen goods, &c. obtaining money，goods,&c. by fraud under false pretences, for the first offenceare subjected toimprisonment, hard labour, or solitude, or both, or inprisonment only,as the court may direct, for a term not ex. ceeding one year ; persons guilty of a second offence have their punish. ment augmented for a time not exceeding three years. \nPersons  sentenced to  imprisonment for any time less than tuwelze months, are confined in the county gaols, and cannot be sent to the stateprison. \n. Corporal punishment is wholly.abo. lished; and no conviction or attainder for any crime, except treason, can work any forfeiture of goods, chattles, lands, tenaments, or hereditaments, or any right therein ; and all forfeitures in nature of deodand, and in cases of suicide, or flight from justice, are done away. \nTo prevent escapes, by a law in alteration of the first law, persons seatenced for life, who break out and escape from the prison, and cominit any felony above the degree of petit larceny, are punishable with death. Convicts sentenced to imprisonment for a term of years, who break out of prison, and are afterwards retaken, are to undergo imprisonment for a period doubie the time specified in the origiral judgment, to commence from thie tine of the last conviction, though at the time of being retaken, the original term had ·been expired ; and as often as auy person, yot adjudged to imprisoament for life, shall escape from prison, the period for which he was sentenced shall commenca anew from the time of his escape. \n\nThe friends of reform were sensible that the new law was imperfect. The substituting of imprisonment for life for the punishment of death in certain cases,did not aiter the relative proportion of punishment for crimes of ditferent degrees of malignity; $\\ast$ andif gnilty a second time of the same offence, thoughindegree inferiortothehighest crime,the criininal is subjected to the highest penaity. Great changes, bowever, in matters so deeply interesting to the community, should not be tro suddenly made. The wark of reformation is slow, and must encounter many and strong prejudices, and the force of long-established opinions. It was prudent to listeu to the voice ofthose who advised a forbearance of further change till experience had fully ascertained the advantages and defect of the new system. These will be graduallydeveloped in·the progress of the experiment ; but manyyears are necessary toits completion. A slight acquaintance with the nature ofman and the history of society is sufficient to convince the considerate and i passionate observer that thefulleffectsofaninstitution of this kind cannot be felt, nor the trial of its wisdom and efficacy be fairly and satisfactorily made, until after a long and presevering attention to its managenent and operations."

They, sometimes, even express a regret at the chauge which has been wrought in our laws, and returning toa systemof accumulated severity and terror, wish to see every offence against life and property punishedwith death; as if crimes would cease with the extermination of the criminal. But let such turn their eyes inward upon their own hearts, and analyze thesource from whence such wisbes arise. Let them 'consider the eflects produced onsociety and manners bythe ra pid increase of weaith and luxury, natural population, and emigration, which consequently augment the number of crimes, whether the laws be mild or sanguinary. Letthem consuit reason, and the experience of the most enlightened nations, which prove beyond all contradiction, that crimes are most frequent where the laws are most rigorous; that punishments mild and certain more effectually prevent crimes than those which are sanguinary and severe. Let them at least examine, before they condemn,a system sanctioned by different legislatures, prudent and enlightened,andapplaudedby the wisest and best men'in all civilized countries. \n\nA CORRESPONDENT requests the Proprietors of the Belfast Monthly Magazine may insert the following character of Thomas Paine.
