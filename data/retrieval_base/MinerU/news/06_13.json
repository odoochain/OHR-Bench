In a sport that demands an alchemy of sinewy resolve and highaltitude faith, Mr. Lama did everything his client did and more. But she received most of the money, fame and attention. \nThe kind of lucrative endorsements enjoyed by foreign athletes are not usually given to Nepal’s ethnic Sherpas. For them, the profession of Himalayan guide offers a path out of deep poverty, but also a possible route — strewn with avalanches and icefalls — to a premature death. \nMr. Lama could not afford to rest after guiding the Norwegian, he told The New York Times.

He could not read or write, but he wanted his sons to get the best education, a costly endeavor. \nSo only three months after climbing the 14 peaks, Mr. Lama was back working as a Sherpa — his name, his ethnicity, his profession and, ultimately, his fate. Another foreigner chasing another record had hired him as a guide. This time, it was Gina Marie Rzucidlo, who was trying to become the first American woman to climb the world’s tallest mountains. Another American woman, also guided by a Sherpa, was climbing separately in pursuit of the same record. \nBut on Oct. 7, avalanches broke loose on Mount Shishapangma in Tibet. Both pairs of climbers were killed. \nMr. Lama’s death was the latest in a series of tragedies to shear his family tree of siblings.

West was a consultant for the team in recent years. \nFor four decades, first as a player and later as a scout, a coach and an executive, West played a formidable role in the evolution of the N.B.A. in general and the Lakers in particular, beginning in 1960, when the team moved from Minneapolis to Los Angeles and he was its first draft choice. \nDuring his tenure, the Lakers buzzed almost perpetually around the championship, but West had the misfortune to play while the Boston Celtics, with Bill Russell at Continued on Page A25 \nHe won championships with several generations of Laker teams and Laker stars and was an All-Star in each of his 14 seasons.

It branded Israel’s assault on the territory a “genocide,” and the leaders of her university responded by urging her to resign. That was soon after the war began on Oct. 7. Months later, the professor drew even more scrutiny for saying it was time to “abolish Zionism” and accusing Israel of politicizing rape. She was briefly suspended in March by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she has taught law and social work for nearly three decades. But right-wing Israeli politicians demanded more severe punishment, and in April, the police detained her overnight. \nThe professor is now under investigation for incitement to terrorism — a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. And though she has not been charged, her case has prompted a profound debate inside Israel about the repression of free speech and academic freedom since the war began more than eight months ago. \nThe professor’s lawyers say she is being punished for her political views. And some other Israeli professors and students worry that the country’s universities — which had long defended the values of relative diversity and openmindedness — have contributed to the suppression of dissent. \nWhile universities argue they are simply trying to keep campuses calm, critics say there is a clear double standard across Israeli society: Violent rhetoric toward Palestinians from Jewish Israelis is often brushed aside, while Palestinian citizens of Israel who express support for Palestinians in Gaza or criticize the conduct of the war face discipline or even criminal investigation. \nAs of May, police records show, 162 indictments for incitement to terrorism had been filed since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Nearly every case, according to Adalah, a legal center for the rights of the Arab minority in Israel, involved Arab citizens of Israel or Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, who mostly declined offers of citizenship after IsContinued on Page A8 \n“I have been persecuted and defamed, my academic production of knowledge flattened, and my home and even my own bedroom invaded,” Professor ShalhoubKevorkian, 64, told The New York Times. \nMall, Hotel, Mines and Chemical Companies Up for Auction \n# \nCrowds gathered on the square in front of the 14-story hotel to celebrate the fall of the Soviet Union.

The vote was an indication that evangelicals are increasingly open to arguments that equate embryos with human life, and that two years after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, “fetal personhood” may be the next front for the anti-abortion movement. \nMore than 10,000 delegates, called “messengers,” have gathered in Indianapolis for the denomination’s annual meeting, which is closely watched as a barometer of evangelical sentiment on a variety of cultural and political issues. The vote on Wednesday was the first time that attendees at the Southern Baptist meeting have addressed the ethics of in vitro fertilization directly. \n\nThe resolution proposed on Wednesday called on Southern Baptists “to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation, especially in the number of embryos generated in the I.V.F. process.” \nIt also exhorted them to “advocate for the government to restrain” actions inconsistent with the dignity of “every human being, which necessarily includes \nContinued on Page A22 \n# \n# \n# \n# \nNadal and Alcaraz to Team Up Spain’s Olympic tennis squad will include the doubles pair of Rafael Nadal, 38, and Carlos Alcaraz, 21.
