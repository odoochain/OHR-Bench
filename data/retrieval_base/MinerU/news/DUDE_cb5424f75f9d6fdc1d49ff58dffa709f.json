        "text": "# \nVicente was in a holding cell at Area 5 after being arrested for 3 arnied robberies and a simple robbery in the spring of 1993. He was high on heroin at the time, though \"'not thc way a heroin addict would wanna be.\" Vicente was a member of the Imperial Gangsters street gang (affiliate of the Folks). Several cells away from him was Bouto, a inember of the Pueno Rican Stones street gang (affiliate of the People). Betwcen Vicentc and Bouto were 2 black men in cells, but Vicente doesn't remember their names. \n\\*\\*According to Edwin Maldonado's testimony, Muldonodo may have been one of these men. Maldonado, however, is not bluck. In Maldonado's slalement, he claimed that his was the only cell in between Boulo and Vicenie, so we hove to be careful here. \nVicente and Boulo were shouting to one another, killing tinme. \"He got some weed, we chillin'.\" He asked Bouto \"What do they got you for?\" Bouto replied \"Man, they tryin' 1o get me for this murder.\" He said that the police were trying to question him about it, bui he at no point admitted to the crime. According to Vicente, the friendly conversation lasted several hours. \"We was kickin' it, we was talkin' shit.\" \n\"When you'rc in a holding ce!!.\" Vicente said,\"there's a turn-key (guard) standin' up above.\" \"Thcy keep a camera on you to monitor you. If you call, they'll turn on an intercom. They wanted Bouto so bad.\" \nThe turn-kcy pulled Vicente from his cell and took him to an interrogation room where he met with Guevara and Halvorsen. Halvorsen offered to buy him candy bars and a pop, and he accepted. They bought him \"a couplea Snickers bars.\" Sugar helps heroin addicts on their comedown from the drug. They asked him whal he and Bouto had been talking about. They also asked if Vicente knew what gang Bouto was in, playing on the fact tha1 Bouto's gang rivaled Vicente's. According to Vicente, Guevara said “We want you to do something for us.\" \n\"Thty wanted me to go down and get Bouto to talk to me as long as I could. Bouto was held back for a day or two so we could stay together.\" Bouto was held back at Grand and Central Station instead of taking a bus that day Cook County, Vicente said \n\"We can rmake it hard for you, or easy for you.\" they said. Vicente noted that while Guevara was playing tough, Halvorsen was playing the good cop role, assuring him hat cvcryhing was going to be all right, etc. \n\"This is whal we want you to say,\" they toki hin. \"Talk to hin, carry ont a little friendship. Say that he shot somebody at a high school, wbich was Roosevelt high schoo!.\" Guevara and Halverson did not give Vicenle the victim's name, bccause he didn'I need it. A state's attorney was coming, and Vicente was supposed to tell him/her that (che state agent (Bouto) shot somcbody behind Roosevelt High School. \n\"I said, 'What the fuck? Hell no!' Your first law [as a gang member] is silence and secrecy. You are not to tell on anybody... not on your own, not any other criminal.\" When Vicente refused, the detectives again reminded him of the gang rivalries between him and Bouto. Guevara said that he would help Vicente, and said that he would get Vicente a deal with his own sentence. He said that he wouid speak up for Vicente in count. He offered to put Vicente into the Witness Protection Program in Cook County Jail. Vicente again refused, and then Guevara \"hit mc upside the head a few good times.\" Vicente said that Guevara hit him on the back of the head with his hand, where the injuries would nol be visible."

        "text": "Guevara and Halvorsen left the room and spoke with one anothcr outside of the room. Guevara rerumed to the room and hit Vicente again on the back of the head, this time with a \"skinny phone book\" that he had carmied rolled up in his pocket. Guevara spoke to him in Spanish. He called Vicente a \"stupid.son of a bitch\" and ordered him to \"Fuckin' help me.\" Halvorsen remained outside of the room. \n\"Everybody [in the office] knew what was happening in that room,\" said Vicente. Afer 2 hours. Viccnte gave in. Guevara and Halvorsen sent Vicente back to his holding cell. \n\"You're not gonna tell anybody what was happening in that room,\" thcy told him. They told him tha1 they weren't going to make any promises to hin, but that they would put him in the Witness Protection Program (WPP), that he wouldn't have to be in population, he would go to the \"Q.\" They said that they promised they could help him, although they couldn't promise how, but that they would make sure he got thc minimum sentence and not the ma ximum. Vicente said the pronises were made in very general terms and that since he had never bcen arrested before or been through the system he did not understand how things worked. \n(In the WPP, Vicente says he had steaks, pizzas, 2 visits every day, street clothes, jewelry. \"'The state's attorney buys you clothes from petty cash.\" He was allowed 2 free phone calts per day. He didn't like it, though, because it was located in Division I in the basement, where there were rats and the building was falling apart.) \nThe Assistant State's Attornty came in to ste Vicente at Grand and Central. Vicente said she was a \"rookie,\" new at her job, and didn't question the fishy behavior. \"She showed me her credentials. She wrote everything out. Guevara and Halvorsent were lthere. I told her that Bouto told me that he shot somcbody outside the high school, Roosevelt High School.\" \n\\*\\*Note - Vicente ALWAYS stated these rwo facts separately. Bouto shot someone outside a highi school;: which was Roosevclt High School. \n\"1 was told to tell Bouto that they pul me in some more lineups.\" Vicenle said, whcn asked how he explained.his absences to Bouto. Vicente said that Guevara told him that \"lf you tell anyone [the truth), they'll start calling you a ralt, a snitch. You'll get fucked. up.\" \n\"Everytine I reviewed my satement, it got bener and beller and better.\" \nTlree days laler, Vicente was moved to a different building. be was moved to Division 10, where he was put in a gallery. lt was general population. He was finally separaled from Bouto afer three days of processing. He said that he knew that the separation occurred because Bouto would eventually find out what had happened, and they didn't want him and Vicente on the same gallery."

        "text": "\\*\\*Note: This move was potentially the bus ride during which Vicente confcssed the snitching to Lydel! Williams. We showed Vicente ihe photograph of Williams, bul he didn't recognize the face. \n\"I'm in 3B or 3D Gallery. After one week, I get a pass. Il's a printout saying where you're going.\" The pass says Vicente is going to court; but he knows that because he doesn't have a count date yet, he will actually be taken to the State's Atorney's office. \"I tell everybody I'm going to coun.\" The investigators bring him to the office \nVicente waited in the bullpen from Sam until 11:30 am. \nHe was taken up.in an elevator quietly and handed to the Cook County State's Attorney's office investigators. They put him in a freight elevator and walked him around the courtrooms and through the metal detectors to the State's Attorney's office. He was in bandcuffs. \"1 saw pictures and mug shots of inmates.\" Eventually, Halvorsen and Guevara came in and started talking to Vicente \"nicely.\" They uncuffed him. Vicente met John Dillon and Matt Coughlan. \n\"Guevara told me, 'You're an IG. This is what we want you to know.\" Thcy started talking 1o him, and showing him crime scene photos from the murder of Rodrigo Yargas. \"They already knew who they wantcd for the murder.\" \n\"They said that somebody was killed in a van. A stickup murder. The body was at the stene. It was all shot up. It was a hooked up, customized Chevy van.\" \nGuevara told Viccntc that \"This is my way of telling you that thc word on the street has it that\" Pisiol Pete, Armando and Jordan committed the crime. \nGuevara contimued \"We want you to say that you were there, you wtre driving the car, you saw it.\" Vicente wouldn'1 do it even though the detectives told him that they would say hc had no knowledge of the intent to murder Vargas. \n\"We're here to talk to you about this, and to inove you to a special place,”\" the detectives told hiun. Vicente said that he was forced to go lo the Q because of his safety. Hle was disappointed because his current cellnrate had been getling heroin froni a guard. His name was \"Buzz,\" and he was a Spanish Lord, charged with the inlentional murder of apoliceman. \n\"The judge gave me an I-bond, a S50,000 I-bond. I was told to tell my cellmate I was leaving, not that I was testifying, and he would pack my stuff.\" \nVicente said that he and Guevara argued in a separate room. Vicenle told Guevara that he wasn't going to do i, and they reached a coinpromise. The conversation lasted for aboui three hours. \"How bout if you say that afer the murder, they told you"

        "text": "and they gave you the gun...\" again, Vicente refused. He rcfused any story thar placed him at the scene of the crime, or gave him anything lo do with the crimc or the followup. \n\"Okay, you were standing on a corner of Harding and Altgeld (Vicente lived there and Halvorsen knew that), you guys ended up on the porch and you were talking.\" The thrcc accused told Vicente that they had been driving down the street when they saw some guy that they stuck up for some chain, whicl they sold 1o a jewclry store. Thcy saw some victim at a gas station, they saw thc cash in his hand. \"We had \\$2 for gas, we needed money for gas to go to fhe dope spot,\" the accused told Vicente. After they saw Vargas at the gas station and saw the moncy in his band, \"We were following the car and the wife started looking; we're young guys, we followed thc car to where they lived, and we watched them. We waited until 5 m... \nAccording to the story, the trio got Vicente into their car at the corner of Hamlin and Aligeld. They put the gun in the vent, and Vicente and one of the guys started arguing. \"Mondo fucked up,\" thcy said, and they would never have had to kil Vargas if Mondo wouldn't have fucked yp. The four ended up on Vicente's mother's porch. \n\"Coughlan and Dillon knew what was happening behind closed doors. They were siting there listening. When Guevara was brainstorming, Guevara said \"We've already got you on this case [Bouto]. you might as well go all the way. Everyone's gonna know what you did, you'ltl be a snitch.\" Vicente said that he was on dnugs again. Halvorsen assured him thai \"We're gonna make sure that you don't get charged, (with the murder of Vargas) you don't get sentenced, cverything will be all right.\" \nTwo State's Attorney's were sitting with Vicente at the time, writing down tlhe statemen! with Halvorseu and Guevara coaching him. They would prompt him with “Didn't you say...\" \"'Didn't he say...\" ttc. They coached because they hadn't givcn Vicente time lo memorize the story. \"] wanted to get back lo thc bulpen,\" Vicente said, \"so I could ger fucked up.\" \nWhile in the State's Attorney's office someone showed Vicente an Iinperial Gangsters tattoo in a pholograph and asked him to identify the siguificance of the symbol. rhey wanted him to gel up on the stand. \"l gave thein what 1hcy wanted...thc gangster crown, the letters, and the name under the tattoo began with an 'M'. They didn't tell me the victim's name Or where he lived. They fabricated thc wholc slory.\" Note: Yhis was an unrelated story. The ASA's wanted Vicente to testify as a sort of gang expert in a cuse thal was fotally unrelated co any of the three he testified in. lt was nol clear if it even was Dillon or Coughlin usking him to identify the significance of the symbo!. \nThe state's attorney's never talked to Guevara or Halvorsen about the coaching in front of Vicentc."

        "text": "\"They kept calling me over there every 3-4 days. They came up with the theory of Iglesias and they said that me and Iglesias would be in the same bullpen, where we would carry oul a conversation. I'd nevcr met Iglesias. Never seen him, never ran into him. Guevara showed me a picture of 'Snake' (Iglesias). He had sliced-up cyebrows, which are dense. \nI would say that Iglesias told me that he intended to shoot her in the head.\" Here, we had some discrepancies in our notes: we think he said that he was suppose t0 say when he was on his way to court and in the bull pen, Iglesias told hin. Yicente also mentioned Canton, Hl. around the same time, but we think thul that wns in relation to a later date, afler he hud already testified \n# \n\"They fucked me (figuratively).\" I got six years for the armed robberies and 3 years for the simple robberies. The six should've eaten the 3 while I'm doin' it. When they seen what happened with Pacheco, Coughlan was furious. For six weeks they were calling me over, coaching me. My ex wife wouid come over, no patting her down, I was uncuffed. She would bring drugs. I would stash it. Guevara and Halvorsen as well as the ASA's would order Vicente chicken, burritos, other food. Guevara would give him money when he asked for it. He used thc money on cigaretles or gave it to his wife when she visited. \"The total - 1 got him for at least two or three hundred dollars in cash. He knew I was buying tobacco.\" \nVicente didn't go inio too much detail, but he did make it clear that he was allowed conjugal visits with both his ex-wife and with Michele. Gia Grace, his daughter, is living proof of these special favors - he admits that his daughter's middle name was chosen to represent the grace by which he was able to \"propagate his seed,\" etc. elc. Her first name, Gia, was the naine of a very beautifu! supermodel who died of a dnug overdose. \nAfter the (Serrano?) trial, Guevara and Halvorsen gave Vicente 2 soldier bottles of J&B, which he drank. He then passed out. \nVicente was allowed Polaroid photos with his wife and her kids. \"Most of my jewelry and most of my clothes, John Dillon and Malt Coughlan bought for mc. Every time l went lo the Slaie's Aliorney's office, they [Guevara and Hlalvorsen] wcre there. The dea! was that the six years ate up the 3 years, but the tawyer argucd about il with John Dillon about ne getling six years.\" \n\"They were not happy with my performance in Monianez or Iglesias. 1 wasn't happy where I was at, there was no schooling at the WPP. Many lines I thought about backing oul. 1 would yell at Coughlan and they would call Gucvara. I chased this guy with a stick and beat this black guy in the Q so I could gel out of there. They gave me an l-. Bond, they moved me to DuPage. I staned a fight. They sent tne back to Cook County Jail but put rne in a Protective Custody gallery."

I had clothes, jewelry, and money sent to me to send hom. The day it was over was the day they had used me for all their cases and they had me in Big Muddy River in SMU. Sometimes I'd get a call from John Dillon, he'd ask if I was all right.\" \nVicente reccived S1200 plus \\$400 or S500 moving expenses through the Relocation Program. He named a State's Attorney representative, Luz, who took his fingerprint and thumbprint and a Polaroid photo for the prograin. She called him and he reponed to pick uphis check. \n\"I had to go two timcs, or one time every week,\" to talk with the ASA's about the cases \"I calied my ex wife and I told her it's done. I had known her prior to coming to prison. I couidn't tell ANYONE that I was lying. Half the time I would tcll them what I wanted to tell them, half the time I was told 'You need to say this, you need to memorize this.\" \n\nHalvorsen and Guevara didn't know I was friends with Pete. They didn't know about Armando and the fight, didn't know aboun the muffler. I wasn't trying to volunteer anything. I knew who Jordan was because Jordan's a prelty popular guy. I grew up with him. I knew his brothers, Angel and Drek, his sister. His father's always in jail. \nThere was a little Pistol Pee from Fullernton and Kenmore. There was one from North and Hamlin (Montanez). Halvorsen tried to figure out which one was Montanez, and thal's when we went through. Halvorsen knew it was the big one. \nThere is paperwork signed from John Dillon. The state's altorney wrole up that I went to Officer Halvorsen and Guevara at Grand and Central. This was to try and make it look like Vicente had volunteered 1hc information, Vicente said. When they coached me, Guevara and Halvorsen were both there. Halvorsen was brainstorming thc stories along with Guevara. Guevara is the leading man. He tells Halvorsen what to do. The two detectives poked Vicente in the head while they coached him. \nDouna Kowalski (mentioned here, but not explained in iny notcs) \nA few times, Michele asked me about all this, but I told her not lo ask.
