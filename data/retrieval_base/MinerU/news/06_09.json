Trump routinely blames President Biden for higher prices at the grocery store and everywhere else Americans shop, and promises to “fix it.” \nBut Mr. Trump has offered little explanation about how his plans would lower prices. And several of his policies — whatever their merits on other grounds — would instead put new upward pressure on prices, according to interviews with half a dozen economists. \nMr. Trump says he plans the “largest domestic deportation in American history,” which would most likely increase the cost of labor. He intends to impose a new tariff on nearly all imported goods, which would probably raise their prices and those of any domestic-made competitors. \nAnd he not only wants to make permanent the entire deficit-financed tax cut law he and congressional Republicans enacted in 2017, but also to add some kind of new “big tax cut” for individuals and businesses, which would stimulate an economy already at full employment. \nAs a matter of textbook eco  \nnomics, each of those three signa  \nture Trump policy plans would be   \nlikely to raise prices. Some could   \neven cause continued, rather than   \none-time, price increases — add  \ning to the possibility of inflation. “I think we can say with a lot of   \nconfidence that President   \nTrump’s trade policies and immi  \ngration policies would result in   \nprice spikes,” said Michael Strain, Continued on Page 16 \n# \n# \nLAS VEGAS — O.J. Simpson, even in his final years, was somewhat of a spectacle. \nIn his presence, heads turned and whispers swirled. There was no story about him without that white Ford Bronco, the bloody gloves, the two chilling murders. \nWhen he settled in Las Vegas seven years ago, it seemed fitting that he would choose a city of escape and second acts. Here, he became a man about town, known for pulling up to a steakhouse in a Bentley convertible, appearing at lavish parties and posing for selfies. \nHis lifestyle was comfortable — and far too pleasant to those who believed he deserved to spend his remaining days in prison. \nBut there was one element that made him feel accepted in Las Vegas. A little-known golf crew called In the Cup. \nIts 40 or so members are neither wealthy nor powerful. They play at public courses, not lush country clubs. They are military veterans, retired police officers, small business owners, airport security workers. \nMost are Black. And none of them cared about Mr. Simpson’s past. \n“It’s not something we talked about, not something we discussed, not something we went into. We left it alone,” said one \nContinued on Page 18 \n\nAlmog Meir Jan, 22, was one of hundreds of people kidnapped by Palestinian militants during a music festival on Oct. 7 in Israel. \n# \n# \n# \n# \nTAKORADI, Ghana — In the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States rushed troops and military aid to a swath of West Africa to help French forces stop the spread of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. \nMore than a decade later, and with hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance spent, that regional counterterrorism effort has largely failed. \nGroups that have declared allegiance to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are on the march. Military coups have toppled civilian-led governments in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger. The new leaders have ordered American and French troops out, and in some cases invited Russian mercenaries in to take their place. As the United States withdraws \n1,000 military personnel from Niger and shutters a \\$110 million air base there by September, U.S. officials are scrambling to work with a new set of countries in coastal West Africa to battle a violent extremist insurgency that they perceive is steadily seeping south. \n“Of course, it’s frustrating,” Christopher P. Maier, the Pentagon’s top official for special operations policy, said in an interview. “Our general desire to promote democratic governments and having healthy governance there has not gone particularly well.” \nThe U.S. military has had more success training local counterterrorism troops, Mr. Maier said, although some participated in the military takeovers. But, he added, “it’s disappointing when we’ve in\nContinued on Page 12 \nGOLDFIELD, Nev. — Cindy Elgan glanced into the lobby of her office and saw a sheriff’s deputy waiting at the front counter. “Let’s start a video recording, just in case this goes sideways,” Elgan, 65, told one of her employees in the Esmeralda County clerk’s office. She had come to expect skepticism, conspiracy theories and even threats related to her job as an election administrator. She grabbed her annotated booklet of Nevada state laws, said a prayer for patience and walked into the lobby to confront the latest challenge to America’s electoral process. \nThe deputy was standing alongside a woman that Elgan recognized as Mary Jane Zakas, $^{77,}$ a longtime elementary schoolteacher and a leader in the local \nRepublican Party. She often asked for a sheriff’s deputy to accompany her to the elections office, in case her meetings became contentious. \n“Hi, Mary Jane. What can I do for you today?” Elgan asked, as she slid a bowl of candy across the counter. \n“I hope you’re having a blessed morning,” Zakas said. “Unfortunately, a lot of people are still very concerned about the security of their votes. They’ve lost all trust in the system.” \n“I’d be happy to answer any questions and explain our process again,” Elgan said. \n“We’re beyond that,” Zakas said. She reached into her purse and set a notarized form on the counter.

All four were in good medical condition and were transferred to a hospital in Israel for further examinations, the Israeli authorities said in a statement. \nJERUSALEM — Israeli soldiers and special operations police rescued four hostages from Gaza on Saturday amid a heavy air and ground assault and flew them back to Israel by helicopter to be reunited with their families. The news was met with jubilation in Israel, where anxieties over the fate of the roughly 120 remaining captives have been rising after eight months of war. \nResidents in the town of Nuseirat, where the hostages were being held, reported intense bombardments during the rescue operation. Khalil al-Daqran, an official at a hospital in the city, told reporters that scores of Palestinians had been killed and that the hospital’s wards and corridors were packed with the wounded. \nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters the rescue mission took place around 11 a.m. Saturday, when forces located the four hostages in two separate buildings where they were being held by Hamas militants. He said the Israeli forces came under fire but managed to extract the hostages in two helicopters. One special forces police officer died. \nThe fate of the hostages has been a source of intense political pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, amid the broader criticism that his government, for its own reasons, is in \nContinued on Page 8 \nWILLIAM A.

When I head out on patrol, I drink an energy drink. Before an attack, I drink an energy drink,” said one Ukrainian soldier who identified himself by his call sign, Psycho, for security reasons, according to military protocol. \n“Let me explain something as a reconnaissance person,” Psycho continued. “When you have to walk three, four or seven kilometers.
