The victim in the case had refused to testify, and now prosecutors were offering him a deal: He could plead guilty to a felony assault charge and be released that day. \nThe judge, Donald Leo, warned Mr. Davon-Bonilla, a 24-year-old from Nicaragua, that he could be deported. \n“Do you still wish to proceed with your plea of guilty?” asked Justice Leo, according to a tran\nFailure of Cooperation   \nBetween ICE and   \nCity Is Blamed \nscript of the hearing. “Of course,” he replied. \nMr. Davon-Bonilla did not show   \nup for his sentencing on Aug. 9.   \nTwo days later, the police say, he Continued on Page A12 \nIn fact, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, had informed the city that it intended to deport Mr. Davon-Bonilla when he was charged with rape, the agency said. But neither the city nor the Brooklyn district attorney notified federal officials when he was released that day in June. \n# \nHigh above an arena packed with Democratic delegates in Chicago last week, a video introduced the life story of Kamala Harris to the world. \n“Behind me is where it all began,” said her childhood friend, Stacey Johnson-Batiste, standing in front of a charming yellow, twostory home where Ms. Harris grew up in a small apartment above a nursery school. \nBut where was that exactly? The screen simply read “East Bay,” as in the eastern section of the San Francisco Bay Area that sprawls over 1,400 square miles and is home to nearly three million people. Ms. Harris called the area just “the bay” in her speech on Thursday night. Other speak\nTrading Liberal Mecca for a City That’s Not Quite So .. .

Outgunned, the soldiers repelled the first two assaults, but suffered many casualties. \nAs Ms. Chornohuz bandaged the head of a wounded platoon commander, she said a third attack broke through, forcing the Ukrainian troops to retreat quickly, leaving behind the commander and other badly injured soldiers. \n“Lots of good guys were killed,” said Ms. Chornohuz, 29. “We didn’t have the time to say goodbye to any of them.” \nAfter she reached safety in a village away from the combat zone, she poured her emotions into a poem, typing out verses on her phone. \nEvery time you want to be wrong   \nAbout the brightness of those eyes   \nThe eyes of those who decided one day   \nTo die in battle   \nAre always brighter than others’ \nA year later, Ms. Chornohuz sent the poem and others written on the battlefield to a publisher, \nAn open-mic poetry reading for beginners last month at a bookstore in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. \n# \nA safety adviser for Reuters was missing and two journalists were wounded in the strike.

Over the last two years, poets have emerged as some of the nation’s most popular voices, their verse capturing the raw emotions of the conflict and resonating deeply with a warweary population. \nSales of poetry books have soared, according to bookshop owners. Ye, a large Ukrainian bookstore chain, reported selling 2.5 times more contemporary poetry books in the first year of the war than in 2021. To meet the surge in demand, major Ukrainian publishing houses like Vivat and Nash Format said they had Continued on Page A8 \n# \n# \nIsrael and Hezbollah Claim Victories of Sorts \n# \nJERUSALEM — For weeks, Israelis have waited in trepidation for a major attack by Hezbollah in retaliation for Israel’s assassination of a senior commander of the Lebanese group in Beirut last month, amid widespread fears that a crossborder escalation could spiral into an all-out regional war. \nBut much of Israel woke up on Sunday to find that at least for the immediate term, the longdreaded attack appeared to be over almost before it started. \nBoth Israel and Hezbollah quickly claimed victories of sorts: Israel for its predawn pre-emptive strikes against what the military said were thousands of Hezbollah’s rocket launcher barrels in southern Lebanon; and Hezbollah for its subsequent firing of barrages of rockets and drones at northern Israel, which the Israeli military said killed a naval officer. \nBy breakfast time, the two sides were employing the language of containment. \nHezbollah announced that it had completed the “first stage” o its attack to avenge the assassination of the senior commander, Fuad Shukr, and appeared to be calling it a day, at least for now. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said he had spoken with the U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, and they had “discussed the importance of avoiding regional escalation,” according to a statement from Mr. Gallant’s office. \nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech on Sunday evening that his group had attacked an Israeli intelligence base, Glilot, just north of Tel Aviv. If the results of the attack on the base turned out to be satisfactory, he said, the militia would rest its case. \nIf it turned out to be a failure, he added, then Hezbollah reserved the right to respond at a later date. \nAfter the attacks, the Middle East remained on edge, the days ahead uncertain. \n“There can be stages,” cautioned Ehud Yaari, an Israelbased fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research group. “You can have escalation that is gradual.” \nLater Sunday morning, the Israeli military said it was continuing to strike Hezbollah launchers in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah is estimated to possess tens of thousands of rockets \nContinued on Page A7 \nFLARE-UP, THEN A PAUSE \nFears Grow That Conflict With Lebanon Could Spread in Region \nThis article is by Aaron Boxerman, Isabel Kershner and Euan Ward. \nJERUSALEM — Amid fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, the two sides on Sunday mounted the biggest round of cross-border strikes since the war in Gaza began, with Israel bombing dozens of sites in a pre-emptive attack, and Hezbollah launching hundreds of rockets and drones. \nWithin hours, both sides appeared to de-escalate, at least temporarily, but signaled that the violence and dangerous tensions could continue. Hezbollah said its operation, vengeance for the Israeli assassination of a senior commander, had “finished for the day” but left open the possibility of further action. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that “what happened today is not the final word.” \nFor weeks, Israelis have waited in trepidation for a major attack promised by Hezbollah in retaliation for the airstrike last month in a suburb of Beirut that killed one of its leaders, Fuad Shukr. Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, has also promised retribution for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader, on a visit to Tehran, hours after Mr. Shukr was killed, though it appears to have put that plan on hold. \nA Hezbollah drone was intercepted on Sunday by Israel. \n\nAfter the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah began firing frequently on Israel, prompting widespread Israeli bombardment.

They are trapped in a byzantine drug regulatory process at the World Health Organization. \nThree years after the last worldwide mpox outbreak, the W.H.O. still has not officially approved the vaccines — although the United States and Europe have — nor has it issued an emergency use license that would speed access. One of these two approvals is necessary for UNICEF and Gavi, the organization that helps facilitate immunizations in developing nations, to buy and distribute mpox vaccines in low-income countries like Congo. \n\nWhile high-income nations rely on their own drug regulators, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, many low- and middle-income countries depend on the W.H.O. to judge what vaccines and treatments are safe and effective, a process called prequalification. \nBut the organization is painfully risk-averse, concerned with a Continued on Page A6 \n\n# \nHeat Kills.
