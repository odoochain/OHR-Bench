Trump and several top aides gathered for a quick dinner in a suite atop his hotel in Las Vegas before he descended and declared victory. \nBut the Republican billionaire at the center of attention during the meal was not Mr. Trump — it was Dr. Miriam Adelson. \nThe former president, by then on a glide path to the Republican \n# \nnomination, wanted financial support from Dr. Adelson, a conservative megadonor, and she had a request or two. Be less bombastic, she told him, and speak more directly about the economy. But more important, she made clear to Mr. Trump and his top aides, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, be patient. \nShe would not donate to him while Nikki Haley, his last rival standing and a friend of hers, remained in the race, according to two people briefed on the meeting who insisted on anonymity to describe a private gathering. \nBut once the primary was over? She gave Mr. Trump a renewed assurance that the famous Adelson geyser of cash — which had shot out hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade — would erupt again. \nt would have been uncouth tha Continued on Page A15 \n\n# \nYou can find a great slice all across America, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns, includng, clockwise from top left, Baltimore; Philadelphia; Ava, $\\operatorname{Ill}.;$ and Juneau, Alaska.

Older men, shirts undone, lying down with their eyes closed. Aid tents packed with the unconscious. And lines of the faithful — whether they seek religion, music, ballot boxes or sport — sweating under slivers of shade. \nEven as heat kills more people today than any other extreme weather event, there is still a dangerous cultural lag. Many major-event organizers and attendees are still behind the climate curve, failing to contend with just how much a warming planet has elevated the risk to summer crowds. \nThe consequences have been dire. At this year’s hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, at least 1,300 people died as temperatures surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. And in many ways, that heavy toll was just the latest sign that crowd control and heat waves fueled by climate change are on a dangerous collision course. \nDuring India’s recent election, dozens of poll workers died on the job. Last summer, troops of Boy Scouts visiting South Korea for a jubilee became sick from heat, as did others at music festivals in Australia, Europe and North America. \n“As the warm seasons get longer, as the heat waves come earlier, we’re going to have to adapt,” said Benjamin Zaitchik, a climate scientist at Johns HopContinued on Page A9 \n# \nBy VALERIE HOPKINS They wrote and staged their play as an indictment of terrorism, examining the deception and depravity of violent extremists and the people whose lives they ruin. \nBut now the two women behind the production of “Finist the \n# \nBrave Falcon” are standing trial in a Moscow courtroom, charged with justifying the kind of acts they meant to condemn. \nThe director, Yevgenia Berkovich, 39, and the playwright, Svetlana Petriychuk, 44, two highly decorated fixtures of contemporary Russian theater, have been in custody for more than a year.

Cultural figures supporting the women say this is the first time in Russia’s post-Soviet era that a work of art is effectively being put on trial. The prosecution has been condemned by some of Russia’s best known intellectuals, including the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitri A.

At least five people were fatally shot and 31 others wounded, according to Amnesty International and several prominent Kenyan civic organizations. The toll could not be immediately confirmed. The independent Kenya Human Rights Commission posted a video that showed police officers firing as protesters marched toward them. As tear gas wafted through the streets, some protesters climbed through the windows of Parliament after lawmakers voted 195 to 106 in favor of the tax bill on Tuesday, with supporters saying it would raise revenue for education and other essential services. \nKenya’s president, William Ruto, said he was deploying the military to crack down on what he called “treasonous events.” In a televised address on Tuesday night, Mr. Ruto said the debate about the tax bill had been “hijacked by dangerous people who have caused us the kind of loss we have incurred as a nation today.” \nHe vowed to punish those he said were responsible. “It is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives and the institutions established under our Constitution and expect to go scotfree,” Mr. Ruto added. \nThe defense minister, Aden Duale, said the defense forces had been deployed to support the police, who he said were responding to the “security emergency” caused by the protests, which spread to other Kenyan cities. \nThe turmoil over the finance bill has shaken Kenya, an East African economic powerhouse of 54 million people that has long been an anchor of stability in a tumultuous region. Last week, at least one person was killed and 200 others wounded in protests across the country, according to Amnesty International. \nThe protests convulsed Kenya just as 400 Kenyan police officers were arriving in Haiti as part of an international effort to try to restore order to that country, which has been ravaged by gang violence. \nContinued on Page A5 \nTop Court’s 9-0 Decision Could Break Up His Coalition Cabinet \n# \nJERUSALEM — Israel’s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, a decision that threatened to split Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government amid the war in Gaza. \nIn a unanimous decision, a panel of nine judges held that there was no legal basis for the longstanding military exemption given to ultra-Orthodox religious students. Without a law distinguishing between seminarians and other men of draft age, the court ruled, the country’s mandatory draft laws must similarly apply to the ultra-Orthodox minority. \n# \nIn a country where military service is compulsory for most Jewish Israelis, both men and women, the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox has long prompted resentment. But anger over the group’s special treatment has grown as the war in Gaza has stretched into its ninth month, requiring tens of thousands of reservists to serve multiple tours and costing the lives of hundreds of soldiers. \n“These days, in the midst of a difficult war, the burden of that inequality is more acute than ever — and requires the advancement of a sustainable solution to this issue,” the Supreme Court said in its ruling. \nThe decision threatened to widen one of the most painful divisions in Israeli society, pitting secular Jews against the ultra-Orthodox, who say their religious study is as essential and protective as the military. It also exposed the fault lines in Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, which depends on the support of two ultra-Orthodox parties that oppose their constituents’ \nContinued on Page A6 \n\nTSAFRIR ABAYOV/ASSOCIATED PRESS An Israeli tank near the border with Gaza in early June. \n# \n# \nAround a quarter of the people she sees in her small clinic in Wyoming County would benefit from the weight-loss medications, which also include Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro, she says.
