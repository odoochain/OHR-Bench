One Friday last month, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, spent a chunk of his day in court securing a protective order. \nIt was not his first. Mr. Raskin, who played a leading role in Donald J. Trump’s second impeachment hearing, said he received about 50 menacing calls, emails and letters every month that are turned over to the Capitol Police. His latest court visit was prompted by a man who showed up at his house and screamed in his face about the Covid-19 vaccine, Mr. Trump’s impeachment and gender-related surgeries. Nearly two years earlier, the same man, with his 3-year-old son in his arms, had yelled profanities at Mr. Raskin at a July 4 parade, according to a police report. \n“I told the judge I don’t care about him getting jail time. He just needs some parenting lessons,” Mr. Raskin said. \nMr. Raskin was far from the only government official staring down the uglier side of public service in America in recent weeks. Since late March, bomb threats closed libraries in Durham, N.C.; Reading, Mass.; and Lancaster, Pa., and suspended operations at a courthouse in Franklin County, Pa. In Bakersfield, Calif., an activist protesting the war in Gaza was arrested after telling City Council members: “We’ll see you at your house. We’ll murder you.” \nA Florida man was sentenced to 14 months in prison for leaving a voice mail message promising to \n# \n“come kill” Chief Justice John Roberts. \nAnd Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, refused to rule out violence if he were to lose in November. “It always depends on the fairness of the election,” he said in an interview late last month. \nThis was just a typical month in American public life, where a steady undercurrent of violence and physical risk has become a new normal. From City Hall to Congress, public officials increasingly describe threats and harassment as a routine part of their jobs. Often masked by online anonymity and propelled by extreme political views, the barrage of menace has changed how public officials do their work, terrified their families and driven some from public life altogether. \n\nBy almost all measures, the evi  \ndence of the trend is striking. Last   \nyear, more than 450 federal judges   \nwere targeted with threats, a   \nroughly 150 percent increase from Continued on Page A14 \nEMILY NAJERA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nJOE CHIMENTI, former chairman of the board of supervisors in Shasta County, Calif. Tired of threats, he did not run for a second term. \n# \n# \nATLANTA — President Biden invoked Scripture and lessons from his own tragic past on Sunday in a commencement address to hundreds of young Black men at Morehouse College, saying he believes there are “extremist forces aligned against the meaning and message” of the prestigious institution. \nMr. Biden’s speech, delivered at the historically Black men’s college in Atlanta, put him directly in front of hundreds who represent a slice of the electorate that is drifting away from him over the war in Gaza and growing apathy about their choices ahead of the election. Mr. Biden used the moment to say that manhood was not about “tough talk” and “bigotry” but about calling out hate. \n“Their idea of being a man is toxic,” Mr. Biden told the graduates, a reference to adversaries he did not name — but, given that his other events this weekend were focused on attacking his Republican competitor, Donald J. Trump, it was little mystery who he was talking about. “That is not you. That is not us. Being a man is about strength and respect and dignity.” \nThose who stormed the Capitol with Confederate flags “are called patriots by some,” he said — a clear reference to Mr. Trump. “Not Continued on Page A13 \n# \nRescue Effort Slowed by Bad Conditions \n# \nA helicopter carrying President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday in the country’s mountainous northwest, according to state media, deepening the turmoil that has gripped the nation on both the international and domestic fronts in recent months. \nSearch and rescue teams scoured an area of tall mountains and dense forest through rain and fog for more than 10 hours. At one point the authorities called off the aerial search because of the weather, dispatching on foot soldiers, elite commandos of the Revolutionary Guards and 40 rescue teams to locate the crash site. \nMr. Raisi, 63, was traveling from Iran’s border with Azerbaijan to inaugurate a joint dam project. The helicopter, carrying Mr. Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, state media reported, crashed near the city of Varzaghan around 1 p.m. local time, in bad weather and thick fog. \nEven well into the night, state media had not yet reported on casualties, or on the condition of the president or anyone else aboard. The cause of the crash was also unknown. \n“There will be no disruption in the country’s operation,” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on state TV. “Senior officials are doing their work and I have advised them on the necessary points and all of the country’s operation will carry on smoothly and orderly.” \nMr. Raisi, a conservative who violently crushed dissent, is widely viewed as a possible successor to the supreme leader. The uncertainty over his fate comes during a particularly tumultuous period for Iran. \n\nIts long shadow war with Israel burst into the open after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, setting off the war in Gaza and a cascade of strikes and counterstrikes across the region. \nThe hostilities became even more pronounced after Israel conducted airstrikes on a building in the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria in April. Iran retaliated with its first direct attack on Israel after decades of enmity, launching more than 300 drones and missiles toward the country, many of which were shot down. \nDomestically, Iran is also facing widespread anger, with many residents calling for an end to clerical rule. Corruption and sanctions have gutted the economy, stoking frustrations. \nIn the last two years, the country has witnessed a domestic uprising, the Iranian currency \nContinued on Page A8 \nOFFICE OF THE IRANIAN PRESIDENCY President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran, a conservative leader. \n\n# \n# \nOver the course of a monthlong criminal trial, the evidence against Donald J. Trump has piled up. \nA recording of his voice directing a fixer to pay in cash. Phone \ncalls, text mesNEWS sages, emails and a ANALYSIS photograph that illustrate the case against him. And a parade of 18 witnesses who together told the prosecution’s story: that Mr. Trump orchestrated a conspiracy to suppress sex scandals during the 2016 election, and after winning, sought to bury a porn star’s story for good. \n\nBut the 19th and final witness of their case — the only one to directly link Mr. Trump to the 34 business records he is charged with falsifying — is Michael D. Cohen. And for prosecutors, he was always high-reward, highrisk. Though Mr. Cohen got off to a strong start, Mr. Trump’s lawyer eventually hammered his credibility, highlighting his criminal record and painting him as a serial liar bent on taking down the former president. It was the most significant momentum swing of the first criminal trial of an American president — and with Mr. Cohen’s star turn on the stand poised to conclude on Monday, the prosecution’s case would seem to hang in the balance. Mr. Trump’s legal team argues that it Continued on Page A18 \n\n\n# \n# \nIt is a tale as old as Adam and Eve: A husband, faced with accusations of misconduct, blames the wife. \nIt is also a time-honored, bipartisan political strategy. Last week, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey pointed ringed fingers at their wives for episodes that have landed each man in political or legal trouble. \n“It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito,” Justice Alito, one of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members, told The New York Times in explaining an upsidedown American flag — a “Stop the Steal” symbol of protest by Donald J. Trump’s supporters — flying on a pole in the family’s front lawn in the days before President Biden’s 2021 inauguration. The justice’s wife, Martha-Ann Alito, was in a feud with neighbors at the time over an anti-Trump sign, The Times reported. \n\nIn the case of Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, it was his lawyer who did the finger pointing.
