The sister-in-law who, through the fog of tragedy and drug abuse, ended up an ex-girlfriend. \nOnce inside the courtroom, they locked their eyes past the many strangers who watched them — people who wondered if they would break down, or say the wrong thing. If they would cry. \nHunter Biden is the one on criminal trial, staring down gun charges. But the spectacle in the courtroom has forced the Biden women into an uncomfortable spotlight. \nIn the family, public life has often revolved around the men. The women called to testify had, at different points, tried to support and protect the one who was the troubled husband, father and son — and whose ruinous history of addiction continues to hit them with shrapnel. The women who didn’t speak sat in the courtroom, playing parts of nurturers and sentinels. \nThe pain of this responsibility was written on the face of Hunter Biden’s eldest daughter, Naomi Biden Neal, who testified on his behalf on Friday. \n“He seemed great,” a nervoussounding Ms. Biden Neal, dressed in black with her hair pulled back, told the court on Friday. “He seemed hopeful.” \nMs. Biden Neal, 30, was describing a period in October 2018 when drug addiction was again overtaking her father’s life. That month, Hunter Biden had bought a gun and filled out a federal form attesting that he was not using drugs — a decision that is at the heart of the prosecution’s case against him. \nMs. Biden Neal had to revis Continued on Page A13 \n# \n# \nTran Dang sued the makers of the Netflix dating series “Love Is Blind” over allegations of “false imprisonment,” saying it confined her and the rest of the cast to hotel rooms without their phones. She also accused a fellow cast member of groping her and exposing himself. \nBravo’s “Real Housewives” universe has inspired a string of lawsuits, as the drama and battles have moved from TV screens to social media to tabloids to court dockets. Caroline Manzo, who had signed on to appear in a spinoff, accused the companies behind the show of failing to intervene when a co-star forcibly groped and kissed her during filming, and charged that they “regularly ply the Real Housewives cast with alcohol, cause them to become severely intoxicated” and then encourage or allow them to “sexually harass other cast members because that is good for ratings.” \nAnd Faith Stowers, a former member of the cast of “Vanderpump Rules,” a spinoff of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” sued the companies behind the show, claiming that after she had reported instances of racism, harassment and another cast member brandishing a knife at \n# \n\n# \n# \nKHERSON CITY, Ukraine — As news of Russia’s invasion spread through Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Dr. Natalia Lukina was waiting for a taxi at her home. \nBy the time she arrived, the rumble of artillery fired by Russian troops advancing on Kherson City, the region’s capital, was already reverberating through the hallways. The doctor and her fellow caregivers faced a wrenching dilemma: how to protect the dozens of vulnerable children. \nIt was 6 a.m., and she was eager to get to work at Kherson Children’s Home, a state-run foster home for institutionalized children with special needs, where she served as a doctor. \nThey were all infants and toddlers, and some had serious disabilities, such as cerebral palsy. Some had living parents who retained limited custody over them, while others had been re\n“Who else would have stayed behind to look after them?” Dr. Lukina said about her decision to remain with the children. “Imagine if we all turned our backs and left?” \nOlena Korniyenko, the director of the foster home and the children’s legal guardian, had prepared emergency bags for the children two weeks earlier, and she had stocked the home with boxes of food, water and diapers. \nBut the building was not equipped to withstand gunfire or shelling, and the police had already fled the city. When Ms. Korniyenko called the police chief to ask about using their underground bunker just 300 yards away, he warned her that the station would become a military target. \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \n# \nPressure Mounts After Cabinet Shake-Up \n# \nJERUSALEM — For months, Israelis had heard only about hostages being killed or declared dead in Gaza. The “lucky” families were those whose loved ones’ remains were retrieved by soldiers, at great risk, and brought home to Israel for burial So the audacious rescue on Saturday of four living hostages instantly raised morale in Israel and offered at least a momentary victory for the country’s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \nBut by Sunday, euphoria was already giving way to a harsher reality. The heavy air and ground assault that accompanied the rescue killed scores of Palestinians, including civilians, according to Gaza health officials, puncturing Israel’s claims that the operation was a resounding success, at least internationally. And the operation failed to resolve any of the deep dilemmas and challenges vexing the Israeli government, according to analysts. \nEight months into its grinding war in Gaza, Israel still appears to be far from achieving its stated objectives of dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. And Israelis fear that time is running out for many of the hostages in Gaza. About a third of the 120 that remain have already been declared dead by Israeli authorities. \nAt the same time, Israel’s leadership is grappling with an escalation of hostilities across the northern border with Lebanon and battling increasing international isolation and opprobrium over the war in Gaza, including allegations of genocide that are being heard by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. \nThe rescue mission “doesn’t solve a single one of the problems that Israel has been facing ever since Oct. 7,” Nahum Barnea, a leading Israeli politica columnist, wrote in the popular \nYediot Ahronot newspaper on Sunday. \nThe decision on Sunday of Benny Gantz, a former military chief and Mr. Netanyahu’s main political rival, to pull his centrist National Unity party out of the emergency wartime cabinet left Mr. Netanyahu even more exposed. \n“It doesn’t solve the problem in the north; it doesn’t solve the problem in Gaza; and it doesn’t solve the slew of other problems that threaten Israel in the international arena,” he added. \nThe stability of Mr. Netanyahu’s government now appears to be hanging in the balance. \n\nNIR ELIAS/REUTERS Benny Gantz quit Israel’s emergency government. \nPressure has been building on the Israeli government to reach a deal with Hamas for the release of all the remaining hostages. But the fate of Israel’s proposal for a truce and a hostage and prisoner swap, as outlined by President Biden more than a week ago, is still uncertain. The Biden administration and Israeli officials say they are still awaiting a formal response from Hamas to determine whether negotiations can resume. \nIsraelis are now debating whether the hostage rescue operation will help or hinder the prospects for such a deal — one \nContinued on Page A8 \n# \n# \nSAN JUAN, P.R. — Feral cats have roamed the blue cobblestone streets of Old San Juan for as long as anyone can remember.
