The three confidants are part of an echo chamber where dissent is rare. \n# \nLawsuits Describe Leaders Rejecting Pleas From Employees for Safeguards \n# \nIn April 2019, David Ginsberg, a Meta executive, emailed his boss, Mark Zuckerberg, with a proposal to research and reduce loneliness and compulsive use on Instagram and Facebook. \nIn the email, Mr. Ginsberg noted that the company faced scrutiny for its products’ influence “especially around areas of problematic use/addiction and teens.” He asked Mr. Zuckerberg for 24 engineers, researchers and other staff, saying Instagram had a “deficit” on such issues. \nA week later, Susan Li, now the company’s chief financial officer, informed Mr. Ginsberg that the project was “not funded” because of staffing constraints. \nThe email exchanges are just one slice of evidence cited among more than a dozen lawsuits filed since last year by the attorneys general of 45 states and the District of Columbia. The states accuse Meta of unfairly ensnaring teenagers and children on Instagram and Facebook while deceiving the public about the hazards. Using a coordinated legal approach reminiscent of the government’s pursuit of Big Tobacco in the 1990s, the attorneys general seek to compel Meta to bolster protections for minors. \nAdam Mosseri, Instagram’s head, ultimately declined to finance the project, too, writing in an email: “Unfortunately I don’t see us funding this from Instagram any time soon.” \nA New York Times analysis of the states’ court filings — including roughly 1,400 pages of company documents and correspondence filed as evidence by the State of Tennessee — shows how Mr. Zuckerberg and other Meta leaders repeatedly promoted the safety of the company’s platforms, playing down risks to young people, even as they rejected employee pleas to bolster youth guardrails and hire additional staff. \n\nIn interviews, the attorneys general of several states suing Meta said Mr. Zuckerberg had led his company to drive user engagement at the expense of child welfare. \n“A lot of these decisions ultimately landed on Mr. Zuckerberg’s desk,” said Raúl Torrez, the attorney general of New Mexico. “He needs to be asked explicitly, and held to account explicitly, for the decisions that he’s made.” \nHis warning could boost momentum in Congress to pass the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill that would require social media com\nThe state lawsuits against Meta reflect mounting concerns that teenagers and children on social media can be sexually solicited, harassed, bullied, body-shamed and algorithmically induced into compulsive online use. Last Monday, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, called for warning labels to be placed on social networks, saying the platforms present a public health risk to young people. \nContinued on Page A12 \n# \n# \n“What’s your instinct? What do you think?” Mr. Biden will ask Mr. Donilon, who recently left the White House for the campaign’s Delaware headquarters. \nOnce a week, Mr. Biden summons Ron Klain, his former chief of staff, to workshop the best at\nWASHINGTON — Multiple times each day, President Biden dials up Mike Donilon, a close adviser since the 1980s, to chew on the latest polls and headlines. \nIt was Mr. Kaufman who was brutally direct with Mr. Biden when a plagiarism scandal threatened his first campaign for president in 1987. \ntacks to use against former President Donald J. Trump as the presidential debate draws closer. \nWhen he leaves for Delaware on weekends, Mr. Biden seeks out Ted Kaufman, a confidant who represents the president’s ties to the state that introduced him to the national stage more than a half-century ago. \n“There’s only one way to stop the sharks,” Mr. Kaufman told him \nInterviews with dozens of people close to the president reveal a truth at the heart of Mr. Biden’s political life: While he is surrounded by a diverse and multigenerational crowd of campaign operatives, policy experts and cabinet secretaries, he reserves his full trust for a small circle of insiders who are the definition of old school. \nat the time, “and that’s pull out.” Mr. Biden did. \nThe three are at the center of the Biden world, part of an echo chamber where dissent is rare. In important moments, each has told the president news he did not want to hear, although not one of them said no when the president was considering whether to run for a second term. They are also decades older than the young voters who could decide the election, which worries many of the president’s allies. \n\nMr. Klain is the youngest at 62. Mr. Donilon is 65. Mr. Kaufman is 85, four years older than Mr. Biden. Each has earned the president’s trust over not just years but decades.

The show, which follows real couples in the New York area as they undergo about five months of therapy, had become a conduit for having difficult conversations about their own relationship. Perez hoped that being selected for the show could help them even more. Months later, Perez and his fiancée, Natasha Marks, sat on a couch inside a soundstage in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Greenpoint. Across from them, on a TV set built to look like a therapist’s office, was Orna Guralnik, the psychoanalyst and therapeutic maestro of “Couples Therapy.” \n\nPARAMOUNT+ WITH SHOWTIME \nosh Perez and Natasha Marks signed up for “Couples Therapy” after watching the show at home. \n“I guess if I was to sum up why we’re here,” Marks said, searching Perez’s face as she spoke, “we just recently had a little baby boy, and our emotional and physical intimacy, for a while, has taken a tank.” \nAcross the show’s four seasons — the latest was recently released on Paramount Plus with Showtime $^{\\mathrm{~-~a~}}$ total of 20 couples and one polyamorous trio have revealed the kind of intimacies that Marks shared for the dissection of Guralnik and, by extension, a national TV audience. Online, the show has an active fandom that probes its relationships as if trading gossip inside a friend group. The attention has left most of the show’s couples grappling with both anticipated and unexpected consequences of televised therapy. \n\n\nIn interviews with six couples who appeared across the first three seasons, many said the prospect of 20 free hourlong sessions with a therapist whose work they could preview on television was a main draw. Before they applied for the show, India Browne \n\nContinued on Page A11 \n# \n# \nIn 2021, retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Donald J. Trump’s first national security adviser, became chairman of a 75-year-old nonprofit organization — the kind of small charity where chairmen typically work for free. \nBut Mr. Flynn received a salary of \\$40,000, for working two hours per week. \nThe next year, he got a raise: \\$60,000, for two hours. \nMr. Flynn’s charity also paid one of his brothers, two of his sisters, his niece and his sister-inlaw. By the end of its second year, his nonprofit group, America’s Future Inc., was running in the red, burning through reserves — and still paying \\$518,000, or 29 percent of its budget, to Flynns. \nSince leaving the Trump administration under an ethical cloud, Michael Flynn has converted his Trump-world celebrity into a lucrative and sprawling family business. He and his relatives have marketed the retired general as a martyr, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for a legal-defense fund and then pocketing leftover money. Through a network of nonprofit and for-profit ventures, they have sold far-right conspiracy theories, ranging from lies about the 2020 election to warnings, embraced by followers of QAnon, about cabals of pedophiles and child traffickers. \n“This is one that goes up to the highest levels of corporations, up to the highest levels of the government,” Mr. Flynn said recently at a meeting hosted by America’s Future in Kent, Ohio. “People that you know and that you think you respect.” \nA New York Times investigation found Flynn family members had made at least \\$2.2 million Continued on Page A15 \n\nAVISHAG SHAAR-YASHUV FOR THE NYT Israelis lit candles outside the tomb of the revered sage Baba Sali in Netivot in April. \n# \n# \nMichael Zigdon, who operates a small food shack in Netivot’s rundown market and had employed two men from Gaza until the attack, expressed little sympathy for Gazans, who have endured a ferocious Israeli military onslaught for the past eight months. “Who wants this war and who doesn’t?” Mr. Zigdon said, while mopping up red food dye that had spilled from a crushed-ice drink machine in his shack. “It wasn’t us who attacked them on Oct. 7.” \nNETIVOT, Israel — The southern Israeli city of Netivot, a working-class hub for mystical rabbis about 10 miles from the Gaza border, escaped the worst of the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, a fluke many residents ascribe to miraculous intervention by the Jewish sages buried here. \nNevertheless, many here seem to show little concern about the suffering now of the Palestinian civilians — practically neighbors — across the fence in Gaza. \nLike many Israelis, Mr. Zigdon blamed Hamas for embedding itself in residential areas, endan\nContinued on Page A6 \n\n# \nArchitect of Today’s Singapore Focusing on community and light, Liu Thai Ker replaced slums with spacious high-rises.
