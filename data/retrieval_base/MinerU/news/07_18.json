Fahrenthold, Glenn Thrush, Campbell Robertson, Adam Goldman and Aric Toler. \nWASHINGTON — About an hour before a gunman let loose a volley of bullets that nearly assassinated a former president, the law enforcement contingent in Butler, Pa., was on the verge of a great policing success. \nIn a sea of thousands of people streaming in to cheer former President Donald J. Trump at a campaign rally on Saturday, local officers spotted one skinny young man acting oddly and notified other law enforcement. The Secret Service, too, was informed, through radio communication. The suspicious man did not appear to have a weapon. \nRemarkably, law enforcement had found the right man — Thomas Matthew Crooks, a would-be assassin, though officers did not know that at the time. Then they lost track of him. \nTwenty minutes before violence erupted, a sniper, from a distance, spotted Mr. Crooks again and took his picture. \nAs time slipped away, at least two local officers were pulled from traffic detail to help search for the man. But the Secret Service, the agency charged with protecting Mr. Trump, did not stop him from taking the stage. Eight minutes after Mr. Trump started to speak, Mr. Crooks fired off bullets that left the Republican presidential nominee bloodied and a rally visitor dead. \nThe call to let the proceedings go on as planned while law enforcement looked for a suspicious person is one of many Secret Service agency decisions that are now being called into question as new information continues to be revealed. The agency is also under fire for allowing a building within a rifle’s range to be excluded from its secure perimeter, creating a blind spot close to the former president that the gunman exploited. \nContinued on Page A15 \nON THE SPOT The assassination attempt puts the Secret Service chief’s job in jeopardy.

If your child one day faces cancer, diabetes or even autism, the precious stem cells in the cord blood could become a tailor-made cure. \nMany families are happy to pay for the assurance of a healthy future. More than two million umbilical cord samples sit in a handful of suburban warehouses across the country. It’s a lucrative business, with companies charging several thousand dollars upfront plus hundreds more every year \n# \nthereafter. The industry has grown rapidly, bolstered by investments from medical device companies, hospital partnerships and endorsements from celebrities like Drew Barrymore and Chrissy Teigen. \nBut the leading banks have consistently misled customers and doctors about the technology’s promise, an investigation by The New York Times found. Doctors rarely use cord blood anymore, thanks to advances that have made it easier to transplant adult stem cells. And the few parents who try to withdraw cord blood samples often find that they are unusable — either because their volume is too low or they have been contaminated with microbes. \n\nWhen the first cord blood banks opened three decades ago, doctors were optimistic about turning the stem cells, otherwise discarded as medical waste, into a powerful new treatment for patients with leukemia and other blood disorders. Private banks promised peace of mind for anxious parents-to-be, knowing the cells would be ready and waiting if their child ever got sick. \nContinued on Page A19 \nenna Edwards was still charged for years after her son’s cord blood was found to be contaminated. \nEVA MARIE UZCATEGUI FOR THE NEW YORK TIME \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — On June 20, after millions of Americans had suffered through a sweltering heat wave for three days, Amtrak sent an ominous warning over social media: Trains connecting the largest cities in Northeast could face up to an hour of delay from high temperatures. \nLater that afternoon, after the temperature peaked at 96 degrees in Newark, Amtrak lost electricity near the New Jersey side of the \n# \n\nHudson River tunnels. The power failure soon shuttered a 150-mile stretch of the busiest rail corridor in the United States for more than three hours. The impact reverberated until the next day, when trains chugged through with hours of residual delays. As the planet rapidly warms, \nA New York Times analysis of Amtrak data found that the rail service’s passengers have faced record delays in recent years caused by inclement weather such as heat waves, storms, Continued on Page A20 \ntrain delays and breakdowns are becoming more frequent as America’s antiquated rail infrastructure struggles to remain functional during prolonged extreme weather events that were not typical when the system was constructed. \n# \nFormer Critic Spent Years Winning Favor \n# \nThe meeting got off to a bad start. \nexactly the people Mr. Vance purported to represent. \nJ.D. Vance walked into Donald J. Trump’s office at Mar-a-Lago on a warm winter afternoon in February 2021. The former president had a thick stack of papers on his desk: printouts of Mr. Vance’s copious broadsides against Mr. Trump. Mr. Vance’s past criticisms had included an essay in one of Mr. Trump’s least favorite magazines, The Atlantic, where Mr. Vance described Mr. Trump as “cultural heroin” — a purveyor of false promises to the white working class. \nMr. Trump, using an expletive, bluntly told Mr. Vance: You said some nasty stuff about me. The discussion that followed was described in detail by two people with knowledge of the meeting who insisted on anonymity to talk about a private conversation. \nMr. Vance’s next move was crucial. This was the first time he was meeting Mr. Trump, and Mr. Vance needed the former president to like him or at least leave the meeting with an open mind. Mr. Vance — the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” a best-selling memoir about his troubled upbringing and the struggles and pathologies of the white working class — was running for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican populist, a Never Trumper turned proTrumper. \nMr. Trump agreed, telling Mr. Vance that he should have understood because Mr. Vance had written the “Hillbilly Elegy” book. His implication was that Mr. Vance should have supported him because Mr. Trump’s own base of non-college-educated voters angry about globalization, immigration and foreign wars comprised \nMr. Vance decided to immediately apologize. He told Mr. Trump that he had bought into what he described as media lies and that he was sorry he got it wrong. Of all people, Mr. Vance told Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance himself should have understood. \nAt that point, Mr. Trump seemed disarmed, and the meeting went on for almost two hours. They discussed the 2020 election and the Ohio race, but mostly they talked about the difficulties of politics. It had been less than a month since Mr. Trump left the White House a pariah, in the wake of a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol after the president had spent two months lying about a stolen election. \nMr. Vance, who along with a spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment for this article, told the former president he wasn’t going to do that. \nMr. Trump closed the conversation by asking Mr. Vance what he wanted. Mr. Trump told him that everyone else had already been down to Mar-a-Lago begging for his endorsement — a reference to Mr. Vance’s potential opponents in the Ohio Senate primary. \nMr. Trump, surprised, asked Mr. Vance if he wanted the endorsement. Mr. Vance said that of course he wanted it, but that Mr. Trump Continued on Page A12 \n\nDOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES ONLINE Donald J. Trump with J.D. Vance.

The maneuver came as Representative Adam B. Schiff of California became the highest-profile Democratic lawmaker to call on Mr. Biden to end his run. \nAfter a brief pause in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump, conversations among Democrats on Capitol Hill and elsewhere about replacing Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket have resumed with vigor. More details have emerged of heated conversations the president has held with lawmakers in which he has angrily pushed back on their entreaties for him to drop out of the race. \nMr. Biden’s disastrous debate performance last month, his uneven public appearances and his struggles in the polls have fueled deep worries within his party.

A Democrat in a Republican stronghold, he had campaigned on consensus. \n“I’ve never seen a Republican or Democratic pothole,” Mr. Dandoy, 71, a retired high school English teacher, would tell voters. “Or a Republican or Democratic playground. Or a Republican or Democratic fire that the fire department needs to put out.” \nHe was at dinner with his family on Saturday when a city councilman texted. One spectator was dead at Donald J. Trump’s campaign rally on the farm show grounds, two more were critically injured. The former president’s right ear had been grazed by a bullet. The gunman, an isolated 20-year-old with an AR-15-style rifle, was fatally shot by the Secret Service. All this in the town of about 13,000 people where Mr. Dandoy has lived “all my life.” \nSince then, national discord has descended on Butler with such force that this week it crashed the town’s website.
