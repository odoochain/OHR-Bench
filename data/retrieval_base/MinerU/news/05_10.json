PAGE A18 \nAbout 20 people attended an April 11 event billed as an “energy round table” at Mr. Trump’s private club, according to those people, who asked not to be identified in order to discuss the private event. Attendees included executives from ExxonMobil, EQT Corporation and the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry. \nHow California Powered Itself in April 2021 … ,… and in April 2024. \nMr. Trump has publicly railed for months against President Biden’s energy and environmental agenda, as Mr. Biden has raced to restore and strengthen dozens of climate and conservation rules that Mr. Trump had weakened or erased while in office. In particular, Mr. Trump has promised to eliminate Mr. Biden’s new climate rules intended to accelerate the nation’s transition to electric vehicles, and to push a “drill, baby, drill” agenda aimed at opening up more public lands to oil and gas exploration. \nThe event was organized by the oil billionaire Harold Hamm, who has for years helped to shape Republican energy policies. It was first reported by The Washington Post. \nCalifornia draws more electricity from the sun than any other state. It also has a timing problem: Solar power is plentiful during the day but disappears by evening, just as people get home from work and electricity demand spikes. To fill the gap, power companies typically burn more fossil fuels like natural gas. \nThis article is by Lisa Friedman, Coral Davenport, Jonathan Swan and Maggie Haberman. \nFormer President Donald J. Trump told a group of oil executives and lobbyists gathered at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort last month that they should donate \\$1 billion to his presidential campaign because, if elected, he would roll back environmental rules that he said hampered their industry, according to two people who were there. \nMr. Biden has called climate change an existential threat and has moved to cut the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet and supercharging storms, heat \n# \nVows to Upend Biden’s Environmental Rules \nContinued on Page A14 \n# \nEven as it has become increasingly clear that the bird flu outbreak on the nation’s dairy farms began months earlier — and is probably much more widespread — than previously thought, federal authorities have emphasized that the virus poses little risk to humans. \nThat leaves the workers and their families vulnerable to a poorly tracked pathogen. And it \nYet there is a group of people who are at high risk for infection: the estimated 100,000 men and women who work on those farms.

Since 2020, California has installed more giant batteries than anywhere in the world apart from China. They can soak up excess solar power during the day and store it for use when it gets dark. Those batteries play a pivotal role in California’s electric grid, partially replacing fossil fuels in the evening. Between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on April 30, for example, batteries supplied more than onefifth of California’s electricity and, poses broader public health risks. If the virus were to find its way into the wider population, experts say, dairy workers would be a likely route. \n\n“We have no idea if this virus is going to evolve to become a pandemic strain, but we know today that farmworkers are being exposed, and we have good reasons to think that they are getting sick,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. \nfor a few minutes, pumped out 7,046 megawatts of electricity, akin to the output from seven large nuclear reactors. \n# \nAcross the country, power companies are increasingly using giant batteries the size of shipping containers to address renewable \n# \n“What’s happening in California is a glimpse of what could happen to other grids in the future,” said Helen Kou, head of U.S. power analysis at BloombergNEF, a research firm. “Batteries are quickly moving from these niche applications to shifting large amounts of renewable Continued on Page A13 \nA majority of dairy farmworkers are Spanish-speaking immigrants, often undocumented, who may not have paid sick leave or be protected by occupational safety laws. They may lack access to medical providers, and their employers can be intolerant of absences. \nenergy’s biggest weakness: the fact that the wind and sun aren’t always available. \n“This sector of workers is not only at the very, very highest risk because they’re having that direct, intimate contact with discharge, raw milk, with infected animals, but they’re also at the very, very highest level of risk in terms of having no social safety net,” said Elizabeth Strater, an organizer with United Farm Workers. \nInterviews with more tha three dozen federal and state offi Continued on Page A19 \n# \nSome people, though, experience loneliness not just transiently but chronically.

Israeli authorities descended on a room used by Al Jazeera in the Ambassador Hotel in East Jerusalem, confiscating broadcast equipment.
