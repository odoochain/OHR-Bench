A master conductor knows not only how to read each measure and phrase, but how to elicit the larger structures, the meaning of the entire work,indeed toforeshadow the senseof thework as a whole within the opening measures. There isno doubt that Rabbi Steinsaltz is such a master conductor,but there is more hemight do to sensitize his readers to the broad perspective he surely possesses. \nTo continue the musical analogy for a moment, Gustav Mahler once said, “The symphony must be like the whole world. It must contain everything\" Rabbi Steinsaltz would probably say the same for theTalmud.Indeed,this seems to be part of theTalmud's attraction forhim:its elusive structure and wide-ranging mode of discourse.But the commentary sticks so closely to the text thatwe getvery little sense of Rabbi Steinsaltz's personal perspective. His dazzling erudition, his playful yet profound style, his impishly penetrating apercus-all of the personal qualities whichmakeaconversationwithhim a genuine intellectual delight-are,for the most part,absent from the commentary,which always stays close to the surface of thetext.Of course,the first duty of acommentaryis to explain, butonewouldhaveliked tosensemore ofSteinsaltzin theSteinsaltzedition. \n\nNone of these quibbles,however, is meant todetractfromtheessential value of Rabbi Steinsaltz's achievement. He has indeed accomplishedwhat he setout todo.HehasmadetheTalmud accessible to us.He hasput it on the topof ourintellectual agenda.Hehas ensured that theTalmudwill once again become a central vehicle of Jewish communication and self-understanding andhas thereby made an inestimable contributiontofosteringtheelusive goal of Jewish unity.He hasreintroduced theTalmud anditsvalues tothe worldofgeneralculture. \nWhatwearetodowiththetools that he has given us is, of course, up to us. As always among Jews, various factions will come along,pulling and tugging at theTalmud, claiming it as their own, claiming that... but wait a moment,doesn'ttheTalmuditselfdiscuss just such a case,with two people arguingaboutanobjectwhich each claims belongs to him alone? Bava Metzia,Chapter One. 口 \nNorman Weinstein \n# \nDerhaps someday an enterprising record store owner will create a place among the shelves for music belonging to a category labeled \"Resistance” I'm imagining a classification wide enough to include Pete Seeger and Shostakovich, Paul Robeson and this soundtrack recording connected to adocumentaryfilm about the Jewish underground inVilna,Lithuania.Such speculationbrought tomind thefleeting hype about“protest music”which filled the media in the early sixties. But “resistance” seems a more hearty, less whiny word to identify with music that defies horror, implying acts that follow cries of protest. \n\nThis music of resistance stirs de fiance in listeners; it does not simply note injustice.The Black spirituals celebrated by W.E. B. Du Bois in Tbe Souls of BlackFolk channeled listener rage through coded instructions.Think of the lyrics to“Follow the Drinking Gourd.\" Such songs made the underground railroad happen,breaking the chains of American slavery through lilting melody and wisely covert travel directions. If the song was moving, it literally moved thousands of slaves north of theMason-Dixon line. \n\nThe songs of Jewish resistance to the Holocaust can beviewed in a like fashion.Manyof thetwelve selections in this outstanding collection are calls to action.“You Jewish Partisan”for example,featuresa traditional Eastern European folk melody (as do most of the minor-mode tunes here)—-but Shmerke Kaczerginski's lyrics are anything but customary:"

Damned if I can begin to guess why Michael Alpert's singing is accompanied by...abalalaika! \n\nThis would make an appropriategift to anyonewhoever bougbt the stereotype of Jews docilely letting theNazislead them to slaugbter \nButmost surprises here arerewarding.Be prepared for a shock when you hear thevoice of theyoungster David J.Waletsky. Thin, nasal, and of questionable pitch in spots,heis nevertheless absolutely winning in his rendition of“Yisrolik,\" a saga ofanorphan turned street peddler. His presence, absolutely unexpected, beguiles with artless sincerity,much like the untrained child singer on the recording of Archie Shepp's “Attica Blues.” He's outstanding becausehe'srobust,reckless,rambunctious,like the adults on this recording, yet with a tinge of overwhelming tragedy lacing his vocals. \nOf the others,let me pay particular homage to the singing of Henry Sapoznik. An edgy urgency inflames his delivery, a grit and spunk which give his songs an unstoppablemomentum.All performers are to be credited, even though Adrienne Cooper's operatic delivery was not always to my liking. \n\nThe programming successfully blends up-tempomartial anthemswith moody and introspective ballads. Every song wears well on repeated listenings. Oneneednotworry that this album is only of documentary value,or needs the video of the accompanying film in order towork. \nPartisansofVilnawould makea highly appropriate gift to anyone who ever bought the stereotype of Jews docilely letting theNazis lead them to slaughter.Historical texts to dissolve the stereotype can be suggested, but how much more dramatically efficacious is this rousing music in setting the historical record straight! \nThis song is written with blood and not with pencil lead, It's no song of a free-flying bird, A people among collapsingwalls Sang this song with pistols in their hands. ——Hirsh Glik,“Never Say” \nThese are musical performances that speak to all souls in all ages and say \"No\"to evil. \n# \n(Continued from p. 5) \nsensitivity to thepain of others,and if itsleaderswere chosen solelyby the extenttowhichtheyembodied these values,there would be a massive return toJudaism.Such a transformation would strengthenthe Jewishcommunity —and far from losing money, the money would come pouring in without all the clever fund-raising techniques and gimmicks. \nIt is in these terms thatwe call the organized Jewishcommunity conformist. The dominant values of material success and taking care of “number one” have been internalized in the AmericanJewish world to the extent that worrying about the poor and the oppressed is frequently dismissed as “not a Jewish issue.” Those who raise these concerns are told that they are \"“always worrying about everybody els's problems except for the Jewsproblems.\"Yet the struggle for social justice isa primary command of Torah-it is aJewishproblem,theJewisbproblem par excellence.To the extent that this has been forgotten, the organized Jewish community is correctly described as conformist—to the selfishness and celebration ofmaterial successthat have dominated American culture in the era of Reagan and now of Bush. \n\nAn important word of caution here. It is not selfish to worry about oneself or one's own survival. We are strong supporters of Zionism.And we reject the kind of leftism that makes people feel guilty if they accumulate money or want to lead a good life, complete with good food, attractive clothes, good music, a nice house,a good car, and so on. There is nothing evil or fundamentally materialistic in those who seek material comforts for themselves. What becomes materialistic is when they make choices to support a system that will provide those benefits only to themselves and not allow for sharing the good life with others. In that sense, there is a moral difference between those who live well but support a liberal agenda that includes economic redistribution and adequate health, safety,housing,and food for those in need, and those who struggle only for their own well-being and turn their backs and close their ears to the cries of the oppressed and the hungry and the homeless. The choice of being on theRight is not a choice like preferring strawberryice cream to vanilla-it is a choice with deep moral implications, and in our estimation it is frequently animmoral choice. \n\nWeatTikkunhavecontinuallycriticized the failings of liberals and progressives,their insensitivity to psychological, spiritual, and ethical concerns, and theirinsensitivity tomanyof theprob"
