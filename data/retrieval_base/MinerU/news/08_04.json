Even more shocking than seeing the book he had toiled for years to create was that the vendor wanted a paltry 5 shekels, or about \\$1, for it. \nThe salesman suggested using the pages for kindling. \n“I was torn between two feelings,” he said, “laughter and bitterness.” \nIn Gaza, even poetry books can become a source of profit for enterprising thieves. A pervasive lawlessness has emerged from the rubble of cities obliterated since Israel launched its all-out offensive on the enclave in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7. \n“Thieves’ markets,” as they are called by locals, have proliferated across Gaza, selling loot plundered from homes, businesses and even hospitals. With Israel blocking the flow of most goods into Gaza, the markets have become important places for finding household necessities. And visits to the markets have become a weary ritual for Gazans seeking to reclaim stolen pieces of their lives. \nSome, like Mr. Al-Jabri, even stumble upon belongings they had not yet realized were missing. \nIn his hometown in southern Gaza, Khan Younis, where the central market was reduced to rubble by Israeli strikes, vendors sell stolen hospital supplies and clothes on plastic tarps or wooden carts alongside produce sellers on the main road out of the battered city. \nIn Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, the bustling trade in stolen goods happens next to the traditional street market. Once a tangled network of streets awash in the smell of spices and the chants of vendors hawking fruit, that \nContinued on Page 10 \nANUWAR HAZARIKA/NURPHOTO, VIA GETTY IMAGES,Some experts say a solar geoengineering intervention to slow rising temperatures could lead to unpredictable calamities. \n# \n# \n# \nCHICAGO — David Keith was a graduate student in 1991 when a volcano erupted in the Philippines, sending a cloud of ash toward the edge of space. Seventeen million tons of sulfur dioxide \n# \nreleased from Mount Pinatubo spread across the stratosphere, reflecting some of the sun’s energy away from Earth. The result was a drop in average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere by roughly one degree Fahrenheit in the year that followed. \nToday, Dr. Keith cites that event as validation of an idea that has become his life’s work: He believes that by intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, it would be possible to lower temperatures worldwide, blunting global warming. \n\nSuch radical interventions are increasingly being taken seriously as the effects of climate change grow more intense. Global temperatures have hit record highs for 13 months in a row, unleashing violent weather, deadly heat waves and raising sea levels. Scientists expect the heat to keep climbing for decades. The main driver of the warming, the burning of fossil fuels, continues more or less unabated. \nAgainst this backdrop, there is growing interest in efforts to intentionally alter the Earth’s climate, a field known as geoengineering. \nAlready, major corporations are operatContinued on Page 18 \nUNLIKELY HOST In Azerbaijan, site of talks on climate change, trade-offs to fight its effects are acutely felt.

When former President Donald J. Trump challenged Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity at a public forum on Wednesday — and again on social media the next day — that was the message at the core of his remarks. \nIt is a tactic that has long been part of the underside of American politics: presenting an opponent as somehow “other” or “not one of us” — someone who cannot be trusted or truly known. \nBut while this has been a recurrent theme in American campaigns for at least a century, Mr. Trump has taken it to a new level, historians and analysts said. What has often been a subtext or a whisper campaign driven by surrogates is, in Mr. Trump’s hands, a central message of his campaign — projected on screens at a rally, promoted on social media and reinforced by his running mate. \nMr. Trump has personally led the effort, explicitly falsifying the biography of his opponent and invoking race and gender in ways no modern major-party leader has done before. Even as a noncandidate in the 2008 election, he deployed such tactics against Barack Obama, demanding to see Mr. Obama’s birth certificate and claiming that Mr. Obama — who went on to be the nation’s first Black president and was born in Hawaii — was not born in this country. \n“Whenever the United States is poised to break a political glass ceiling, we see an intensification of othering in our politics,” said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. “What makes Trump a singularly poisonous political player is that the top of the ticket is overtly engaging in othering against his political opponent.” \nOver decades, the tactic of Continued on Page 16 \nANN WANG/REUTERS \n# \nKatie Ledecky of the U.S. on Saturday tied the women’s Olympic record for career gold medals with her ninth.

But when she scrolled through his photographs, she noticed his amputated leg. \nKYIV, Ukraine — For the past two and a half years, Kateryna Bairachna has wanted to meet someone special. But war always gets in the way. \n“I looked at his profile for 15 minutes and felt so sorry for him,” Ms. Bairachna, 35, a marketing director for a clothing brand in Kyiv, said in an interview. She wondered if she could handle a relationship with a maimed war veteran. Then she swiped left, removing him from potential matches. “I feel I’m not ready for that.” \nRussia’s full-scale invasion has upended nearly every facet of daily life in Ukraine. Two-thirds of \nUkrainians have lost a relative or friend to the conflict. Hourslong blackouts are now routine across the country, and entire cities have been obliterated by Russian strikes. \nIt has also wreaked havoc on the dating scene. While the pursuit of love might seem secondary to dealing with missile attacks, power outages and food shortages, many Ukrainians say they need romantic relationships to help them cope with the trauma of living in a nation at war. \nFor women, the problem is particularly acute. Tens of thousands of men have died. Many more are on the front lines, some have fled the country and others are reluctant to leave their homes, fearful of being stopped in the street by draft officers. In cities like Kyiv, the capital, the presence of men has noticeably dwindled. In some villages, conscription has hollowed out the male population. “This leaves a small percentage \nContinued on Page 12 \n# \n# \nBetter known online as M Beast, Mr. Donaldson, 26, has made a name for himself as a benevolent YouTube star who h racked up hundreds of millions of subscribers for his provocative brand of philanthropy, like the time he paid for 1,000 people to receive cataract surgery.
