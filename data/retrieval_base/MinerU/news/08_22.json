Simes, an adviser to former President Donald J. Trump’s first presidential campaign in 2016. Prosecutors have not announced charges against either of the men. More searches are expected soon, some of the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. Criminal charges are also possible, they said. \nThe investigation so far has focused on potential violations of the economic sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and a law that requires the disclosure of lobbying efforts on behalf of foreign governments. The government’s investigation is politically fraught, reprising the furiously partisan debate over Russia’s influence in the 2016 presidential campaign. By targeting Americans working with news organizations, even if they are state-run, the inquiry could also bump up against the First Amendment’s protection of rights to free speech. \nThe investigation comes in the wake of the Biden administration’s official intelligence findings that Russia’s state news organizations, including the global news channel RT, are working with its intelligence agencies to sway elections around the world. \nThose efforts include November’s contest between Mr. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. For a third time, according to the officials and public statements, the Kremlin’s propaganda apparatus has thrown itself behind Mr. Trump’s candidacy, creating online news outlets and fake videos to denigrate President Biden and, more recently, Ms. Harris. \nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence warned on July 29 that Russia was exploiting “witting and unwitting Americans” to create and spread narratives that were favorable to the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. \n“These personalities,” the office said in a statement, “post content on social media, write for various websites with overt and covert ties to the Russian government, Continued on Page A6 \n\n# \nAn Identity Forged on the Nebraska Prairie \nBy MATT FLEGENHEIMER VALENTINE, Neb. — Tim Walz was 14 or so, trouble-seeking with his cousins across a shaggy patch of family land where they liked to shoot air guns at birds. They had come upon his uncle’s “junk pile” one day in the late 1970s, a little scrap heap with a broken-down car and one unam\n# \n# \n# \nbiguous rule. \n“Dad specifically — specifically — said, ‘Now don’t shoot them windows,’” one cousin, Matt Reiman, said of the car recently. \nWhat happened next was probably inevitable: Pop. Shatter. Gleeful profanity from Mr. Walz — and a knee-jerk confession with no adults around. \n“My gun went off!” he shouted, as if it might have been an accident, formulating his pre-emptive defense in real time. “My gun went off!” \nRelatives said Mr. Walz would later deny culpability of any sort. “He could make something unbelievable believable,” Casey Reiman, another cousin who was there, said fondly, if still a bit grudgingly, some 45 years later. “Had a lot of giggle in him,” Matt \ngigg   \nReiman said. “Never had a seri  \nous day in his life.” Continued on Page A17 \nTop left, Tim Walz in high school.

Hillary Clinton called him “Dangerous Donald” and a racist. President Biden uses grave and lofty terms to describe him imperiling Amer\nican democracy. Vice President Kamala Harris   \nis trying something different:   \ndeflating him. \nThe first two nights of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago have brought into sharper focus the lens through which Ms. Harris and her allies intend to frame Mr. Trump from now until Election Day. In slickly produced videos shown to delegates and in speech \n# \nafter speech, a host of attacks emerged. Ms. Harris is the future-oriented change agent, and Mr. Trump is the stale past. He’s been playing a long con on the American people that has outlived its expiration date. \nThe goal of Ms. Harris’s antiTrump messaging is trying to shrink her opponent in order to rise above him, minimizing him and disengaging from him to avoid getting drawn into reacting to his every provocation. There is less engagement on highlighting Mr. Trump’s racist statements or casting him as a threat to democracy, than focusing on a portrait Democrats believe will resonate with voters: that of Mr. Trump as a meanspirited fraud who only cares about himself and his bilContinued on Page A15 \n\n# \n# \nPrice Policy May Not Match Hopes or Fears \n# \nWASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris threw her support behind a federal ban on price-gouging in the food and grocery industries last week. It was the first official economic policy proposal of her presidential campaign, and it was pitched as a direct response to the high price of putting food on the table in America today. \nIt is still impossible to say, from publicly available details, what exactly the ban would do. Republicans have denounced the proposal as “communist,” warning that it would lead to the federal government setting prices in the marketplace. Former President Donald J. Trump has mocked the plan on social media as “SOVIET Style Price Controls.” \n“To combat high grocery costs, VP Harris to call for first-ever federal ban on corporate pricegouging,” the Harris campaign proclaimed in the subject line of a news release last week, ahead of a speech laying out the first planks of her economic agenda. \nBut people familiar with Ms. Harris’s thinking on the ban now say it might not resemble either of those characterizations. The ban, they also suggest, might actually not do anything to bring down grocery prices right now. Those who spoke about the strategy behind the emerging policy did so on the condition of anonymity. \nProgressives have cheered the announcement as a crucial check on corporate greed, saying it could immediately benefit shoppers who have been stunned by a 20 percent rise in food costs since President Biden took office. \nMs. Harris’s campaign has created the space for multiple interpretations, by declining to specify how that ban would work, when it would apply or what behaviors it would prohibit \nIn the process, the vice president and her team are discovering the double-edged reality of releasing a policy proposal that is thin on detail: Anyone is free to imagine what those details might be. \nMs. Harris’s strategic vagueness on certain policy details has allowed her to emphasize broad themes that resonate with voters. Polling this summer by the Democratic firm Blueprint, for example, found four out of five voters supported prosecuting companies for price-gouging and Continued on Page A18 \nONLINE Follow news from the Democratic National Convention at nytimes.com, where reporters will be providing live updates. \n# \n# \nBEIJING — In the four years since she began driving solo across China, leaving behind an abusive marriage and longstanding expectations about women’s duties at home, Su Min, 60, has become an internet sensation known as the “road trip auntie.” \nShe has driven to the foot of Mount Everest and camped on the beach in the tropical province of Hainan. She has been featured in an ad campaign about female empowerment and inspired a forthcoming movie starring a famous Chinese actress. \nBut one key step in Ms. Su’s emancipation eluded her: She wavered on whether to file for divorce, worried about how it would affect her family. \nUntil now. Last month, Ms. Su officially began divorce proceedings. \nHer decision, she said, is a testament to how much she has learned to commit to her own happiness, and to the self-confidence she has gained on the road. \nBut her experience in trying to end the marriage also shows the Continued on Page A10 \n\nSu Min left an abusive marriage to travel alone across China, and became an internet star.

A 55-year-old woman was questioned by the police for a viral post that wrongly identified the suspect in a deadly knife attack at a children’s dance class. \nThese and other people are accused of being “keyboard warriors,” in the words of one British judge, exploiting social media to stir up the anti-immigrant riots that exploded after the suspect was arrested in the fatal stabbings of three young girls at the dance class, in the town of Southport. Their cases have now become examples in a politically charged debate over the limits of free speech in Britain. \n\ncalls for the government to Continued on Page A9 \nWith the courts handing down harsh sentences to hundreds who took part in the violent unrest, and \n# \n# \n# \n# \nRussia said it repelled a wave of drones.
