On Oct. 18, hundreds of Berkeley High School students, with the blessing of some of their teachers, left their classrooms in the middle of the day and gathered at a nearby park. \nSome Jewish students, and their self-described Zionist parents, felt frightened by what they Continued on Page A17 \nJERUSALEM — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that its tanks had entered Rafah in southern Gaza and had seized control of the city’s critical border crossing with Egypt in what it called a limited operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and infrastructure that had been used to attack and kill four Israeli soldiers on Sunday. \n“From the river to the sea!” One of their teachers, Becky Villagran, thanked the crowd of roughly 150, telling them not to forget that the toll of the victims of the war in Gaza was more than a number. \nJust as on the nearby campus of the University of California — famed since the 1960s for its marches, sit-ins and progressive ideals — students at Berkeley High have a long history of hitting the streets in dissent. In the 1960s, they walked out to oppose the Vietnam War. In the 1990s, they pushed to create ethnic studies courses. More recently, they have shown up in droves to advocate for Black Lives Matter, immigration reform, reproductive rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. \nInternational humanitarian officials said the military operation had halted the flow of aid from Egypt into Gaza, exacerbating extreme hunger and privation in the besieged territory. \nThe incursion did not appear to be the long-anticipated full-scale invasion of Rafah, a city crowded with about a million Palestinians, which Israel’s allies have been working to avert by pushing for a cease-fire deal. \nThe Israeli military said it had killed about 20 people in Rafah, describing the dead as Hamas militants. \nHamas said it had fired on Is  \nraeli soldiers on Tuesday at an  \nother vital aid crossing, near   \nKerem Shalom, along Gaza’s   \nsouthern border with Israel.

Many of them belong to prominent right-wing pundits, podcasters and federal lawmakers who, in some cases, have questioned Mr. Bolsonaro’s election loss. \nRIO DE JANEIRO — Just a few months ago, the political movement behind Brazil’s farright former president, Jair Bolsonaro, was sputtering.

In some cases, the demonstrations have included antisemitic rhetoric and harassment targeting Jewish students. \nFor Mr. Biden, a self-described Zionist, the speech was a clear assertion of his support for Jewish Americans as he struggles to balance his support for Israel with increasingly forceful calls for the protection of civilians in Gaza. \nAt 7 p.m. on May 7, 1824, Ludwig van Beethoven, then 53, strode onto the stage of the magnificent Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna to help conduct the world premiere of his Ninth Symphony, the last he would ever complete. \n# \n# \ndent said. But, he added, “there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.” Mr. Biden also denounced attempts to minimize the Hamas attacks, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed an estimated 34,000 people in Gaza. \n“Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and half start of the second movement that revealed to the audience of about 1,800 people how deaf the revered composer had become. \n\nThe movement began with loud kettledrums, and the crowd cheered wildly.

Bromwich, Maggie Haberman, Michael Rothfeld and Jonathan Swan. \nWhen Donald J. Trump met Stormy Daniels, their flirtation seemed fleeting: He was a 60- year-old married mogul at the peak of reality television fame, and she was 27, not half his age, a Louisiana native raised in poverty and headed to pornographic stardom. \nMs. Daniels’s fast-paced testimony lasted nearly five hours, during which she described an encounter with Mr. Trump, now 77, that he has long denied. Tension gripped the courtroom, her garrulous testimony filling a heavy silence. She made jokes; they did not land. \nAfter about a half-hour on the stand, she began to unspool intimate details about Mr. Trump, so much so that the judge balked at some of the testimony. He implied it was gratuitously vulgar, and the defense sought a mistrial. \nThe charges stem from her story of sex with Mr. Trump during that 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, a story she was shopping a decade later, in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid her \\$130,000 in hush money before Election Day, and the former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up reimbursements for Mr. Cohen. \nMs. Daniels said the future president had invited her to dinner inside his palatial Lake Tahoe hotel suite. He answered the door wearing silk pajamas. When he was rude, she playfully spanked him with a rolled-up magazine. And when she asked about his wife, he told her not to worry, that they didn’t even sleep in the same room — prompting Mr. Trump to shake his head in disgust and mutter “bullshit” to his lawyers. \nBut why had he gone deaf? And why was he plagued by unrelenting abdominal cramps, flatulence and diarrhea? \nKEY MOMENTS IN TRIAL \nBut that chance encounter in Lake Tahoe, Nev., some two decades ago set off a chain of events that has brought the nation the first criminal trial of an American president. \nAnd on Tuesday, Ms. Daniels took the stand at that trial, bringing the former president face to face with the porn star at the case’s center. \nPorn Star Recounts 2006 Encounter That Led to Hush Money \n# \nContinued on Page A18 \nContinued on Page A11 \n\n# \nMiscues in Jan. 6 Response New testimony shows how miscommunication contributed to a four-hour delay in deploying troops to help restore order at the Capitol.
