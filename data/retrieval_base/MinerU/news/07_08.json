Trump, according to five people familiar with the confidential discussion, including three who were present, all of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss it. \nThe consensus during the session, which was convened by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, was that a change at the top of the ticket was needed to preserve the party’s chances of holding the White House and prevailing in the fight for control of Congress, the people said. \nAmong those saying explicitly that Mr. Biden should end his candidacy were Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee; Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee; Mark Takano of California, the \nContinued on Page A15 \nUKRAINE A nation at war strains to stay neutral as the U.S. presidential race intensifies.

Trailing them was the National Rally, which took between 113 and 152 seats. \nThe details of the outcome may still shift, but it is clear that, to a remarkable degree, a scramble by centrists and the left to form a “Republican front” to confront the \nContinued on Page A9 \n# \nMusk Exploits Conflicting Agency Missions to Achieve His Goals, Inquiry Finds \n# \nBOCA CHICA, Texas — As Elon Musk’s Starship — the largest rocket ever manufactured — successfully blasted toward the sky last month, the launch was hailed as a giant leap for SpaceX and the United States’ civilian space program. \nTwo hours later, once conditions were deemed safe, a team from SpaceX, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a conservation group began canvassing the fragile migratory bird habitat surrounding the launch site. \nThe launch had unleashed an enormous burst of mud, stones and fiery debris across the public lands encircling Mr. Musk’s \\$3 billion space compound. Chunks of sheet metal and insulation were strewed across the sand flats on one side of a state park. Elsewhere, a small fire had ignited, leaving a charred patch of park grasslands — remnants from the blastoff that burned 7.5 million pounds of fuel. \nMost disturbing to one member of the entourage was the yellow smear on the soil in the same spot that a bird’s nest lay the day before. None of the nine nests recorded by the nonprofit Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program before the launch had survived intact. \nThe impact was obvious. \n“The nests have all been messed up or have eggs missing,” Justin LeClaire, a Coastal Bend wildlife biologist, told a Fish and Wildlife inspector as a New York Times reporter observed nearby. The outcome was part of a welldocumented pattern. \nEgg yolk now stained the ground. \nOn at least 19 occasions since 2019, SpaceX operations have caused fires, leaks, explosions or other problems associated with the rapid growth of Mr. Musk’s complex in Boca Chica. These incidents have caused environmental damage and reflect a broader debate over how to balance tech\nAn examination of Mr. Musk’s tactics in South Texas shows how he exploited the limitations and competing missions of the various agencies most poised to be a check on the ferocious expansion of the industrial complex he calls Starbase. Those charged with protecting the area’s cultural and natural resources — particularly officials from the Interior Department’s Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service — repeatedly lost out to more powerful agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, whose goals are intertwined with Mr. Musk’s. \nnological and economic progress against protections of delicate ecosystems and local communities. \nThat natural tension is heightened by Mr. Musk’s influence over American space aspirations. Members of Congress and senior officials in the Biden administration have fretted privately and publicly about the extent of Mr. Musk’s power as the U.S. government increasingly relies on SpaceX for commercial space operations and for its plans to travel to the moon and even Mars. \nIn the end, South Texas’ ecology took a back seat to SpaceX’s — and the country’s — ambitions. \nExecutives from SpaceX declined repeated requests in person and via email to comment. But Gary Henry, who until this year served as a SpaceX adviser on Pentagon launch programs, said the company was aware of the officials’ complaints about environmental impact and was committed to addressing them. \n“Blowing debris into state parks or national land is not what we prescribed, but the bottom line \nKelvin B. Coleman, the top F.A.A. official overseeing space launch licenses, said he was convinced that his agency was doing its duty, which is to foster space travel safely. \nContinued on Page A12 \n# \n# \nJERUSALEM — Israelis on Sunday marked nine months since the devastating Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7 and the start of the ensuing war in Gaza with a nationwide day of antigovernment protests at a time that many here view as a pivotal juncture in the conflict. \nPrimarily calling for a ceasefire deal with Hamas that would see hostages return from captivity and for new elections in Israel, protesters brought traffic to a standstill at several major intersections in cities and on highways across the country. Much of central Tel Aviv was blocked in one of the biggest protests in months. \nSome progress has been made in recent days for a resumption of negotiations toward a tentative deal after weeks of an impasse, even as the fighting continues in Gaza, where an Israeli strike hit in the area of a U.N. school on Saturday, and across Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. \nBut many Israelis, among them the families of some hostages, fear that the cease-fire efforts could be torpedoed not only by Hamas, but also by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel who, they say, might prioritize the survival of his government over a deal that could topple it. \nContinued on Page A7 \nThe Israeli military transporting a group of soldiers and journalists inside the southern Gaza Strip. \n# \n# \nRAFAH, Gaza Strip — The armed convoy of jeeps filled with reporters rumbled into a dusty Rafah, passing RAFAH flattened houses DISPATCH and battered apartment buildings.

While he still offers an avocado salsa with serrano and a red salsa with morita chiles and chiles de árbol, he wanted to provide a nonspicy option for international visitors unaccustomed to intense heat. \nWith more customers from abroad eating his tacos, he began noticing similar reactions to his pico de gallo: red faces, sweat, complaints about the spiciness. \n\nLUIS ANTONIO ROJAS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES “If you lower the heat on a salsa,” one Mexico City resident said, “now it’s a dressing.” \n“It attracts more people,” he said. \nChiles are fundamental to Mexican cuisine and, in turn, to the country’s identity. Mexicans put them, often in the form of salsas, on everything: tacos, seafood, chips, fruit, beer and, yes, even sorbet. \n“Food that isn’t spicy practically isn’t good food for the majority of Mexicans,” Isaac Palacios, 37, who lives in Mexico City, said after consuming tacos smothered in salsa. \nBut since the pandemic, the country’s capital — with a metropolitan area of 23 million people, a temperate climate and rich cultural offerings — has become hugely popular as both a tourist destina\nAs a result, in certain neighborhoods, the gentrification has been inescapable. \ntion and a new home for international transplants who can work remotely and whose earnings in dollars or euros makes the city more affordable.
