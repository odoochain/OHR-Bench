That would shutter Infowars, effective the day of the ruling. It would also place assets from Infowars’ studios and potentially Mr. Jones’s popular social media accounts in control of the families. \nSilencing Mr. Jones, who for years has broadcast lies ranging from denying the Sandy Hook shooting to denying the results of the 2020 election, would be a definitive win for the families. \n“For too long, Alex Jones has profited from the lies and fear that he peddles every day on Infowars, his corrupt business platform,” said Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the families who sued Mr. Jones in Connecticut. “The Connecticut families, driven by the principle that Jones must not be allowed to hurt or profit from the pain of others, are now on the brink of stripping him of his ability to inflict mass harm.” \nContinued on Page A17 \n# \nKHARTOUM, Sudan — The gold market is a graveyard of rubble and dog-eaten corpses. The state television station became a torture chamber.

Every few days, one of them dies. Once a proud city of gleaming high rises, oil wealth and five-star hotels on the Nile, Khartoum, the capital of Sudan and one of the largest cities in Africa, has been reduced to a charred battleground. A feud between two generals fighting for power has dragged the country into civil war and turned the city into ground zero for one of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophes. \n\nAs many as 150,000 people have died since the conflict erupted last year, by American estimates. Another nine million have been forced from their homes, making Sudan home to the largest displacement crisis on earth, the United Nations says.

Thirty-five millimeter, medium format, old cameras, new film. Analog work in a digital age. “When I tell my friends that we still do developing, they laugh,” Mr. Cohen said. “It’s a different feel. The finish is a different finish.” \nMr. Cohen works at 42nd Street Photo, one of a handful of legacy shops in New York City that still develop film. They have been at it for a century, riding the medium’s ebbs and flows — from film’s first plummet in the 2000s, to its resilient return in the early 2010s, to its rediscovery by yet another new generation of shooters in the 2020s. \n\nBut in this latest renaissance — born of Covid-era lockdowns — Mr. Cohen has noticed one of the practice’s most precious components has been lost. \n“They don’t pick up their negatives,” Mr. Cohen said of his customers, guessing that maybe 10 percent of them return for the rolls. Behind him, a colleague corrects him: “Five percent.” Another, laughing: “Zero percent.” Across the world, the small cadre of commercial film lab developers describe similar conundrums: stacks of forgotten envelopes, limContinued on Page A18 \n# \n# \nAttack Big Businesses, Progressives Urge \nCLIMATE CHANGE FIGHT\nThis article is by Nicholas Nehamas, Jim Tankersley and Kellen Browning. \nBut despite facing a tough reelection battle where economic issues will be central, Mr. Biden has not leaned into that message as frequently or naturally as some other Democrats, including senators running in competitive seats across the southwest and the industrial Midwest. The Biden campaign has not focused its television or online advertisements on messages berating companies for high prices, unlike Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who have made the issue a centerpiece of their campaigns — and who are outrunning Mr. Biden in polls. \nWASHINGTON — As high prices at grocery stores, gas pumps and pharmacies have soured many voters on his first term, President Biden has developed a populist riposte: Blame big corporations for inflation, not me. \nNow, some progressives are urging Mr. Biden to follow those senators’ lead and make “greedflation,” as they call it, a driving theme of his re-election bid. They say that taking the fight to big business could bolster the broader Main Street vs. Wall Street argument he is pursuing against former President Donald J. Trump, particularly with the working-class voters of color Mr. Biden needs to motivate. And they believe polls show voters are primed to hear the president condemn big corporations in more forceful terms. \n“It’s a winning message for Democrats,” said April Verrett, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which is knocking on doors in battleground states as part of a \\$200 million voter-turnout operation. “And clearly Bob Casey, who’s doing better in the polls than the president, is proving that it’s the winning message.” \nInflation soared under Mr. Biden in 2021 and 2022, as the economy emerged from pandemic recession. Its causes were complex, including snarled global supply chains, stimulative policies by the Federal Reserve and, to a degree, federal fiscal policies including Covid relief bills signed by Mr. Trump and the \\$1.9 trillion emergency spending measure Mr. Biden signed soon after taking office \nContinued on Page A15 \nPassenger Cars Must Hit Average of 65 Miles Per Gallon by ’31 \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Friday tightened vehicle fuel mileage standards, part of its strategy to transform the U.S. auto market into one that is dominated by electric vehicles that do not emit the pollution that is heating the planet. \nMr. Trump has made attacks on electric vehicles a mainstay of his campaign to retake the White House, falsely saying they do not work, cannot travel far and will “kill” the American automobile industry. Mr. Trump has promised that if he is elected to a second term he will undo Mr. Biden’s climate policies, including federal support for electric vehicles. \nThe mileage standards announced by the Transportation Department are among several regulations the administration is using to prod carmakers to produce more electric vehicles. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency issued new limits on tailpipe pollution that are designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032, up from 7.6 percent last year. \nBut Mr. Biden’s efforts have become a meaty target for former President Donald J. Trump and other Republicans who frame them as the federal government taking away consumer choice. The oil and gas industry is spending millions on advertising that falsely calls Mr. Biden’s policies a ban on conventional cars. \nIn addition to the regulations, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, championed by Mr. Biden, provides tax credits for buyers of new and used electric vehicles, along with incentives for charging stations and grants and loans for manufacturers. \nThe push for more E.V.s comes as the world’s leading climate experts say that retiring the internal combustion engine is critical to staving off the most deadly effects of global warming. \nBut at a rally in Arizona on Thursday, Mr. Trump struck an uncharacteristically supportive \nContinued on Page A18 \n# \n# \nOn a clear and sunny afternoon overlooking Utah and Omaha beaches, the president evoked “the ghosts of Pointe du Hoc,” the Army Rangers who scaled cliffs in the face of withering German fire, to link the struggle for freedom during World War II with the fight for democracy now — both in Ukraine and in the voting booths at home. \nPOINTE DU HOC, France — President Biden used the backdrop of the beaches at Normandy on Friday to argue that the fight for democracy in Ukraine and elsewhere remains as vital as the day that American troops helped rescue Europe from Hitler’s tyranny. \n“As we gather here today,” he said in a televised speech on the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, “it’s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day, June 6, 1944. It’s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us.” \n“They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs,” Mr. Biden added, as he stood on top of a concrete German bunker overlooking the English Channel. “They’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.” \nBut the enormity of his challenge was on display earlier on Friday. His call for American resolve in defense of democracy came just hours after he felt compelled to apologize to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for the political stalemate in Washington that delayed critical American military aid for months. In a meeting in Paris before flying to Normandy, Mr. Biden blamed House Republicans for the funding delay, which frustrated Ukrainians and arguably helped \nContinued on Page A5 \nMEMORIES Some in Ste.-MèreÉglise can still recall seeing U.S. paratroopers drop.
