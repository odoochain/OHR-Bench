Only two years ago Africa’s biggest economy, Nigeria is projected to drop to fourth place this year. \nDaily Struggle for Food and Health Care \n\nA nation of entrepreneurs, Nigeria’s more than 200 million citizens are skilled at managing in tough circumstances, without the services states usually provide. They generate their own electricity and source their own water. They take up arms and defend their communities when the armed forces cannot. They negotiate with kidnappers when family members are abducted. \n# \nLOS ANGELES — In his outsider bid for the White House, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is flanked by a team of unlikely political characters: new age health gurus, antivaccine activists, social media influencers, veterans of fringe thirdparty campaigns, cryptocurrency evangelists and militant environmentalists. \nJENNA SCHOENEFELD FOR THE NEW YORK TIME “The system in Washington is broken, and Americans know it,” said Jay Carson, once a Democratic insider, with his daughter. \nBut right now, their resourceful  \nness is being stretched to the limit. On a recent morning in a corner   \nof the biggest emergency room in   \nnorthern Nigeria, three women   \nwere convulsing in painful   \nspasms, unable to speak.

Unions strike to protest salaries of around \\$20 a month. People die in stampedes, desperate for free sacks of rice. Hospitals are overrun with women wracked by spasms from calcium deficiencies. \nNow a Hollywood screenwriter, Mr. Carson, 47, has the résumé of a Democratic insider. He was the press secretary for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. He worked for Bill Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Tom Daschle, Howard Dean and Michael R. Bloomberg. He describes Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to President Biden, as his political godmother and “one of \n# \nJay Carson may be the most unexpected. \n\n# \n# \nA taxi driver, Ahmad Zadran, was listed as a \\$40 donor to the candidate, Dao Yin.

Should age even matter? \nUnder New York State’s new generous system for publicly financing political campaigns, Mr. Yin claimed the Zadrans’ modest donations as eligible for $\\$1,380$ in matching funds. Yet in interviews, the Zadrans said they had not given money to Mr. Yin, nor had they even heard of him. \n# \n“This is crazy,” Raheem Zadran, 27, said. “I never donated to this guy. I don’t know who the hell he is.” \nHis father was equally incredulous. “I don’t care about politics,” \nIf approved, the ballot measure would amend the state’s Constitution, barring candidates from running for Congress if they would turn 81 or older by the end of the year before their term ends. \nStill, amid all the chatter about age in 2024, this ballot measure provides a rare chance to learn what at least one set of voters in the nation’s middle thinks about older elected officials. \nGranted, the ballot question on age limits for politicians posed to North Dakotans took the temperature of voters in a single state — and one of the nation’s least populous states at that, with some 779,000 residents. Experts say the measure would almost certainly face a legal challenge if it were to pass. And, technically, this proposed age limit pertains only to North Dakota candidates for Congress, not the presidency or any other office. \nOn Tuesday, voters in North Dakota were weighing in. \n# \nt the moment, the measure Continued on Page A13 \n# \nFor First Ladies, a First Photograph Sotheby’s is offering an 1846 daguerreotype of Dolley Madison, taken some decades after her White House years.

But the deal imploded \nWILMINGTON, Del. — A jury on Tuesday found Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, guilty of three felony counts for lying on a federal firearms application, a shattering blow for the Biden family in the middle of an unforgiving presidential election campaign. \n“I am more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from Melissa, my family, my friends and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome,” he said in a statement shortly after. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, suggested that he might appeal, vowing to “vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter.” \nIt is unclear what, if any, political implications the verdict will have. Former President Donald J. Trump, facing two federal indictments, pounced on the conviction. But other Republicans have expressed skepticism about the trial, and Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican allied with Mr. Trump, said on social media that the conviction was “kinda dumb.” \nThe charges that Mr. Biden was convicted of stem from the purchase of a Colt pistol in October 2018, and also included illegal possession of a weapon after falsely claiming to be drug-free on the standard background check required in all firearms transactions. \nThe verdict brought an end to an extraordinary seven-day trial that made painfully public Mr. Biden’s crack addiction, reckless behavior and ruinous spending — narrated by three former romantic partners, including the widow of his brother, Beau Biden, and by the defendant himself in the pages of his memoir. \n# \nContinued on Page A13 \nContinued on Page A14 \n\n# \nHow to Cut an Onion The cookbook author Kenji López-Alt dives deep into a question of his own, with computer models and all.
