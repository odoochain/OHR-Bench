GREEN and ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS \nWILMINGTON, Del. — Vice President Kamala Harris drew on her past as a prosecutor on Monday in her first campaign appearance since President Biden dropped his re-election bid, saying her law enforcement background would help her defeat a rival who is a convicted criminal. \nSpeaking from what had been the Biden-Harris campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del., Ms. Harris said her experience as a prosecutor in California gave her insight into former President Donald J. Trump. \n“I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” Ms. Harris told a crowd of campaign staff members. “Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” \nMs. Harris made a point to praise Mr. Biden, even as she tried to reintroduce herself to Americans on her own terms. The president, who has been recovering from Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., called in to the event at campaign headquarters, which featured “Kamala” and “Harris for President” posters. \n“I’m hoping you’ll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala,” Mr. Biden told the staff before Ms. Harris spoke. At one point, Mr. Biden spoke to his vice president directly. “I’m watching you, kid,” Mr. Biden said. “I love you.” \nBefore she previewed her campaign in Wilmington, Ms. Harris paid tribute to Mr. Biden during an event honoring college athletes at the White House. She talked about her friendship with Mr. Biden’s son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015, and commended the president’s “deep love of our country.” \n\nBut she wasted no time in starting to build her new profile as the presumptive nominee and the new hope among Democrats for defeating Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris raised \\$81 million in her first 24 hours as a presidential candidate, began an effort to engage delegates and scooped up key endorsements. \nIn the three and a half months until Election Day, Ms. Harris still needs to define herself for the American people before Republicans do it for her. She also needs to quickly take over the campaign apparatus that Mr. Biden had spent more than a year building. \nStefanie Brown James, a cofounder of the Collective PAC, an organization that supports Black candidates at all levels of government, quoted the rapper Jay-Z when describing the current moment for Ms. Harris. \n“‘Allow me to reintroduce myself,’” Ms. James said. “She has to in this moment define who she is, explain her record.” \nBut Ms. James also said Ms. Harris would need to form an effective message that used her work as a vice president and prosecutor to energize voters, some\nContinued on Page A12 \n# \nLOOKING AHEAD Kamala Harris’s first big decision is choosing a potential running mate.

He organized the West to push back against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and in so doing deterred Moscow from direct attacks on European nations beyond Ukraine’s borders. And he became the architect of a new American plan to contain China, though he never calls it that: cutting off sophisticated technology to Beijing while pour\n# \ning billions of federal dollars into producing advanced chips at home. \nBut Mr. Biden’s defense of his record came too late, after his shocking debate performance that led to his withdrawal from the race on Sunday. And now it will fall to a different nominee — probably but not certainly Vice President Kamala Harris — to defend that record from a radically different interpretation of the past four years promoted by former President Donald J. Trump. \nContinued on Page A7 \nThis article is by Katie Rogers, Michael D. Shear, Peter Baker and Zolan Kanno-Youngs. \nWASHINGTON — “I need you and Mike at the house,” President Biden said Saturday afternoon. Mr. Biden was on the phone from his vacation home in Rehoboth, Del., with Steve Ricchetti, a counselor to the president and one of his closest advisers. He was referring to Mike Donilon, his chief strategist and longtime speechwriter. Soon, both men were in Rehoboth, socially distanced from the president, who was recovering from Covid. \nFrom that afternoon and far into the night, the three worked on one of the most important and historic letters of Mr. Biden’s presidency — the announcement of his decision to withdraw from his reelection campaign after top Dem\nHarris Learned of His Endorsement of Her on Sunday, Too \nocrats, donors, close allies and friends had pressured him relentlessly to get out. \nHe would not tell most of his staff until a minute before making the announcement to the world on social media on Sunday. Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Mr. Biden went on to endorse, spoke to him earlier on Sunday morning, as did Jeff Zients, his chief of staff, and Jen O’Malley Dillon, his campaign chair. Senior advisers at the White House heard directly from the president \nContinued on Page A10 \n# \n# \nFor decades, Kamala Harris has been bolstered by a tight-knit group of female donors who rose up with her in Democratic politics. And for weeks, even when she was still insisting that President Biden would be the party’s nominee, these allies began to make moves to make sure her historic campaign would not be built on the fly. \nQuickly and quietly, her biggest supporters worked to rally support around her, creating enough momentum to effectively stamp out any opposition. They collected money, cut ads in advance and worked their networks to monitor the moves of other hopefuls. \n# \nOn Sunday, when Mr. Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Vice President Harris, all the behind-the-scenes maneuvering appeared to pay off. The nation’s highest-ranking female officeholder, Ms. Harris rapidly picked up pivotal endorsements without attracting a single serious challenger. Money started flooding in. Ads began moving.

Bloomberg of New York and Silicon Valley leaders such as Reed Hastings and Vinod Khosla — called for a competitive process, which Democratic donors and fund-raisers have been interpreting as something of a code to say they are not eager to support Ms. Harris against former President Donald J. Trump. \nContinued on Page A15 \n\nKENNY HOLSTON/THE NEW YORK TIMES \nSecret Service Director Pressed to Quit Kimberly Cheatle couldn’t explain the failure to protect former President Donald Trump.
