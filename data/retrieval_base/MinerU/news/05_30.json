Back in 2016, when the Kremlin interfered in the American presidential election, an army of computer trolls toiled for hours in an office building in St. Petersburg to try to fool Americans online. \nToday Mr. Dougan may be acContinued on Page A16 \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. declined on Wednesday to recuse himself from two cases arising from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after reports that flags displayed outside his houses appeared to support the “Stop the Steal” movement. \nIn letters to Democratic members of Congress who had demanded his recusal, Justice Alito said that the flags, at his home in Virginia and a beach house in New Jersey, were flown by his wife, Martha-Ann. \nThe revelation that provocative flags flew outside the Alitos’ property has raised questions about the appearance of bias in two cases the Supreme Court is considering related to Jan. 6. In the weeks after the Capitol attack, an inverted American flag that Trump loyalists have adopted to contest Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s electoral victory was aloft at Justice Alito’s residence in Alexandria, Va. Last summer, an “Appeal to \n“My wife is fond of flying flags,” the justice wrote. “I am not.

Johnson Freeway in an industrial area outside Dallas, the future of American military ammunition production is coming online. \nHere, in the Pentagon’s first new major arms plant built since Russia invaded Ukraine, Turkish workers in orange hard hats are busy unpacking wood crates stenciled with the name Repkon, a defense company based in Istanbul, and assembling computer-controlled robots and lathes. \nThe factory will soon turn out about 30,000 steel shells every month for the 155-millimeter howitzers that have become crucial to Kyiv’s war effort. \nUkraine fired between 4,000 and 7,000 such shells daily for several months in 2023, according to NATO’s secretary-general, before infighting among House Republicans held up further funding for Pentagon arms shipments. Large shipments of American artillery ammunition resumed in April after Congress passed an aid package that included \\$61 billion to Ukraine. \nTo keep Ukraine’s artillery crews supplied, the Pentagon set a production target last year of 100,000 shells per month by the end of 2025. Factories in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., together make about 36,000 shells per month. The new General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas, will make 30,000 each month once it reaches its full capacity. \nThe gap led to a drastic ammunition shortage for Kyiv, with Ukrainian troops able to fire only a fraction of the shells shot at them by Russian forces. \nJOAO SILVA/THE NEW YORK TIMES \nThe 100,000-per-month goal represents a nearly tenfold increase in production from a few \nConflict Causes Anguish for People With Kin on Both Sides \n# \nSHEBEKINO, Russia — When Valentina’s small town in Russia came under heavy bombardment in March by Ukrainian forces, her daughter Alla, who lives a short distance across the border near Kharkiv, would text her mother to make sure she was all right. \nNow that Kharkiv and its surrounding region are under heavy attack by Russia, it’s Valentina who is checking with her daughter to make sure that everything is fine. The regular check-ins have continued as fighting has intensified across the new front Russia opened this month. \n“So she’s calling me asking: ‘Mom, how is it there? It’s so loud here. I think there’s something heading your way from our direction. Mom, be careful!’” said Valentina, a dual Russian-Ukrainian citizen who did not want to give her full name out of fear of repercussions for both herself and her daughter in Ukraine. \nSimilar conversations are taking place all along the border region now caught up in Russia’s advance on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Not only is life in these areas physically dangerous, but it can be emotionally jarring, as sympathies are tested by family bonds that reach across the border. \nLike many living in the border regions, Valentina grew up in Ukraine before moving to Grayvoron, a Russian town six miles over the border, in 1989 to do \n“I say: ‘OK, daughter, OK, it’s all right.

Their bags, packed and ready to go, have been sitting by their door in Rafah, the city where Israel is now conducting a military offensive. \nBut Ms. Redwan has hit roadblocks at every turn. And like other Palestinian Americans desperate to get their relatives to safety, she has described a confounding bureaucratic maze in\nAmericans Struggle to Get Relatives Out \nvolving the State Department, the governments of Israel and Egypt, politicians, advocacy groups, lawyers and more. \nThe closure this month of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt — the only way out for civilians — has thrown an already complicated system into disarray, leading to calls for the United States to Continued on Page A7 \nMandela’s Party in Jeopardy In South Africa’s national election, the African National Congress may lose its majority.
