No, not that one. This was said to be the spirit of Emma Carelli, an Italian soprano who managed the theater a century ago, and loved it so much that she was loath to leave it, even in death. \nPerplexed and concerned, the merchant contacted The New York Times, which in recent years has published multiple articles about the abuse of children on social media platforms. In February, The Times investigated Instagram accounts run by parents for their young daughters, and the dark underworld of men who have sexualized interactions with those accounts. \n“The theater is a place where strange things happen, where what is impossible becomes possible,” Francesco Giambrone, the Costanzi’s general manager, told the children Saturday afternoon when they arrived to participate in a get-to-know-the-theatersleepover. \nThe Times opened two Instagram accounts and promoted posts showing the 5-year-old girl, her face turned away from the camera, wearing a tank top and the charm. Separate posts showed the clothing and jewelry without the child model, or with a black box concealing her. All of the paid ads were promoted to people interested in topics like childhood, dance and cheerleading, which Meta’s audience tools estimated as predominantly women. \nAside from reaching a surprisingly large proportion of men, the ads got direct responses from dozens of Instagram users, including phone calls from two accused sex \nWith the photos from the jewelry ads in hand, The Times set out to understand why they attracted an unwanted audience. Test ads run by The Times using the same photos with no text not only replicated the merchant’s experience — they drew the attention of convicted sex offenders and other men whose accounts indicated a sexual interest in children or who wrote sexual messages. \nThe shafts of light homed in on a spectral figure — a slim, darkhaired woman dressed in white, moving at a funereal pace and plaintively singing.

People landed in security files for attending protests or publicly criticizing Hamas. In some cases, the records suggest that the authorities followed people to determine if they were carrying on romantic relahas rested on its considerable laurels rather than cultivate a musical culture that encourages students to learn about their illustrious heritage. \n\nWith little backing from schools or lawmakers, arts organizations like the Costanzi have concluded that it is up to them to reach out to the young. \n# \nMr. Giambrone sought to dispel \nValentina Gargano performed as the ghost of Emma Carelli at an opera house sleepover in Rome. \n# \nThe documents show that Hamas leaders, despite claiming to represent the people of Gaza, would not tolerate even a whiff of tionships outside marriage. Hamas has long run an oppressive system of governance in Gaza, and many Palestinians there know that security officials watch them closely. But a 62-slide presentation on the activities of the General Security Service, delivered only weeks before the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, reveals the degree to which the largely unknown unit penetrated the lives of Palestinians. \n\nopera's stuffy image by abandoning the genre’s strict dress code. That change, like the sleepover, is part of his effort to make opera, often seen as an elitist, highbrow and abstruse art form for the initiated, more familiar and accessible, especially to children. \n“We believe that the theater should be for everyone, and that it should make people feel at home,” \n# \nEveryday Gazans were stuck — behind the wall of Israel’s crippling blockade and under the thumb and constant watch of a security force. That dilemma continues today, with the added threat of Israeli ground troops and airstrikes. \n“We’re facing bombardment by the occupation and thuggery by the local authorities,” Ehab Fasfous, a journalist in the Gaza Strip who appeared in the files of the General Security Service, said in a phone interview from Gaza. \ndissent. Security officials trailed journalists and people they suspected of immoral behavior. Agents got criticism removed from social media and discussed ways to defame political adversaries. Political protests were viewed as threats to be undermined. \nMr. Giambrone said in an interview.

Trump shook his head at much of the testimony. \nOver nearly five hours of testimony, Mr. Cohen painted a damning portrait of his relationship with Mr. Trump, decoded their shady vernacular and spotlighted the conduct at the center of the first criminal trial of an American president: the silencing of women who had stories of sex with Mr. Trump to tell and to sell. \n\nBut now, as he wraps up his second term as governor and campaigns for a seat in the U.S. Senate, things are looking dicier.

Then the president-elect changed the subject to his new job, saying, “This is going to be one heck of a ride in D.C.” \nNarrating the prosecution’s case in tell-all detail, Mr. Cohen testified that Mr. Trump in 2016 had personally directed him to pay off a porn star and had approved a dubious reimbursement plan. \nTrump’s Ex-Fixer Recalls Hiding ‘Catastrophic’ Daniels Story \n# \nnd this time, there may be to Continued on Page A14 \nContinued on Page A16 \n\n# \nCritical Moment for Ukrain Civilians fled to Kharkiv, above, from Vovchansk, where thinning forces were facing a Russian advance.
