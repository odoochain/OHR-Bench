Trump’s conviction, it quickly became clear that Republicans across the country would not run away from his newfound status as a felon. \nThey would, instead, run on it. Echoing Mr. Trump in casting the New York case as a disgraceful sham, Republican candidates and party committees used the first criminal conviction of a former president as a rallying cry — for campaign cash, for congressional hearings and for motivation to vote in November. \nWhether they were congressional leaders, potential running mates or onetime rivals, prominent Republicans’ speedy alignment behind Mr. Trump, with little dissent or discussion, was no surprise for a party that has increasingly made displays of Trumpian loyalty a nonnegotiable requirement. But their ready-made outrage was not just about lining up behind the nominee. It was also about basking in the energy of a party base that remains as adhered to Mr. Trump as ever. \n“The base has never been more motivated,” said Representative Ronny Jackson of Texas, Mr. Trump’s former doctor in the White House and a close ally. \nIn a 33-minute speech in the same Trump Tower lobby where he began his first presidential bid nearly nine years ago, Mr. Trump denounced his prosecutors as “sick people” on Friday and criticized the key witness in the case, seeking to pivot his candidacy from the confines of a Manhattan courtroom to the campaign trail. \nHis campaign’s announcement on Friday evening that it had raised nearly \\$53 million online in \nContinued on Page A13 \nDOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIM Donald J. Trump on Friday. \nCHERISS MAY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ,resident Biden spoke at the White House on Friday. “This is truly a decisive moment,” he said. \n# \n# \nFor almost a decade, Donald J.   \nTrump has done, said and sur  \nvived things that would have   \ndoomed any other politician. He even saw his support increase after four POLITICAL sets of criminal MEMO indictments last year — including   \nthe charges for falsifying busi  \nness records that he was ulti  \nmately found guilty of Thursday. The polls cannot tell us how   \nvoters will respond to the un  \nprecedented verdict. Most voters   \nweren’t even paying close atten  \ntion to the trial, and asking vot  \ners about hypotheticals is always   \nfraught. With his track record of \n# \npolitical resilience, there’s surely little reason to expect his loyal MAGA base to suddenly collapse after a guilty verdict — or even imprisonment. It’s possible he won’t lose any support at all. But in a close election in a closely divided country, any losses could be pivotal. While Mr. Trump has survived many controversies, he has also suffered a political penalty for his conduct. He did lose re-election, after all. \nAnd this cycle, there is one reason to wonder whether Mr. Trump might now be more vulnerable: He depends on the support of many young and nonwhite voters who haven’t voted for him in the past, and who might not prove as loyal as those who have stood by his side from the start. \nIn the last six months, many pollsters have asked voters to consider the hypothetical scenario where Mr. Trump was convicted at trial. It’s important to emphasize that these poll results shouldn’t be interpreted as simulations of how voters will behave after a real-world conviction. The questions don’t repContinued on Page A11 \n# \nSays Hamas Has Been Neutralized Israel Says War Will Continue \n# \n“It’s time for this war to end, for the day after to begin,” Mr. Biden said, speaking from the State Dining Room at the White House. He also gave a stark description of Hamas’s diminished capabilities after more than seven months of Israeli attacks, saying that “at this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7.” \nDeclaring Hamas no longer capable of carrying out a major terrorist attack on Israel, President Biden said on Friday that it was time for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and endorsed a new plan he said Israel had offered to win the release of hostages and end the fighting. \n“This is truly a decisive moment,” Mr. Biden said. “Israel has made their proposal. Hamas says it wants a cease-fire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.” \nWith that statement, Mr. Biden appeared to be revealing his true agenda: making public elements of the proposal in an effort to pressure both Hamas and Israel to break out of a monthslong deadlock that has resulted in the killing of thousands of Palestinians. \nAmerican officials have described Hamas’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, as interested only in his own survival and that of his family and inner circle, as they presumably operate from tunnels deep under southern Gaza. But officials have also said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has little incentive to move to a real cease-fire, because of the widespread belief in Israel that as soon as the surviving hostages are returned, and a last cease-fire begins, he will most likely lose his fragile hold on power. \n\nMr. Biden’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his re-election campaign, a day after his rival, former President Donald J. Trump, was convicted of 34 felony charges. At the same time, he has been facing growing pressure at home over the bloodshed in Gaza, which has led to eruptions on college campuses and on the streets of American cities, and alienated many of his own supporters. \nMr. Biden described the threephase Israeli plan as a “comprehensive new proposal” that amounted to a road map to an “enduring cease-fire.” But at several moments in the past few months, Mr. Netanyahu has directly contradicted Mr. Biden. And so far Hamas has never accepted a comprehensive proposal, declaring in its public statements that fighting must end before major hostage releases or any agreement with Israel. \nints of differences came alContinued on Page A8 \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden took on his newly convicted opponent on Friday, declaring that a New York jury’s guilty verdict against former President Donald J. Trump should be respected and denouncing efforts to undermine the justice system as “reckless,” “dangerous” and “irresponsible.” \nBreaking his long silence over Mr. Trump’s legal troubles, Mr. Biden directly and unambiguously characterized the putative Republican nominee as a lawbreaker whose conviction amounted to a victory for the rule of law. And he rejected assertions that the prosecution was a political witch hunt, noting that it was not a case brought by his own administration. \n\n“The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed,” Mr. Biden said in a hurriedly arranged televised statement at the White House before outlining his latest efforts to end the war in Gaza. “Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself. It was a state case, not a federal case. And it was \nContinued on Page A10 \n# \n# \nIn a memoir published in December, the professional mountaineer and former Miss Finland Lotta Hintsa briefly described an upsetting incident with a “very famous male climber” whom she didn’t name. \nDuring a March 2023 business discussion in the man’s hotel suite in Kathmandu, Nepal, he “kissed Lotta completely without warning,” Ms. Hintsa and her co-author wrote in the Finnish-language book, “The Mountains of My Life $2.^{\\mathfrak{s}\\mathfrak{\\ e}}$ “The situation was absurd, unreal and unpleasant.” \nBut in interviews with The New York Times, Ms. Hintsa said her experience was more disturbing than she had described in the book. And her story highlights a concern that women in the climb\nProminent Mountaineer Accused of Sex Abuse ing world are starting to talk about more openly. \n\nMs. Hintsa said the man was Nirmal Purja, whose successful 2019 quest to climb all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter peaks in record time was chronicled in a popular Netflix documentary. She said he led her to the bedroom, pulled off her shirt, trekking shorts and underwear and tried to remove her bra. She said she repeatedly told him no and offered excuses to get him to stop without agitating him. The episode ended with him masturbating next to her, she said. \nust need to get out of this and Continued on Page A6 \n# \n# \nJohn Norton, a retired police officer from Long Island, sat in a folding chair and watched his grandson’s Little League game in East Meadow on Wednesday. The quiet spot is less than a mile from where one of the biggest sporting events in the world would take place in a few days, but Mr. Norton, like many people in the area, was only vaguely aware of the details. \n“I saw the stadium from the street,” Mr. Norton said. “I don’t know the first thing about cricket, but I guess it’s going to be pretty crazy over there.” \nThe stadium he saw — the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium — seemed to have popped up almost overnight. Now it sits on one edge of the 930-acre Eisenhower Park, a massive — if temporary — cricket stadium that was built in sections, like a giant erector set, over the last 100 days. \nYUVRAJ KHANNA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES A newly built East Meadow stadium will seat 34,000 spectators. \nIt will host eight matches of the Men’s T20 World Cup, an international cricket tournament expected to draw the attention of hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide, even if most people in New York seem barely aware of its existence. \nMatches will also be held in six Caribbean nations along with Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla. The event officially opens on Saturday in Dallas, where the United States plays Canada. The stadium in East Meadow, which can hold 34,000 spectators, will be inaugurated with an exhibition match on Saturday between India and Bangladesh. \n\nThe Indian team arrived in New York this week and practiced at a nearby facility in Hicksville. This was all reported with great fanfare in India, a country dotted with cricket grounds of all sizes. \nSo why go to all the effort to host the event in a quiet park in suburban Long Island? The aim is to make new fans out of people like Mr. Norton or, ideally, his grandson. The International Cricket Council, which runs the event, estimates there are already 200,000 cricket players in the United States (up from 30,000 players 20 years ago). Geoff Allardice, a former professional cricket player from Australia and the chief executive of the I.C.C., said that even with more than a billion fans, cricket can become more popular globally. \n“One of the things we are trying Continued on Page A20 \n# \nA Real-Estate Controversy In a well-read post on social media, a Black woman claimed a white homeowner tried to pull out of a sale of a condo because of her race.
