        "text": "# \nAs 2012 draws to a close, I want to extend my best wishes to all the members of the NMRC enterprise and their families for a joyous holiday season. One of the joys this holiday season is the opportunity to say thank you for all you do. Your work does not come without sacrifices, and I am grateful and thank you for your service to Navy Medicine research and development. I want to thank you all for your professionalism and dedication and your positive attitude during these turbulent times. Your collective efforts have ensured that we are meeting our mission, contributing to the success of Navy Medicine, and supporting our sailors, Marines, soldiers and airmen who are working everyday to preserve the precious freedoms we enjoy. \nLet‟s remember those who are currently standing the watch so we can enjoy this time with our families and friends, especially Cmdr. Cindy Tamminga of NMRC and Lt. Cmdr. John Melton of NSMRL, who are deployed. \n\nWhile you enjoy the holidays this season, I ask everybody to keep a proper focus on safety at the workplace, at home, and while traveling. Getting where you are going and returning safely are the best gifts you can give your family, friends and coworkers. For those traveling the highways and byways, plan your trip to include adequate rest before starting, rest stops along the way, and ensure all the safety devices in your vehicle are working properly. Also, be prepared for severe weather and hazardous driving conditions. Stay mindful of the potential hazards and dangers that can bring unwanted tragedy to our lives. \nBest wishes for a happy new year filled with health, happiness and spectacular success! \nNMRC Commanding Officer sends, John W. Sanders III, CAPT, MC, USN \n# \n\nThe Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) is an operational medicine laboratory with focus on the submarine force and human factors within. This past August the Navy Surgeon General entered an agreement with the Commander, Submarine Forces (CSF) that established NSMRL as CSF‟s primary human technology laboratory, including all physical and mental aspects of submariner health and performance. NSMRL is tasked to conduct medical, psychological and human performance research; provide independent, objective reviews of human systems related projects and technology proposed for CSF use; and develop new and innovative concepts for CSF that use human technology. Working directly with Vice Adm. Connor (CSF), NSMRL is aligned with the submarine force strategic direction. NSMRL also conducts investigations in diving medicine. This year NSMRL saw the addition of an external hatch on the Genesis hyperbaric chamber. This addition allows the chamber to draw a vacuum and be “flown” at pressures representative of those encountered at high altitudes. Unique features of this chamber include the ability to lock-in and lock-out at depth or altitude, allowing for prolonged (months) studies. It also has the ability to study mission profiles that transition from depth to altitude and vice versa (picture a Special Operations Forces mission locking out of submarine and then scaling a mountain) without requiring any configuration changes. \n\nRecently NSMRL acquired NAVSEA‟s new DP1/2 diving system. The DP1/2 is a surface supplied air system that includes communications capability with the diver. This provides enhanced capabilities for underwater investigations, since the diver can receive directions and report back in real time to the topside personnel orchestrating the experimentation. In return, NSMRL is testing the equipment for general Navy diving use and validating/revising operating instructions for clarity, proper sequencing and procedural accuracy. NSMRL has a history of research in underwater communications, and with the acquisition of this diving system, we harnessed another improved means of communications with our divers. \nHopefully this gave you a peek into the operational research world of NSMRL! \nNSMRL Commanding Officer sends, Steven M. Wechsler, CAPT, MC, USN"

        "text": "# \nSILVER SPRING, Md. – Cmdr. Charmagne Beckett, a Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) physician researcher, volunteered to deploy on the hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19), now in its seventh year of conducting humanitarian missions. USNS Mercy Pacific Partnership missions began in 2004 as a humanitarian response to the catastrophic tsunami that devastated parts of Southeast Asia. Sponsored by the U.S. Pacific Fleet, it is now the largest annual humanitarian civic action deployment designed to strengthen bilateral relations with other nations, considered crucial to regional security and stability. \nFrom its home port in San Diego, the USNS Mercy set sail in early May 2012 with clinical staff mostly from Naval Medical Center San Diego and many individual augmentees from nearby regional commands. Beckett was a late addition to the mission, fulfilling the role of Internist and Infectious Diseases Officer and was the sole Infectious Diseases subspecialist for the entire mission. She embarked on the ship in Guam, joining nearly 1,300 crew members including civil mariners, U.S. Navy, Army, Air Force and nongovernmental organization (NGO) personnel as well as members of 13 partner nation militaries. \n\nCmdr.

Brian Bloom, Pulmonary/Critical Care; Lt Cmdr. Gregory Price, Cardiology; and Cmdr. Steven Romero, Cardiology. (Not pictured: Cmdr. Gregory Matwiyoff, Pulmonary/Critical Care.) \nUpon invitation, missions were conducted in four host nations: Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia. Over the 56 days dedicated to mission activities, more than 49,000 patients were seen and treated ashore, including general adult and pediatric medical care as well as dental and vision screenings at Medical and Dental Civic Action Programs (MEDCAPS). Surgeons of several specialties (e.g., general surgery, orthopedics, plastics, gynecology, ophthalmology, etc.) performed more than 900 surgeries via SURGCAPs, and veterinarians treated and evaluated more than 7,000 livestock and domestic animals at VETCAPs. Other non-medical projects included engineering repairs, construction and community service donations. In addition, Mercy staff participated in more than 60,000 hours during 62 subject-matter expert exchanges (SMEEs) on various topics such as basic first aid, nutrition, public health, disaster response, and food and water safety. \nBeckett presented ten SMEE lectures and participated in advising host nation health care personnel on issues of infection control of communicable diseases, disease outbreak response and specific management of diseases such as dengue, malaria, rabies and tuberculosis. She also supported the investigation and management of a shipboard outbreak of gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea) affecting 64 crew members over a three-week period while underway. Her knowledge of Navy research capabilities assisted the Sick Call staff in confirmation of norovirus as the cause of the outbreak via assistance from the Naval Health Research Center molecular diagnostics laboratory. During the mission, she also visited fellow investigators at NAMRU-2 in Pearl Harbor and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. \nBeckett returned home to Maryland August 24 and considers her opportunity to contribute to Pacific Partnership 2012 an extreme honor and privilege."

Photo from DVIDS. \nBy Kristen Wong, DVIDS \nMARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII, Kaneohe Bay - The smell of barbeque wafted in the air just behind Pollock Field as Marines and sailors from 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment relaxed and enjoyed their Friday afternoon, Oct. 26. But along with games, food and general chit-chat, many service members were rubbing the inside of their cheek with a cotton swab. Marine Corps Base (MCB) Hawaii was participating in a basewide drive to register service members with the C.W. Bill Young Department of Defense Marrow Donor Program. \nBecause 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines is scheduled to deploy, a drive was held during their family day. Service members were encouraged to fill out an application and provide four samples of cheek cells taken with a cotton swab. According to the program website, the information will be entered into the National Marrow Donor Program registry. If there is a match between someone in the registry and a patient who needs marrow, that person will, with their consent, undergo additional blood and health testing to further confirm a definite match and then determine whether that person is able to donate. \n\nIn the past two years, two Marines from MCB Hawaii were confirmed as matches for patients. Lance Cpl. Brantley Smith, a communications technician with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, and Lance Cpl. Joshua D. Epps, a machine gunner with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, both underwent surgery and donated their marrow. \n“Our mission is to get as much DoD [participants who] can help out (Continued on page 6) \n# \nSILVER SPRING, Md. – In 2012 over 42,000 service members, family members, and DoD employees registered with the C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program, joining more than 730,000 DoD volunteers who are potential marrow donors. Of these, over 5,200 have donated marrow for patients needing transplants to treat one of over 80 potentially fatal diseases. \nFollowing DoD donor drives like the one at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay, donor consent forms and oral swabs with cell samples are sent to the C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program Donor Center and Laboratory, which is part of the Naval Medical Research Center‟s (NMRC) Bone Marrow Research Directorate. The C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program is operated by the Navy and Georgetown University. Staff members at the laboratory perform genetic testing using the cells from the oral swabs to match potential donors with patients. \nEach swab is treated to isolate pure DNA from the genes on chromosomes from the cheek cells. The precise human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type (sequence of A, T, G or C DNA molecules) of each gene must be matched between potential donor and patient. \n\nWithin families, each sibling has a 25 percent chance of being HLA identical to a second sibling. But 70 percent of patients needing transplants do not have a match in their family and rely on finding a match from among 10,000,000 volunteers listed on the National Marrow Donor Program registry. Because of the incredible diversity of HLA types in America, many more donors are needed. There are thousands of HLA types from each of the four HLA genes that are matched for transplantation and millions of potential combinations of the eight types for each person, one set of four HLA genes from each parent. \nIf the donor who matches a patient is registered in the C. W. Bill Young DoD Program, a program representative contacts the potential donor and works closely with both the donor and the command. \n\nIf the donor is available and agrees to proceed, additional genetic matching is performed to ensure a match. Additional medical evaluations are performed to ensure the donor‟s good health and a transplant date is selected. The donor‟s cells are transported to the patient‟s hospital for transplantation. The patient and donor can choose to meet each other one year after the transplant. \nThe NMRC Bone Marrow Research Directorate provides military contingency support for causalities with marrow toxic injury due to radiation or chemical warfare agents. Exposure to radiation or chemical agents can cause unrecoverable damage to bone marrow, breaking down the immune system in the process. The directorate performs laboratory research that supports technology innovations to make highly reliable and cost-effective DNA -based typing for marrow transplants."

Dustin Harrison, U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 (NAMRU-2) \nPacific, has been immersing himself in the often strange and unfamiliar world of policy and strategy as a member of U.S. Pacific Command‟s (USPACOM) Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Disease (PI&ID) Contingency Plan (CONPLAN) 5003-12 Joint Planning Group (JPG). \nHarrison is currently assigned to NAMRU-2 Pacific as a microbiologist, but at the encouragement of NAMRU2 Pacific‟s leadership he has been attending a year-long series of \nworking group sessions at USPACOM Headquarters, Camp Smith, Hawaii. \n“At first it was very intimidating being in the room with people who do policy for a living. I‟m much more comfortable with the operational side of things,” said Harrison. “It was very interesting to see the dynamics and work that goes into plans and policy development. It was very educational for a JO [junior officer] like me to be a part of.” \nThe JPG was chaired by USPACOM‟s Functional Plans Branch Chief Lt. Col. Andrew Hocking, Australian Defense Force, and consisted of members from multiple codes at USPACOM and all over the island of Oahu, including Air Force Pacific, U.S. Army Pacific, Joint TaskForce Homeland Defense, Marine Forces Pacific, Department of State, the State of Hawaii, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Navy and Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit 6, among others. \n\nThe purpose of the working group was to update and formulate the CONPLAN to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate a pandemic outbreak of influenza or other infectious disease of operational significance and, when required, respond to Defense Support of Civilian Authorities and Foreign Humanitarian Assistance requests. Over the past year, the JPG met to conduct a series of Mission Analysis and Course of Action development meetings culminating in a two-day war game aimed at testing the CONPLAN and to identify strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement before the plan is briefed to the USPACOM Commander. \n# \n(Continued from page 5) families in need,” said Chief Petty Officer Arvin Salas, a hospital corpsman with 21st Dental Company. “Every 300 that register, one gets called,” Salas said. “The more people we can help the better.” \nSalas said a bone marrow transplant can raise a patient‟s chances of living from zero to 80 percent. \n“It can happen to anybody,” said Petty Officer 1st Class Dennis Gonzales of being chosen to donate. “It‟s a one in 300 chance. You can always be that one. Who‟s to say it won‟t be my kid 10 years from now [who needs marrow].” Gonzales added that service members are “prime donors,” as they are already required to be physically fit to serve in the military. \n“Everyone should have a second chance at life,” said Pfc.

These projects focus on disease vector surveillance, detection of vector-borne viral pathogens such as malaria, and vector control. The projects are enabling the country to independently expand vectorborne disease surveillance and detection capabilities in Liberia to benefit the Liberian Armed Forces as well as the entire population of Liberia. \n“Our projects in Liberia directly support our warfighters,” said Capt. Buhari Oyofo, NAMRU-3 commanding officer. “We also need to leave the knowledge and tools behind so they can continue to support themselves once we‟re done.” \nThe NAMRU-3 team visited Monrovia, Liberia in November to meet with key collaborators, including Dr. Walter Gwenigale, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare; Dr. Fatorma Bolay, the Director of LIBR; and U.S. Marine Col. Vernon Graham, the officer in charge of Operation Onward Liberty (OOL). \nThe Minister of Health and Social Welfare gave high praise for NAMRU-3‟s capacity building engagements in Liberia.

No malaria infections have been diagnosed in U.S troops since the onset of the spraying, which is carried out by NAMRU-3 in collaboration with the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence (NECE). This illustrates the risk reduction made possible with a force health protection policy employing both environmental vector controls and anti-malarial prophylaxis. \nWith the assistance of OOL, NAMRU-3 has pursued military-to-military engagements with the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) through vector control training efforts in collaboration with LIBR. \nOn a tour of Camp Edward Binyah, Oyofo met with Pfc. Nadoris Nador and Pfc. Henry Morris, two AFL Preventive Medicine Technicians. They told Oyofo how they had benefited from the training offered through NAMRU-3 AFHSCGEIS projects. \nNador expressed her appreciation for the training in vector surveillance, vector biology/identification and vector control, saying, “The knowledge and the equipment provided by NAMRU-3 has very much improved our ability to protect our soldiers and their families from disease.”"

In October, the tool was presented to the Force Health Protection and Readiness, Strategic Analysis Working Group Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs as part of the verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&A) plan for service acceptance. The working group forwarded their recommendation for accreditation to the Force Health Protection Integration Council.

ROMO is defined for this effort to include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities and various combat operations. The military medical planning community, until now, lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating PCOFs, which are necessary to develop the patient streams used in health care simulations. \nUsing an accredited PCOF tool, planners can employ baselined, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission.

To populate humanitarian assistance PCOF tables, patient encounter data from Operations Continuing Promise and Pacific Partnership, spanning the years 2008–2011, were used. Disaster relief PCOFs for earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and floods were developed from literature reviews and subject matter expert input. \nThe PCOF tool examined through this formal VV&A effort provides an effective, accurate and repeatable method of generating PCOF estimates using standardized and documented means of adjusting baseline distributions."

The goal is bringing these discoveries to market for the benefit of the warfighter. \nThe NMRC enterprise excels in facilitating local and regional partnerships due to the inventiveness and creativity of our research scientists and physicians. Most valuable biomedical developments begin in a laboratory, but the value to the warfighter requires moving that discovery through all the business steps, ultimately to manufacturing and distribution. This requires the establishment of appropriate technology transfer agreements. NMRC‟s technology transfer collaborations leverage research capabilities found in the public and private sectors to stretch research dollars and accomplish the mission of supporting the health and readiness of the military‟s men and women in uniform. \nFor example, instead of a company having to reinvent something that is already available in a Navy laboratory, or vice versa, a partnership can capitalize on each collaborator‟s expertise toward achieving a shared goal. Every time an invention from one of our laboratories is commercialized into an accessible product, the U.S. taxpayer sees a tangible return on their investment and the Department of Defense has a product that will enhance the readiness of military personnel. \nCooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) are key business vehicles among Navy biomedical scientists. This past quarter, the NMRC enterprise executed just over twenty CRADAs and reviewed an additional fourteen CRADAs for the Naval hospitals in Portsmouth and San Diego. \nOne notable collaboration is being spearheaded by Cmdr. Jonathan Forsberg (NMRC, Operational and Undersea Medicine Directorate), who is working with a company to explore a novel mode of anchoring prosthetics. This project could produce important results for amputees. Another collaboration being led by Lt. Roxanne Burrus (U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6, Lima, Peru) involves Duke University and focuses on evaluating the effects of changing demography and land use on malaria transmission. This is an important issue in light of the \nprevalence of malaria in developing countries and is important to the health of deployed warfighters. An additional malaria-focused collaboration is being headed by Lt. R. Vince Gerbasi (NMRC, Infectious Diseases Directorate), who is using mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Lastly, Dr Bjorn Song (Naval Medical Research Unit-San Antonio) is leading a collaboration focused on exploring the use of a synthetic oxygen-carrying fluid to reduce tissue damage occurring in response to hemorrhagic shock. \nAll of these collaborations have significant relevance to the military, but there is also considerable potential for these new sources of information and technologies to benefit the general population. Through the appropriate leveraging of resources through CRADAs and the commercialization of Navy Medicine inventions through patent licensing agreements, the NMRC enterprise excels at technology transfer. This is a key part of what the Presidential Memorandum was all about. \n\neffort to use mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens to be used as potential malaria vaccine candidates."

        "text": "# \nSILVER SPRING, Md. – The Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) reinstituted its Annual Mess Night, also referred to as a Dining Out, for officers and guests at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, October 17. \nThe President of the Mess, NMRC Commanding Officer Capt. John Sanders, led the guest of honor, Rear Adm. Bruce A. Doll, head of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery research and development, and the other Dining Out participants into the dining hall while the Navy Hymn played. When everyone was assembled, Sanders began the evening by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, mess night for the Naval Medical Research Center is now open. Welcome and thank you for joining us this evening, please remain standing for the playing of our National Anthem.” \nThe rest of the evening followed strict Naval protocol, an established tradition that reaches back to the Vikings and the British Navy, but with some special references to the remarkable history of Naval Medical research. The protocol included an invocation, a call to parade the beef for the President of the Mess to sample and approve, followed by the announcement that the beef was fit for human consumption and an invitation for everyone to enjoy their dinner. Capt. Stephen Savarino served as the Vice President of the Mess and took the opportunity to require \"poems and odes\" to the research accomplishments of our Naval forbears from the junior officers (who demonstrated both a grasp of our history and a flair for poetry). \nThe traditional mixing of the grog, a Naval beverage with a glorious history of its own, followed the second course and began the formal toasting. The first toast was to the Commander-in-Chief of the United States followed by an array of toasts recognizing the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and all other sister services capped by a salute to all sweethearts and spouses. \nThe President of the Mess introduced   \nDoll, who spoke about the history of Navy   \nMedicine research and development and   \nencouraged the junior officers, who will   \nbe the next generation of leaders in re(Continued on page 15) \nNMRC 2012 Dining Out Event. \n\nFrom left: Rear Adm.

        "text": "# \nUniversity of Notre Dame Public Affairs \nNOTRE DAME, Ind. - Capt. Eileen Franke Villasante, Ph.D., who currently serves as Head of the Malaria Department at the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) in Silver Spring, Md., gave the Eck Institute for Global Health Colloquium lecture at the University of Notre Dame October 24 in the very same auditorium where she sat as a student. \nThe once Notre Dame student had not been back to campus in “too many years to count,” according to Villasante. She studied in the laboratory of parasitologist Paul Weinstein, Ph.D., earning her Doctor of Philosophy degree in biology from the University of Notre Dame in 1982. A native of Long Island, New York, Villasante earned her Bachelor of Science degree from the State University of New York at Albany in 1978. \nUpon receiving her Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame, she began a quest to see the world while doing research. She never imagined one day she would conduct laboratory and field -based research on malaria, leishmaniasis and filariasis in places like Indonesia, Peru, and Egypt. This international career was in parallel to her distinguished rise in the ranks of the Navy, holding a variety of leadership positions over the years. \n\nFrom left: Ellen Flannery, doctoral student and Eck Institute for Global Health Fellow, Molly Duman Sheels, Ph.D. Lab; Emmanuel Adu-Gyamfi, doctoral student and Eck Institute for Global Health Fellow, Robert Stahelin, Ph.D. Lab; Eileen Franke Villasante, Ph.D., CAPT, MSC, USN, special guest speaker; and Katherine Taylor, Ph.D., Director of Operations, Eck Institute for Global Health. Photo provided by Notre Dame Institute for Global Health. \nVillasante went to the National Research Council as a postdoctoral fellow in the Leishmaniasis Laboratory as part of the Division of Experimental Therapeutics at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. She discovered the U.S. Navy, where they advertised, “It‟s not just a Job, it‟s an Adventure.” She was at Walter Reed for two years prior to being commissioned as an officer in the United States Navy in 1984. Not knowing that adventure would be the career of a lifetime, she signed up and has traveled to the deepest pockets of the world researching infectious diseases. \nOver her career, Villasante has held several leadership positions in the Navy including Scientific Director at the Navy‟s medical research laboratory in Egypt, Special Assistant to the Navy Surgeon General for Research Protections, Executive Officer of NMRC, and, currently, Head of the Malaria Department at NMRC. \n\nThe Navy Malaria Department concentrates on developing a vaccine for the malaria parasite. She is often asked why would the Navy or any of the armed forces be interested in infectious disease? Her answer is easy: protection for the troops. For example, in 2011 there were 124 cases of malaria, mostly in Afghanistan. Infectious diseases have a direct impact on our military and their ability to carry out their mission. \nCurrently, 51 microbiologists are serving the Navy in active duty around the world, including five research laboratories (Cairo; Lima, Peru; \nPhnom Penh, Cambodia; Silver Spring, Md.; and San Diego). The overseas labs also have areas of concentration specific to the infectious disease found in that area and function in coordination with the local Ministries of Health, academies, and sometimes, active non-governmental organizations. \nVillasante has been an integral part of the success of the Navy‟s Medical Service Corps and long history of success in infectious disease research. Their new slogan is a testament to her life‟s mission: “America‟s Navy: A Global Force for Good.” Therefore, delivering a lecture on Navy careers to young scientists in the same auditorium where she attended lectures as a student was more than a coming home, it was a completion of her educational circle. \nLife is cyclical."

The visit ended with a short overview on malaria research in the Navy labs outside the continental United States. \nZiemer said he was very impressed with the work being done at the lab, adding that he did not realize there was so much going on. He hopes to come back and visit again soon. \n“It was a great opportunity to have Rear Adm. Ziemer here to see the progress we have made in malaria vaccine development,” said Capt. Eileen Villasante, head of the Malaria Department. “Through his visit we were able to raise the awareness of the Navy‟s malaria vaccine development efforts and hope that someday in the very near future a malaria vaccine can be added to the President‟s Malaria Initiative armamentarium to combat this deadly disease.” \n\nCmdr. Daniel Szumlas (left) speaks with Rear Adm. (ret.) Timothy Ziemer (center) about NMRC's malaria research efforts. \nZiemer, who was appointed in 2006 to lead the President‟s Malaria Initiative, heads a group with a strategy to achieve Africa-wide impact by halving the burden of malaria in 70 percent of at-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 450 million people. The President‟s Malaria Initiative is a collaborative U.S. effort led by the U.S. Agency for International development in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the White House and others. \n\n\n# \n# \nSILVER SPRING, Md. - Dr. Andrea Keane-Myers of the Naval Medical Research Center‟s Biological Defense Research Directorate provided an hourlong presentation November 6 during Alumni Week at John Hopkins University‟s Bloomberg School of Public Health. \nKeane-Myers‟ presentation “From spirochetes to select agents: thoughts on an ongoing science career,” was well received by all who attended – graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty and the associate dean. After the presentation, she spent another hour answering questions. Keane-Myers received her Ph.D. in Molecular Microbiology from the school in 1995. \n\n\nCAIRO - NAMRU-3 takes pride in service to the American expatriate community, as evidenced by a flag folding ceremony held with the assistance of local Boy Scout Troop 201, Den 12. HMC Laregen Valdez and HMC Jaime Inda helped the boys, aged \n\n8-10, complete requirements for the Wolf badge Achievement Trail. After reciting the pledge of allegiance, the boys learned proper care and respect for the U.S. flag. \nHMC Inda said, “We asked the scouts questions about why we would fold the flag in a special way. They also wanted to know what it would mean if we dropped the flag.” With parents (including two NAMRU-3 staff members) looking on, the scouts practiced flag folding."

Here in the Washington, D.C. area, the weather has turned noticeably colder. The colder weather, combined with the crowded shopping malls, is a clear sign that the holiday season is upon us. As promised, because we are in the midst of the holiday season, this month I‟m presenting additional holiday budgeting tips. Not to be a Scrooge, but many people blow their holiday budgets because they get carried away by the excitement of the season. It's important to remember that you can still have a joyous holiday season without busting your budget. Here are some more ways to save money during the holidays. \nSet expectations with friends and family. If you're worried about your finances, talk about it with friends and family They might be just as relieved as you are to set limits on spending or, in some cases, to skip gift-giving entirely. \nLook for ways to cut back on the number of gifts you buy. If you have a large family or group of friends, ask if they'd like to draw names out of a hat and give one gift per person. Or give family gifts, such as a movies-by-mail membership or a pass to a local museum rather than individual gifts. \nLook for bargains and remember to use your Exchange! In addition to the usual tax savings and price-matching benefit, you'll find special holiday discounts. If you live in the D.C. area and haven‟t done so already, check out the nice new NEX in Bethesda! \nInvestigate your travel options. How will you get there? Do you drive instead of fly? Where will you stay, with a friend or relative instead of in a hotel room? Make do without a rental car? Plan in advance. If you didn‟t manage to book your airline tickets well in advance, looking for last-minute deals and being flexible about your travel dates can also save money. Maybe even consider flying immediately after the holidays rather than before. \nUse your credit card wisely. Finally, think before you use your credit card to pay for holiday expenses. Don't use it unless you know you can pay it off right away. Don‟t start your New Year with huge credit card bills! \nBeyond holiday budgeting, I would like to take brief moment to bring to your attention a couple of other items. First, the nomination period for Operation Homefront‟s Military Child of the Year Award is open until December 15. The award recognizes outstanding military children who demonstrate resiliency, leadership and achievement. One winner from each branch of service will receive $\\$5,000$ , a laptop and a trip to D.C. for an awards gala. To submit an application, visit www.militarychildoftheyear.org. \nAlso, Wings Over America Scholarship Foundation (WOASF) is now accepting pre-qualification forms for its scholarships. WOASF annually offers more than forty undergraduate scholarships ranging from $\\$2000$ to $\\$10,000$ to dependent children and spouses of U.S. Navy personnel having served in Naval Aviation commands (Carriers, Wings, Squadrons): officer and enlisted, active duty, retired, honorably discharged or deceased. For more information on eligibility and the application process, please visit www.wingsoveramerica.us. \nIn closing, I‟d like to wish everyone a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year.  I look forward to working with you in 2013!  As always, if you are in search of other resources or assistance, please don‟t hesitate to contact me. My email address is NMRC.Ombudsman@gmail.com \nHave a Fine Navy Day! Alexandra Mora NMRC Ombudsman"
