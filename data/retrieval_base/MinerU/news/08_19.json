He was killed after leaving home to protest Venezuela’s disputed election result. \n# \n# \n“Why did they kill my child?” Mr. España’s aunt, who raised him, cried at his funeral. \nJeison Gabriel España left home on July 28 to vote for the first — and last — time in his brief life. \nA day after casting his ballot in a presidential election that had united millions of Venezuelans in a call for change, Mr. España, 18, was shot and killed in the streets. The country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, had claimed victory despite overwhelming evidence that the opposition candidate had won. Then he sent security forces to crush dissent. \nNow, Venezuela is in mourning, not just for the roughly 24 people dead amid violent demonstrations but also for the last shreds of a long-tattered democracy. Whatever small spaces still existed for resistance in the country are vanishing by the day, if not the hour, as an angry Mr. Maduro pummels an electorate that tried to vote him out. \nFor years, many Venezuelan families splintered by migration believed that they would eventually unite in an improved, if perhaps not wholly democratic, Venezuela. Following the election, many are burying that dream. \n“I will never return to Venezuela,” said one young woman, a data scientist living in Chile, asking that her name not be published because her mother and other relatives remain in her home country. “Venezuela has become my worst nightmare.” \nIn Caracas, the capital, the police are setting up checkpoints to search phones for any signs of dissent. Black X marks are appearing on the homes of supposed opposition voters. Security forces are rounding up everyday citizens over the smallest indications of protest. \nOnce it was mostly activists who risked arrest. But more than 1,400 people have been detained in recent weeks, according to a watchdog group, Penal Forum. Many are everyday citizens, and more than 100 are under 18. The authorities are canceling passports of human rights activists and others, trapping them in the country. Journalists are fleeing amid tips that the intelligence police are after them. \nOn Saturday, members of the Continued on Page A6 \n# \n# \nGORNJE NEDELJICE, Serbia — Their windows broken and roofs smashed, the abandoned homes in an otherwise bucolic valley carpeted with cornfields and orchards near Serbia’s border with Bosnia look like the wreckage of the Balkan wars of the 1990s. \nBut the houses are actually the casualties of a current struggle freighted with geopolitics: where and how Europe can get the materials it needs to make electric car batteries and break its dependence on sources like China. The houses, in the Jadar Valley in the west of Serbia, were bought up years ago by the minerals be\n# \nhemoth Rio Tinto, which planned to tear them down and start mining and processing lithium, a crucial element for electric car batteries. Its plans stalled by vociferous opposition, the company left the properties to crumble. \nThe project has been supported by the United States and the European Union, which is in desperate need of lithium to meet its climate goals. But it has generated a wave of public fury in Serbia, where fears that the mine will poison the air and water have set off huge street protests against President Aleksandar Vucic. \n\nEurope has plenty of lithium and more than 20 mining projects for the mineral at various stages of development. But none have started producing battery-grade lithium. The giant project in Serbia was aimed at filling that hole. “There is no green transition in Europe without this lithium,” said Chad Blewitt, the head of Rio Tinto’s Serbian operations, adding that the company planned to invest more than \\$2.55 billion in the project. \nThe Serbian government gave preliminary approval in 2019, but, worried about losing votes during protests against Rio Tinto before a Continued on Page A9 \n# \n# \nHow did the best years of Amani Lewis’s career turn into the worst time of the artist’s life? \nFirst came the meteoric rise. A haunting painting Lewis made in 2020 sold at auction just a year later for \\$107,100, more than double its estimate. Two other works had recently tripled expectations, and a collector offered \\$150,000 in cash for new pieces fresh from the studio. There were shows in Paris and Miami — Lewis had seemingly conquered the market at age 26, upgrading to a new art studio and a Tesla. \nBut when the original painting re-emerged at auction in June and its price plunged to \\$10,080 — losing 90 percent of its value — the party was over. By then, Lewis had stopped renting a \\$7,000-amonth luxury apartment in Miami and temporarily moved in with their brother. \n“It was such a nice high and then it drops,” the artist, now 29, said. “It feels like, ‘We’re done with Amani Lewis.’” \nOver the last year, as money drained from the art market, young art stars around the world experienced dramatic setbacks that submerged their careers. \nThe Ghanaian artist Emmanuel Taku had a painting sell in 2021 for \\$189,000 only to watch its price drop in March to \\$10,160 at auction. Cubist-style portraits by Isshaq Ismail, which sold for as much as \\$367,000 two years ago, have failed to rise beyond \\$20,000.

The art market has been experiencing a downturn for the last few years, but the slump has been particularly acute for young artists.

She is drawing tens of thousands of fans to her rallies and raising hundreds of millions of dollars. A poll released last week by the Pew Research Center found that Ms. Harris has erased the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans: 62 percent of Harris voters now say they strongly support her, compared with 43 percent of Biden voters who expressed strong support for him in July. Among former President Trump’s supporters, 64 percent characterized their backing for him as strong. \nnot vote for Donald J. Trump. Ms. York-Singleton, who runs a nonprofit outside Detroit, grew up in a Democratic household but considers herself more of a political independent. And while she finds Vice President Kamala Harris’s sudden entry in the presidential race refreshing, Ms. Harris has not closed the sale for her. \n“I need more information from her,” said Ms. York-Singleton, 68. She listed the costs of medication and child care as well as homelessness as problems she wants to hear Ms. Harris discuss. “People are working two to four jobs just to afford rent,” she added. \nMs. Harris will have an opportunity to introduce herself to the many Americans at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Monday. She began the process of telling voters about her plans to address the country’s most pressing problems in earnest on Friday in her first major policy address since becoming the Democratic nominee last month. In the speech, she vowed to focus on improving the economic security of the middle class by lowering the cost of living and removing barriers to building generational wealth. \nBut even to many voters who lean toward the Democratic ticket, the vice president remains largely undefined. And they are not as enamored with her as those flocking to see her speak. \n“She’s famous, but she’s unknown,” said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic strategist and pollster. \ntill, in dozens of interviews Continued on Page A11 \nIn Sprint to the Election, Newcomers Combine With Biden Aides \nThis article is by Katie Rogers, Erica L. Green and Reid J. Epstein. \nWASHINGTON — Her revamped presidential campaign has quickly added loyalists from her 2019 primary bid. Her former aides have returned to write a convention speech and see her through a debate against Donald J. Trump. Her sister flew to Washington, joining her as she made a pork roast and marinated over her choices for a running mate. \nThis group looks nothing like President Biden’s tightly held brain trust, a group that was dominated by older white men and family members and grew smaller as he approached the decision to end his campaign. Ms. Harris, by contrast, relies on a multiracial, intergenerational web of about two dozen advisers, friends and relatives, firing up her phone every day to call in favors or ask for advice. \nAs Vice President Kamala Harris races through the final weeks of her campaign — the only weeks, really — she is relying on a network of confidants to guide her through the hurdles ahead. \n“None of us knew that this moment would come,” said Senator Laphonza Butler, a Democrat from California and one of several Golden State allies of Ms. Harris. But, she added, “when the opportunity presented itself, of course, we were ready to do whatever was asked of us.” \nWhile Ms. Harris has her own inner circle, she was also thrust into a campaign with only a few weeks to make her case to the American people. So she has accepted the help and support of much of Mr. Biden’s team, added a few Obama-era operatives and elevated some loyalists of her own to positions of power. \nThe message from the top to many of the Biden faithful has been: This is not a hostile takeover, it’s a friendly merger. \nBut the reality of a newly crowded campaign speeding toward November on a crunched timeline has led to tensions among staff members who feel there are now even more channels \nContinued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nCHICAGO — The request for a bid for the Democratic National Convention had been sitting unanswered in the office of Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago for two to three weeks in the summer of 2021 when Anne Caprara, the chief of staff to Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, burst into the governor’s office with a Politico article saying Chicago was being courted. \n“Why wouldn’t Chicago do this?” Mr. Pritzker asked, according to his senior aides. \nThree eventful years later, Chicago has a new mayor, the Democratic Party has a new standardbearer, and the city is completing final preparations for the convention. Through it all, Mr. Pritzker has been the constant, the anchor to which the city’s effort has been tied. \nIn the days before the curtain is raised, the governor has been out and about in his hometown — in a tavern across from Wrigley Field chatting with the MSNBC host Jen Psaki, at Wrigley talking to \n\nJIM VONDRUSKA FOR THE NEW YORK TIME Gov.
