Stephen Guertin, Acting Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [FR Doc. 2016–24142 Filed 10–5–16; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4333–15–P \n# \n# \n50 CFR Part 679   \n[Docket No. 150916863–6211–02]   \nRIN 0648–XE935 \n# \nAGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. \nACTION: Temporary rule; reallocation. \nSUMMARY: NMFS is exchanging unused flathead sole Community Development Quota (CDQ) for yellowfin sole CDQ acceptable biological catch (ABC) reserves in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area. This action is necessary to allow the 2016 total allowable catch of yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area to be harvested. \nDATES: Effective October 6, 2016 through December 31, 2016. \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Whitney, 907–586–7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679. \nThe 2016 flathead sole and yellowfin sole CDQ reserves specified in the BSAI are 1,617 metric tons (mt), and 16,933 mt as established by the final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (81 FR 14773, March 18, 2016) and following revision (81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016). The 2016 flathead sole and yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves are $5{,}472\\mathrm{mt}$ and 5,719 mt as established by the final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (81 FR 14773, March 18, 2016) and following revision (81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016). \n\nThe Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association has requested that NMFS exchange 80 mt of flathead sole CDQ reserves for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves under $\\S679.31\\$ (d). Therefore, in accordance with $\\S679.31\\$ (d), NMFS exchanges $80~\\mathrm{mt}$ of flathead sole CDQ reserves for $80~\\mathrm{mt}$ of yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves in the BSAI. This action also decreases and increases the TACs and CDQ ABC reserves by the corresponding amounts. Tables 11 and 13 of the final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (81 FR 14773, March 18, 2016), and following revision (81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016), are revised as follows: \nTABLE 11—FINAL 2016 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA (CDQ) RESERVES, INCIDENTAL CATCH AMOUNTS (ICAS), AND AMENDMENT 80 ALLOCATIONS OF THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS PACIFIC OCEAN PERCH, AND BSAI FLATHEAD SOLE, ROCK SOLE, AND YELLOWFIN SOLE TACS ,[Amounts are in metric tons] \n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Sector} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Pacificoceanperch} & Flatheadsole & Rocksole & Yellowfinsole \\\\\n & Eastern Aleutian district & Central Aleutian district & Western Aleutian district & BSAI & BSAI & BSAI \\\\\nTAC \\\\\nCDQ & 7,900 845 & 7,000 749 & 9,000 963 & 16,390 1,537 & 55,180 5,215 & 150,530 17,013 \\\\\nICA & 200 & 75 & 10 & 5,000 & 6,000 & 3,500 \\\\\nBSAltrawllimitedaccess & 685 & 618 & 161 & 0 & 0 & 14,979 \\\\\nAmendment80 & 6,169 & 5,558 & 7,866 & 9,853 & 43,965 & 115,038 \\\\\nAlaskaGroundfishCooperative & 3,271 & 2,947 & 4,171 & 1,411 & 11,129 & 43,748 \\\\\nAlaskaSeafoodCooperative & 2,898 & 2,611 & 3,695 & 8,442 & 32,836 & 71,290 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nNote: Sector apportionments may not total precisely due to rounding. \nTABLE 13—FINAL 2016 AND 2017 ABC SURPLUS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA (CDQ) ABC RESERVES, AND AMENDMENT 80 ABC RESERVES IN THE BSAI FOR FLATHEAD SOLE, ROCK SOLE, AND YELLOWFIN SOLE [Amounts are in metric tons] \n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\nSector & 2016 Flatheadsole & 2016 Rocksole & 2016 Yellowfinsole & 2017 Flatheadsole & 2017 Rocksole & 2017 Yellowfinsole \\\\\nABC & 66,250 & 161,100 & 211,700 & 64,580 & 145,000 & 203,500 \\\\\nTAC & 16,390 & 55,180 & 150,530 & 21,000 & 57,100 & 144,000 \\\\\nABC surplus & 49,860 & 105,920 & 61,170 & 43,580 & 87,900 & 59,500 \\\\\nABC reserve & 49,860 & 105,920 & 61,170 & 43,580 & 87,900 & 59,500 \\\\\nCDQABCreserve & 5,552 & 12,023 & 5,639 & 4,663 & 9,405 & 6,367 \\\\\nAmendment80ABC reserve & 44,308 & 93,897 & 55,531 & 38,917 & 78,495 & 53,134 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"
