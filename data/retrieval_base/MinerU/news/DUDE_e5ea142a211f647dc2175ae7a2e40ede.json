The following statement, as promised in \nthe last issue of the News, comes from Secretary Wickard, and.is titled \"Agriculture's Part in Total Defense.\" \nThis is Secretary Wickard: \n\"Farm people and workers in government agricultural agencies are anxious to help the national defense program in every effective way. \n\"The gravity of the situation which our nation is facing is evidenced by the sweeping program which the representatives of the people in Congress have authorized to provide security against all threats of aggression. \n\"We in the United States still have time to profit from the experience of the peace-loving nations of Europe which have now been overrun by the dictators. \n\"Nations which tried appeasement found they had only succeeded in convincing the enemy of their weakmess. Nations which depended on neutrality alone for safety now are quartering armies of occupation. Nations which permitted disunion are having their internal quarrels settled by the conqueror. Only those who put their trust in preparedness and in unity have remained free--and their freedom remains in deadly peril. \nThe marshaling of our resources to meet this threat means more than the forging of cannon, the building of ships and planes and the arming of soldiers. It means the ordering of our affairs so that our people will hold fiercely to the belief that the American ideal is worth defending."

        "text": "\"This American ideal means different things to different people and no one would have it otherwise. That is a thing we cherish about our way of life--we give the other fellow room to disagree--provided that disagreement does not imperil the safety of all. The American ideal holds sacred every man's right, within the limits of democracy and fairness, to speak, write, vote, and worship as he thinks best. The American ideai includes a decent opportunity to make a decent living. \n\"Total defense means the maintenance of these fundamentals and an unceasing effort to work toward these ideals, for it is these, essentially, which we are planning to defend. This is the ancient faith which must be justified by works if we are to remain secure and at peace. \nTherefore, we must take whatever steps are necessary to give every American a part in the national life--to make him realize that his skill and labor and his presence in the community are wanted and needed. \n\"In this emergency, it is vital that every industry and every phase of national life be included in a unified national effort. \n'A strong agriculture is essential to a strong nation. \n\"Fortunately, even before the threat of aggression, much had been done through the cooperation of farmers and govermment to restore the strength ofagriculture. \n\"Agriculture is organized to produce ample quantities of food and fiber and also raw materials to supply any likely needs. \n\"The increase in farm income, which has nearly doubled in the last few years, has enabled farmers to modernize and rehabilitate their producing plant. \n\"Farmers are conserving and rebuilding the fertility of their soil. \n\"Through the Ever Normal Granary program, reserves of food and fiber have been stored against a future day of need resulting from short crops or increased demand. \n\"Groups of producers who have lost vital export markets because of the war are able to protect their industries against ruin by making use of the machinery for production adjustment. \n\"Through the Food Stamp Plan and other programs for distribution of surplus farm products, agriculture is not only finding new outlets at home for these products but is contributing to the health andefficiency of the whole nation."

Thus, the first essential for the operation of decentralized industry--a power supply--is being provided. \n\"In addition to the efforts of farmers, agriculture is contributing to national defense through the work of research scientists of the Department of Agriculture, who are developing new sources of materials needed in the defense program. \n\"These are important contributions to defense. A prime duty of farm people and Department of Agricul ture workers is to continue and strengthen these efforts. All of us must develop understanding and readiness to adapt the programs to changing world conditions and the developing needs of national defense. \n\"Additionally, it is our duty to study and understand the situation which makes the defense program necessary, to kmow what total defense involves, and to keep acquainted with the progress of the defense effort. \n\"Here in Washington the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Division of the National Defense Advisory Commission are working hand in glove to speed agriculture's contribution in defense.\" \n# \nPatent No. 2,217,283, entitled \"Hydraulic Dump Bucket\", under date of Oct. 8, 1940, has been issued to Marcus R.

        "text": "EDIToR, SERViCE NEWS: The letter to yourself in the Forum of September 16, 1940, has caused me considerable thought. Possibly, just human nature is to blame for lack of interest in or use of the Forum, viz. \nIt is only human nature to put things off. One can put off \"blowing off steam\" until it is dissipated, then it is too late to write. \nA. person in a subordinate position, is rather reluctant to write anything which might displease a superior. In this ruthless age of keen competition, jobs are very difficult to find and most persons do not wish to invite dismissal. \nSome persons in administrative or supervisory positions are of a nature not inclined to constructive criticism especially from the ranks. \nThe cure for this would without doubt mean a great success for the Forum. In other words if, the person writing the comments would do so with a spirit of constructive criticism and the superior (who would without doubt recognize his relationship with the situation) would take the proffered criticism as helpful to the Service and himself and in the same friendly helpful spirit, in which it is given, much real benefit would be derived from the \"Open Forum\". \nI ask you, \"Are we humans, advanced enough to overcome petty jealousies, small natures and vindictiveness?\" \nSigned: G.L.W. \nEditor, Service News: On Page 4 of the October 5 issue of Service News is a letter signed, \"P.R.\", which prompts me to reply with something which I have thought of for some time, and that is that a much wider use could and should be made of photographs and picture-taking: In the past, SCS photography has been confined pretty much to the Information and Education Department and not enough to Operations and Evaluation. It is true that the Regional Photographer is on call (when you can get him) to go into the field, but even then limited funds often make it like \"puiling teeth\" to get proper service that might lead to more progressive methods. \nTo tie this to the letter referred to, I am thinking of such an inspection tour as this: One man -- the local key man, Unit Conservationist, or anyone under him -- goes out alone with a camera and with instructions or a good idea of what would be looked at if three loaded sedans drove over a man's farm. He brings the films back with a good report of just where he went and everything he saw, and pictures which he took. The next morning_ (and there is a lapse of fourteen hours here which the photographic laboratory will have to imagine) , he lays the prints before his chief, any other members of the office force, orany visiting Washingtonians. They look at the pictures. One man sees one thing he is interested in and wants to study further. The rest of the pictures are for others to see or not to see, depending on results or time at the men's disposal and so on."

        "text": "The same scheme may apply to a planning party: A one-man planning party goes out with a camera, or better yet is flown out with a camera, brings his pictures back and the Area technicians inconclave, or singly, decide what is to be done and the plan can almost be written in the office.... \nTake an example which happened the other day: A diversion dike is washed out, doing much damage to some private land as well as land of another agency. An agronomist (who did not build the dike, but who kmows his wayaround) comes along by chance, and reports it. By the time his superior, the engineer who built it, the owner of the land, two or three members of the cooperating agency, and the guy with the final word have gone out to look at the place, the next flood has washed the whole thing into oblivion. With the aid of a couple of photographs for the first report, the seriousness would have been apparent, so that a repair crew could have been on the job the next day. \nOur methods of recording with both camera and aerial photography are all the outcome of military observation information.  A Brigade Colonel cannot cover all the ground where his command is or is planning to go. Why should an Area Conservationist not adopt the same methods? Pictures always have much distinct value along with common maps. \n.. Never put out a picture without sufficient information accompanying it, captioning four things in this order of importance: (1) Where, So anyone can find the exact spot; (2) what it is; (3) when, the date; (4) by whom taken. \nSigned: W.E.R. \n(Editor's Note: Sorry, but poetry can't be used in Open Forum. A dandy poem was submitted by a stenographer, but our set policies preclude its use. We wish she'd come through with a letter, though.) \n# \nFarm groups in Livingston county, Mich., give their county program an element of unity through an Agricultural Council. The council is their answer to present efforts to coordinate agricultural activities in the field. They've had their- council for more than two years."

        "text": "Just who should get credit for the idea is a dubious point. It was just natural that County Agent S. B. (Red) Thomas should tie in closely with the SCs when a project was established in Livingston and neighboring coumties four years ago. In the same way he pitched in with AAA, Farm Security, and other programs. \nIt wasn't long until representatives of all the agencies realized their programs were interlocking. So they put their heads together, organized formally, and now meet monthly to exchange ideas for the good of the county. Most important result of the coordination idea is that several heads are better than one. Working together keeps all the programs on an even keel. And that avoids mistakes. Another advantage is that farmers realize there are several different federal and state organizations operating within the county, each having definite functions to perform, yet performing them with a view to how they affect the welfare of the whole community. \nThe council has done many fine jobs. For instance, when it came to shipping a carload of TVA phosphate this year, the council did it, rather than one agency. The council planned an equitable distribution of the phosphate, and signed a 30-day note at a local bank until money could be collected to pay the freight bill. \nMembers and officers of the council are: A. R. Hanson, Smith-Hughes teacher, president; Basil McKenzie, Smith-Hughes teacher, secretary; R. C. Behymer, SCS, treasurer; S. B. Thomas, county agent; Earl Grubb, county AAA chairman; Lionel Tate, Smith-Hughes teacher, Grafton Henry, FSA county supervisor; and A. F. Monroe, farm forestry project supervisor. \nAs other agency representatives come into the county they will be invited to\"join up\". \nAN-IDEA_EROM_IHE_IRI-RLYER DISIRICI.-POCAHONIAS.-ARK. \nAt the beginning of the present calendar year, Supervisors of the TriRiver Soil Conservation District were confronted with the problem of developing some method of spreading the district program more rapidly to the large number of farmers,_who were requesting help in getting soil conservation work under way. 'The technicians assigned to -the district by the Service could not possibly spread thin enough to meet all demands on their time. The excerpt below from the semi-annual report of the District Supervisors shows how they met this problem: \n\"Realizing that our program was becoming so large that the technical staff as well as educational agencies needed assistance, we were determined that our farmers not only learn from the. agricultural experts, but that they in turn teach each other the principles of conservation. Our community leaders, with two years' experience in holding group meetings for planning and work execution, were used as the nucleus around which we have built the \"Conservation Communities\" in this District."

        "text": "\"In order that we might share equally in the responsibility for the work execution program, the District was divided into four zones with a Supervisor in charge of each zone. The Chairman was not given a zone, as he assumed the duties_of coordinating the work of the agricultural agencies assisting the District, as well as maintaining our cordial relations with the general public. We four Supervisors, who have charge of work zones, live in our respective territories and have an intimate knowledge of the people and general farming conditions due to our having owned and operated farms there all our lives. \n\"That we as Supervisors should claim full credit for the reawakening of community spirit manifested in the new determination and self-reliance by our farm people would be boasting of the rankest type, for it. is through our local leaders helping to educate their neighbors that our work has, and is, spreading across the fence from farm to farm. \n\"During this six-months period, 35 community meetings have been conducted by Supervisors and community leaders at which 590 of our cooperators were present and requested technical assistance and labor from the District.\" \n# \nFrom the PHILADELPHIA (PA.) LEDGER: \n\"One argument against the United States ever again becoming involved in Europe's wars would appear to be the simple fact that when we got into the iast conflict we wrecked millions of acres of fertile land and turned them into a desert. The topsoil which washed away down the Mississippi or which blew away in the duststorms that wreaked havoc in the early thirties cannot be replaced in anything short of several hundred years. According to those who should kmow, the Dust Bowl had its birth in just one thing -- the World War. One hundred twenty-five million acres of American land have already lost the best of their topsoil through gully erosion. Another 100,000,000 acres at this moment are starting along the same road to final ruin. \n\"These shocking figures should demonstrate even to city dwellers that keeping rich topsoil tied to its base on the plains of America is more important to us than all the wars yet to be fought on the other side of the Atlantic. If we do not attend to the job of soil conservation confronting us the America of the future may come to resemble those starkly dead hills and valleys of China which are pictured in the geography books."

College, writes that the seven South Carolina Master Farmers recently selected are all strongly soil-building conscious and livestock-minded. They have as important planks in their platforms of successful farming (1) soil conservation for more profitable crop yields, and (2) livestock production as a source of income to improve and balance crop production; Dr. Earl Wooddell Sheets, former Chief of Animal Husbandry, started a three-article series, the first of which is entitled \"Swing Back to Grass\", covering the history of soil erosion in this country; E. R. Jackman, Farm Crops Specialist at Oregon State College, writes on the relationship between trees and soil-building; A. W. Blair of the New Jersey Experiment Station writes on \"Building Better Soil.\" Mr. Blair quotes a ietter written by George Washington to Arthur Young of England, Dec. 12, 1793, in which Washington tells Young that his farm was originally good land but that it had been, to a certain extent, abused and therefore depleted of some of its natural fertility."
