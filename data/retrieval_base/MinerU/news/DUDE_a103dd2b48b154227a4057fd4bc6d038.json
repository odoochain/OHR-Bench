        "text": "# \nhe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology plays a critical supporting role in maintaining the health readiness of our forces deployed in the Global War on Terror. For soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, a rapid, accurate diagnosis from the experts at the AFIP   \nmeans better medical treatment and a faster, safer return to duty. \nThe AFIP’s multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis helps to ensure that our service members, and their families here at home, receive the finest health care available. In 2004, AFIP’s worldclass staff made the initial diagnosis in over 8,700 cases contributed by military treatment facilities, and made a major diagnostic change in 196 others, directly impacting patient treatment options. \nThe AFIP is poised to address future military challenges with the world’s largest repository of tissue and tumor specimens, molecular and genetic techniques to combat disease, case-based education offerings for military health care providers, and scientific laboratories that provide a full range of new and evolving diagnostic and therapeutic aids to DoD hospital laboratories. \nThe AFIP has time and again proven to be an essential resource for military medical programs—for the US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the DoD Global Emerging Infections System, to name just a few. I look forward to the Institute’s continued development of technology and resources in support of military medical operations around the globe. \nLTG Kevin C. Kiley, MD   \nUS Army Surgeon General   \nCommander, US Army Medical Command"

        "text": "# \n\nn 2004, the AFIP continued the dynamic challenge of transforming services and realigning resources to meet the requirements of present and future missions. How will we support military medicine in 2005, 2010, and even 2020? I expect that 3 very promising initiatives currently under development at the Institute will play a crucial role in the future of military and civilian medicine. \n\nThe first, tissue microarrays (TMA), utilizes our vast repository of 50 million paraffin-embedded blocks and 10 million formalin-fixed tissue specimens. The creation of one unique slide from multiple pathology cases will provide significant opportunities to enhance research and education. \nThe second initiative is the AFIP Telepathology Program in direct support of the Army Telemedicine Program. In the last year alone, with 26 real-time systems deployed around the world, military cases increased from 268 to 373. Telemedicine offers a practical, cost-saving alternative for military pathologists and physicians in need of our services, and has tremendous potential for biodefense and homeland security. \nOur third initiative is Ask AFIP™, a Web-based program that premieres in the summer of 2005. Ask AFIP™ will link several of the Institute’s unique assets, including case materials, authoritative publications by AFIP staff, and museum collections, to provide an innovative educational experience to military and civilian pathologists, radiologists, and related specialists. \nThese initiatives, and a strong foundation of world-class pathology expertise, ensure that the AFIP will have a critical role in support of military missions over the next 15 years. \nThis annual report gives an overview of the critical support the AFIP provided to deployed military personnel around the globe during 2004, including forensic investigations, identifying and treating infectious disease and environmental threats, offering advanced telemedicine, courses, and distance learning for military medical personnel, and collaborating on almost 200 pathology research protocols. Next year, we will continue to focus on restructuring and realigning. \nWhatever the mission, wherever the need, the AFIP will use the newest advances in technology, communication, and diagnostics to provide the world’s finest pathology and related services to our military personnel and the civilian medical community."

Through onsite investigations, our MEs have correlated tourniquet use with reduced mortality, and pattern injuries with enemy weaponry and personnel configurations in armored vehicles. \nOur Ballistics Research Range plays a major role in testing and developing new-generation body armor, such as a new land mine boot, and in conducting research on battlefield injuries, including a new penetrating wound sensor.
