More than two weeks later, however, the response has not come as Hezbollah strikes a delicate balance between the vengeance it seeks and the risks of a backlash at home. \nThe group has cemented its position over the last three decades after outmaneuvering its domestic foes in a political system that divides power by sect. The group has amassed a large and potent arsenal and is more powerful than the national military. It controls or has oversight of the country’s most important infrastructure. And it has lifted up its constituents in the process, empowering, enriching and providing services to Shiites in Lebanon, a historically marginalized sect. \nLebanon is already deep in turmoil from a yearslong political and economic crisis, and its citizens are tired of strife. The country has careened from one crisis to the next since a 15-year civil war broke out in 1975. And if Hezbollah ends up in another punishing war with Israel now, the nation could well turn against it. \nThe Lebanese state is made up of a multitude of factions and sects, and it has been controlled for years by an ineffectual caretaker government. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim group, is both part of that coalition government and considered the real power underpinning Lebanon. \nAs the dominant political and military force in the entire country, Hezbollah has everything to lose and knows it must tread carefully. \nMany of Lebanon’s Shiites now benefit from a plethora of services run by Hezbollah, including quality health care, free education and even a boy scouts program. Meanwhile, a broken and broke Lebanese state struggles to provide even the most basic services, such as electricity, for all its citizens. And no other political party has the funds or organization to provide for their own sect as well as Hezbollah. \nContinued on Page A6 \nVice President Kamala Harris sought to personalize the impact of her economic policies, as she spoke in Raleigh, N.C., on Friday. \nERIN SCHAFF/THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \n# \n# \nKYIV, Ukraine — Russian troops are closing in on the strategic eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, according to opensource battlefield maps, casting doubts on Ukraine’s hopes that its new offensive into western Russia will prompt Moscow to scale back its attacks elsewhere on the battlefield. \nAfter capturing several villages in the area and pushing along a railway line, Russian forces are now about eight miles from Pokrovsk, one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds in the Donetsk region, according to the maps, which are based on combat footage and satellite images. \nThe capture of the city would bring Russia a step closer to its long-held goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region, much of which it \nKyiv’s Goal of Diverting Invaders Is in Doubt already controls. Pokrovsk, a city with a prewar population of about 60,000, sits on a key road linking several cities that form a defensive arc protecting the part of Donetsk that is still held by Ukraine. The situation is so dire that the city’s military administration has urged residents to leave, although it has not issued a formal order. “The enemy is rapidly approaching the outskirts of Pokrovsk,” Serhii Dobriak, the head of the military administration, said on Thursday. “Evacuation is underway in the community. Don’t delay!” \n\nRussia’s advance toward Continued on Page A5 \nThe lawsuit centers on a 2020 video that purported to show election fraud in Georgia.

Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Green, Jim Tankersley and Nicholas Nehamas. \nRALEIGH, N.C. — Vice President Kamala Harris unspooled her economic agenda on Friday in her first major policy address, casting her vision as one for the future and former President Donald J. Trump’s as of the past, as she argued that she would improve the lives of middle-class Americans and benefit generations of their descendants. \nIn a roughly 30-minute speech in Raleigh, N.C., she painted a sharp contrast between herself and Mr. Trump, who has spent more time attacking President Biden’s economic policies than laying out his own. \nThe speech reflected her fight with Mr. Trump over how to frame the economic debate in the election. While she tries to make it a choice between competing policy agendas, with diverging possible effects on workers, families and the nation’s economic health, Mr. Trump has tried to present the issue as a referendum on the economic stewardship of Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump has focused particularly on the surge of inflation on the Biden administration’s watch. \n“This election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for our nation,” Ms. Harris said. “One — ours — focused on the future and the other focused on the past. We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy.” \nIn her speech, Ms. Harris emphasized middle-class Americans’ everyday experiences, like sitting at the kitchen table paying their bills or browsing grocery-store shelves. She detailed how she would build what she called an “opportunity economy” that would reduce the cost of living, provide economic security and remove barriers to building generational wealth. \n“As president, I will be laser-foContinued on Page A9 \n# \n# \nOn the day Matthew Perry died, his live-in personal assistant gave him his first ketamine shot of the morning at around 8:30 a.m. About four hours later, while Mr. Perry watched a movie at his home in Los Angeles, the assistant gave him another injection. \nIt was only about 40 minutes later that Mr. Perry wanted another shot, the assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, recalled in a plea agreement that he signed. \n“Shoot me up with a big one,” Mr. Perry told Mr. Iwamasa, according to the agreement, and asked him to prepare his hot tub. \nSo Mr. Iwamasa filled a syringe with ketamine, gave his boss a third shot and left the house to run some errands, according to court papers. When he returned, he found Mr. Perry face down in the water, dead. \nMr. Iwamasa was one of five people who the authorities in California said this week had been charged with a conspiracy to distribute ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, to Mr. Perry.

Twitty was taking it all in: the jackmen lifting the racecars, the whizzing of air guns screwing in lug nuts, the slinging of 50-pound wheels. For a South Carolina native like the 24-year-old Twitty, the cacophonous scene was just this side of paradise. \n“I’m ready to make this my home,” Twitty said. He was one of 55 recruits who attended the annual pit crew combine for Hendrick Motorsports. The auto racing team’s coaches and trainers use the all-day event in June — and a smaller, three-day minicamp held last week — to find a half dozen or so athletes capable of jumping onto a track, gassing a car and changing tires in less than 10 seconds. \nTwitty, a former running back at the University of South Carolina, was in attendance because Hendrick and other teams have learned that former football players often make the best prospects for five-man crews, thanks to their strength, agility and speed. So teams scour college campuses looking for players like Twitty who didn’t catch on with an N.F.L. team and want to trade their football helmets for fireproof suits. A few, like Twitty, know about NASCAR — he grew up rooting for the driver Denny Hamlin — but most are new to the sport and can barely change the oil on their own cars. \nTRAVIS DOVE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ,Max Marsh, a former Kansas State football player, joined 54 recruits at a pit crew combine in June. \n\n“You don’t grow up playing pit crew in your backyard,” said Keith Flynn, Hendrick’s developmental pit crew director, who has recruited athletes for 14 years. “Most of these football guys had no idea that this is even an opportunity. But once they come on campus and see the place, they get pretty excited.” NASCAR races can cover up to 600 miles, with cars zipping around the track approaching 200 miles per hour.
