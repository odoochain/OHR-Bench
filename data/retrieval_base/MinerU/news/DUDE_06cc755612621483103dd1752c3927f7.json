This nationally needed and unique teaching and applied research activity in imag ing science,housed within the walls of thisnewfacility,will serve asa fitting memorial to thegenius of Chester F. Carlson,'he said. \nWhencompletedinthefallof1989,the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science will be the largest academic facility of itskind inNorth America.Including bothclassrooms andresearchfacilities,it is designed to serve asaninternational resource for theimaging community \nAs a scientist-humanitarian, Chester F. Carlson gave the world a process that hasrevolutionizedthedistributionofinformation,'said President M.Richard Rose. \"Xerography, a cornerstone of imaging science,hasled to applicationsthathave expandedmankind'sknowledgeandimprovedourstandardoflivinginfieldsas diverse aselectronicprinting andxeroradiography for medical diagnosis. \nGuestsincluding(standingfromleft)DavidKearns,ChairmanandchiefexecutiveofficerofXerox Corp.;newscasterWalterCronkite;andRITProvostThomasR.Ploughattended the5Othanniversary celebrationofxerographyandtheannouncementthattheCenterforImagingSciencewouldbenamed forChesterF.Carlson.AspecialguestwasMrs.DorrisCarlson(seated),Carlson'swidow. \nDuringhislifetime,Carlson was a member of theNathanielRochesterSociety and anactivesupporterofRIT aswell as otheruniversities and charities,often making donations anonymously.He died in1968. \n\n\"Although my husband prized his anonymity,Ifeelhewouldbeproud that RIT chose to name its Center for Imaging Science for him,'said Mrs.Dorris Carlson,his widow.A very large portion ofhisfortunewent tovarious universities andcollegesbecausehefelteducationof ouryoungpeoplewassovital to theindividual and to the future of our country. \nAs a young lawyer and physicist living in Queensinthe1930s,Carlsonwasfrustrated by the costly and time-consuming methods then used to copy documents.He theorized that thephenomenaofelectrostatics andphotoconductivity could be used toproducedry copiesofprintedmaterials. On Oct.22,1938,he and his assistant produced animage on azincplate,which he transferred to wax paper,creating a xerographiccopy. \nAlthoughmore than20companies turned down his idea,telling him it could not be commercialized,the concept was boughtbyTheHaloid Company of Rochester.The copier became such a stunning success that Haloidrenameditself inrecognition of its greatest product. Today, it isXerox Corporation. \n\"Chester Carlson is one of the true pioneering giants of imaging,' said Rodney Shaw,director of the Center for ImagingScience.“The timeliness of his inventionand the technical evolution it has fostered in the past 50 years are a major reasonfortheexistenceoftheCenterfor ImagingScience.\" \n# \n\nRobert H.Downie \nRobert H.Downie,an RIT trustee and presidentofR.H.DownieDevelopment Inc.,animagingresearch andinvestment company inKenmore,N.Y.,will serve as thenewchairmanofRIT's\\$30million Graphic Arts Capital Campaign.The fundraisinginitiative,partofRIT's $\\$100\\mathrm{mil}$ lion“Access to theFuture'capital campaign,willhelp strengthen the internationalleadershiproleoftheSchoolof \n\n# \nSeededfirstintheNewYorkState region,RIThostsnumberfour,StateUniversityofNewYork(SUNY)atBinghamton,at ${1}\\mathrm{p.m.}$ ,Sunday,Nov.6.Theother firstroundregional contestpitsnumber three,AlfredUniversity atnumbertwo, Clarkson University,at ${2}\\mathtt{p.m.}$ ,Saturday, Nov.5.Dateandsitefortheregionalcham pionshipwillbedetermined afterthefirst matches. \nFor the seventh straightyear,theRIT men'ssoccerteamwill competeinthe National CollegiateAthleticAssociation (NCAA)Division IlI soccer playoffs. \ncontinuedonpage2 \nRonald A.
