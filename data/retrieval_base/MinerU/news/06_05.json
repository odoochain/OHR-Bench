Trump found a 73-word provision in the asylum law that he said gave him “magical authorities” to keep migrants out of the country. \nPresident Biden turned to that same provision on Tuesday as he took executive action to temporarily close the border to asylum seekers, suspending longstanding guarantees that anyone who steps onto U.S. soil has the right to ask for protection in America. [Page A15.] \n“The simple truth is, there is a worldwide migrant crisis,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, “and if the United States doesn’t secure our border, there’s no limit to the number of people who may try to come here.” \nMr. Biden’s announcement is a stunning reversal for a president and a party that spent years arguing that America was a country of immigrants. When President Barack Obama wanted to shore up his chances of reelection in 2012, he issued a sweeping executive order on immigration — one that allowed millions of immigrants to stay in the country legally. \nA dozen years later, with the number of people crossing the border illegally at historic highs the next Democratic president moved entirely in the other direction. Critics say Mr. Biden is adopting the tactics of Mr. Trump and Stephen Miller, his immigration czar, to end asylum, even using the same clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act that Mr. Trump cited to justify a travel ban on Muslim countries. “Stephen Miller and Donald Trump peddled fear-based politics on immigration, and the Biden White House has decided to buy,” said Heidi Altman, the policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center. She called it “a dangerous shift” that will “put the United States at odds with core values and commitments.” \nPAUL RATJE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The Mexican National Guard near the border with Texas. \n\nContinued on Page A14 \nARIZONA Republicans have added a tough immigration measure to November’s ballot.

It is part of a broad election-year push by Democrats to highlight Republicans’ record of opposing abortion rights and other reproductive health choices that voters fear will be stripped away following the fall of Roe v. Wade. \n“The choice to use birth control should be yours and yours alone,” Representative Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, who has held abortion events with 11 members and candidates across the country, said at a news conference outside the Capitol. House Republicans, she said, “can put aside their MAGA ideology, join us, join the American people and get this bill passed. Or they can triple down on their anti-freedom extremism in full view of the American people.” \nThe move comes as Senate Democrats plan to force a vote this week on an identical contraceptive access bill, which Republicans are expected to block. The coordinated legislative push shows that Democrats regard access to abortion, contraception and reproductive health options as their strongest issues on which to draw a contrast with Republicans before the November elections. \nContinued on Page A10 \n# \nThis article is by Mujib Mashal, Alex Travelli, Hari Kumar, Suhasini Raj, Sameer Yasir and Pragati K.B. NEW DELHI — Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. \nIn an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. \nMr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority \n# \nmark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., gained far more seats than any other party. \nBut instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. \nAs the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. \nMr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. “We will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people.” For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that Continued on Page A8 \nATUL LOKE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will need to rely on his coalition partners to stay in power. ,\n# \nSPLIT ON WAR IN GAZA \nAllies Unite on Ukraine but Worry About U.S. Support for Israel \n# \n“Gaza undermines the moral clarity of the argument they want to make about Ukraine,” said Peter Beinart, a professor of journalism and politics at the City University of New York and a longtime analyst of Middle East affairs who has been critical of Israel’s government. “The Gaza war makes that story a lot less compelling to a lot of people.” \nThe series of meetings will put Mr. Biden in a position he has not experienced since becoming president: He will be embraced and isolated at the same time by the group of allies he has courted for nearly four years. For a president who has emphasized his support for America’s traditional alliances, it represents a challenge that will test his diplomatic skills in unfamiliar ways. \nBut he will also be defying the very same leaders and standing virtually alone among Western democracies still firmly in support of Israel as it wages war in Gaza. When Mr. Biden arrives in France for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, it will be his first time in Europe since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack led by Hamas, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and brought a military retaliation that has killed about 36,000 people in Gaza. Next week, he will return to Europe for a summit in Italy with the leaders of the Group of 7 nations, and three weeks after that he will host the 75th anniversary summit of NATO nations in Washington. \nPARIS — When President Biden lands in France on Wednesday, he will be rallying European leaders to his side and showcasing the resolve he has helped to foster on behalf of Ukraine. \nIvo Daalder, who was an ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama, acknowledged the tension in Mr. Biden’s approach. \n“Yes, it seems to be slightly contradictory to be making one argument on Russia and another argument on Israel,” said Mr. Daalder, who now serves as president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “But the situations are different. One was attacked, and the other did the attacking. It’s pretty big.” \nThe European allies, with a couple of notable exceptions, have been strongly aligned with Washington for more than two years in the multinational campaign to defeat Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, broadly matching American investments in the war with their own commitments to Kyiv. But the Europeans have grown increasingly critical of how Israel is conducting its operation in Gaza over the past nine months, even as the Biden administration has rejected efforts by the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal \nContinued on Page A5 \n# \nSAN FRANCISCO — A group of OpenAI insiders is blowing the whistle on what they say is a \nculture of recklessKEVIN ness and secrecy ROOSE caits tchoe  aSrtainfi cFiraalnTHE SHIFT intelligence company, which is   \nracing to build the most powerful   \nA.I. systems ever created.
