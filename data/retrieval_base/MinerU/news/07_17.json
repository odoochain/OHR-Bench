Trump was speaking on Saturday, three law enforcement snipers were positioned inside the same complex of buildings, looking for anything amiss in the crowd. \nThe director of the Secret Service said the local forces were in the same building, an account suggesting that the gunman was essentially on top of them. A local law enforcement official told The New York Times on Tuesday that was not the case, and that the local officers were in an adjacent building. \nThe discrepancy in their accounts is just one unsettled element in the effort to determine how security broke down and allowed a 20-year-old with a semiautomatic rifle to open fire in a rapid barrage that left Mr. Trump hurt, one man dead and two other people at the rally gravely wounded. \nThat this simple matter — whether law enforcement used the same building as the gunman — is still not easily resolved three days after the shooting shows that divisions are emerging among the law enforcement agencies after a would-be assassin came close to felling the Republican presidential nominee two days before the party’s convention. \nThe Secret Service director, Kimberly A. Cheatle, set off the back and forth in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday morning, her first public appearance since the assassination attempt. She said that local officers were inside the building used by the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., on Saturday evening. If so, that meant the gunman could have scaled a building even as snipers \nContinued on Page A14 \n# \nU.S. intelligence agencies detected a potential Iranian plot to kill the former president before Saturday’s shooting.

Trump’s most devoted supporters, the bullet that nicked his ear and came within inches of ending his life was only further proof that a higher power is looking out for him. \n“I don’t see this as luck,” said the Rev. Nathaniel Thomas, a Republican National Convention delegate and a pastor from the Washington, D.C., area. “I see this as God’s protection.” \nAfter he spent decades pursuing riches, fame and power, Mr. Trump’s life has been far from pi\n# \nous. Yet he has drawn a committed core of followers — many in Milwaukee this week for his nominating convention — who view him as handpicked by God for a second term in the White House. These supporters are less likely to explicitly compare him to Jesus and instead view him as the latest example of a morally flawed Old Testament hero, like Cyrus or David, who was ordained by the heavens to lead profound missions of good versus evil. Their passion for Mr. Trump has long transcended slogans on faded rally T-shirts or political bumper stickers, but now, it appears to be reaching new heights after the assassination attempt on Saturday. “Something’s got to be at play,” said Michael Thompson, the Republican chairman in Lee County, Fla., while looking toward the sky as if to invoke the heavens. “I don’t think the average person could withstand a tenth of what he has gone through. So yeah, I think he’s probably chosen at the right time in our country’s history.” \n\nSue Means, 73, a delegate from Continued on Page A14 \nParliament’s dysfunction has dented government credibility as Ukraine tries to reset its war effort. \n# \nKYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s Parliament is in a state of disarray. Under martial law, with the country at war, no elections are possible to replace members who switched jobs, joined the army, fled the country or quit. The Parliament regularly gathers with more than 10 percent of its lawmakers absent. \nThough legally obliged to attend hearings when summoned, \n# \n# \nministers sometimes do not show up, without repercussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s party, once a political juggernaut, has in effect lost its majority by unraveling into factions. To pass crucial bills, it is forced to rely on support from lawmakers who belonged to a now-banned pro-Russian party. \n\nThe overall picture, said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, is of a Parliament sidelined during the war and slipping from its once powerful role in Ukrainian democracy. \n“In a state of martial law, with our centralization of state management and the end of public politics, Parliament lost its influence,” Mr. Fesenko said. \nContinued on Page A8 \n# \nFirst U.S. Senator Convicted of Acting as Foreign Agent — He Vows Appeal \nThis article is by Benjamin Weiser, Tracey Tully, Nicholas Fandos and Maria Cramer. \nSenator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a powerful Democrat who once led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was convicted on Tuesday of participating in a vast international bribery scheme, in which prosecutors said he had accepted gold, cash and other payoffs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors abroad and at home. \nA Manhattan jury returned the verdict after deliberating for about 13 hours over three days in Federal District Court. Mr. Menendez was found guilty on all 16 counts he faced, including bribery, honest services wire fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and acting as an agent for Egypt. \nThe verdict made Mr. Menendez the first United States senator to be found guilty of acting as an agent of a foreign power and the seventh to be convicted of a federal crime while in office. \nMr. Menendez, 70, now faces the possibility of many years in prison when he is sentenced by the judge, Sidney H. Stein. Eight of the counts on which he was convicted carry potential 20-year sentences. The judge said he would sentence Mr. Menendez on Oct. 29. \nThe resounding verdict will almost certainly deliver a final blow to Mr. Menendez’s storied fourdecade political career and create intense pressure for him to leave office before his term expires at year’s end. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and majority leader, said in a statement, “In light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate and our country, and resign.” \nMr. Menendez had resisted calls to step down before his trial, but he could now face a rare expulsion vote by his Senate colleagues if he does not leave voluntarily. If the seat is vacated, Gov.

Trump, but has instead relied on Mike Donilon, a longtime friend, former pollster and Bidencampaign messaging guru, to summarize the numbers, with regular memos and numerous daily phone calls. \n\nThe ever-buzzing phone of Steve Ricchetti, a close counselor to Mr. Biden since his vice presidency, is the main conduit between concerned lawmakers and the president. \nMr. Biden speaks frequently to his son, Hunter Biden, who calls and texts the president and first lady multiple times a day to see how they are coping with the onslaught of scrutiny surrounding \nContinued on Page A17 \nWARNING Adam B.

Pernorio repeatedly mashed the call button at his bedside in the Heritage Hills nursing home in Rhode Island. A retired truck driver, he had injured his spine in a fall on the job decades earlier and could no longer walk. The antibiotics he was taking made him need to go to the bathroom frequently. But he could only get there if someone helped him into his wheelchair. \n“It was degrading,” said Mr. Pernorio, 79. “I spent 21 hours a day in bed.” \nBy the time an aide finally responded, he’d been lying in soiled briefs for hours, he said. It happened time and again. \nPayroll records show that during his stay at Heritage Hills, daily aide staffing levels were 25 percent below the minimums under state law. The nursing home said it provided high-quality care to all residents. Regardless, it wasn’t in trouble with the state, because Rhode Island does not enforce its staffing rule. \nAn acute shortage of nurses and aides in the nation’s nearly 15,000 nursing homes is at the root of many of the most disturbing shortfalls in care for the 1.2 million Americans who live in them, including many of the nation’s frailest old people. \nContinued on Page A18 \n\n# \nGazans Say Shelter Is Hit Two Israeli strikes killed more than 20 people, including at a former U.N. school housing displaced people, according to local health officials.
