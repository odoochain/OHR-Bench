Trump’s speech, at nytimes.com. \n# \nDrastic Cuts to Document as Veteran Team’s Ruthless Efficiency Limited Debate \nThis article is by Jonathan Swan, Shane Goldmacher and Maggie Haberman. \nDonald J. Trump long ago decided he wanted a very different Republican Party platform in 2024. The delegates who arrived in Milwaukee early last week before the Republican National Convention, with grand plans of drafting a sweeping document of party principles, quickly found out just how determined he was. \nWithin minutes of their arrival, their cellphones were confiscated and placed in magnetically sealed pouches. There would be no leaks of information. It was only then that the delegates received a copy of the platform language the Trump team had meticulously prepared, which slashed the platform size by nearly three-quarters. \n“This is something that ultimately you’ll pass,” Mr. Trump told the delegates by phone and made audible to the room, according to a person who was there and who was not authorized to speak publicly. “You’ll pass it quickly.” \nHe was right. Within hours, the platform committee had endorsed a document that Mr. Trump had personally dictated parts of, according to two people with direct knowledge of the events, and it all happened before the delegates got \nThe new platform softened language on abortion, excised old language referring obliquely to gay conversion therapy and culled a section about reducing a national debt that Mr. Trump had increased by nearly \\$8 trillion during his term in office. But the most revealing part was not any particular provision or plank. \ntheir phones back. The committee passed the platform by a vote of 84 to 18. \nIt was the ruthless efficiency of a process months in the making that squelched, silenced or steamrolled any forces who might oppose Mr. Trump. The result was the latest evidence of the political maturation of Mr. Trump and his operation. \nThe first years of Mr. Trump’s presidency were defined by obstruction. He was repeatedly redirected by advisers and rebuffed on Capitol Hill. But now, as he is about to formally accept the Republican Party’s nomination on Thursday in Milwaukee for the third consecutive campaign, Mr. Trump is a political veteran who has spent nearly 10 years grinding \nContinued on Page A17 \n# \n# \nShe Doubts He’ll Win and Fears Toll on Party \n# \nWASHINGTON — Nancy Pelosi is all about winning. Regarded by many as her party’s most ruthless tactician, she fought her way to the top of the Democratic leadership in the House, won the majority not once but twice and retained her speakership by putting down a rebellion from younger Democrats demanding she pass the torch to a new generation. And the former speaker is in no mood to start losing now, as evidence mounts that President Biden is staring at a major defea that could drag his party down with him. \nIn private conversations with Mr. Biden, colleagues and allies, Ms. Pelosi, the Californian who still wields tremendous influence in her party and is seen by many as key to resolving the status of Mr. Biden’s candidacy, has let it be known in the days since his disastrous debate performance that she is skeptical that the president can win. And his loss, she fears, could cost her party its chance to win back the House, potentially its only firewall against a second Donald J. Trump presidency. \nMs. Pelosi, according to those who have talked with her, conveyed those sentiments in phone calls with the president and with alarmed colleagues who have reached out to her for guidance on what to do. The former speaker is intimately familiar with the minutiae of campaigns from her years following House races district by district, and she has been marshaling her knowledge of the political map, polling \nContinued on Page A17 \nPIVOTAL MOMENT A Covid diagnosis throws images of both campaigns into sharp relief.

Shear, Peter Baker and Katie Rogers. \nWASHINGTON — Several people close to President Biden said on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race, bowing to the growing demands of many anxious members of his party. \nOne of the people close to him warned that the president had not yet made up his mind to leave the race after three weeks of insisting that almost nothing would drive him out. But another said that “re\nPresident Hasn’t Made Final Decision Yet — In Covid Isolation \nality is setting in,” and that it would not be a surprise if Mr. Biden made an announcement soon endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. \nThis account is based on interviews with four people close to the president, all of whom described the situation as extremely delicate and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid offending the president. Mr. Biden remained in isolation at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after being diagnosed with Covid on Wednesday. \n\nMany other Democrats more distant from the White House said expectations were rising within the party that the president would soon relent, a shift from just days ago when many were in despair about changing his mind. But there was also caution about reading signs from a president with an exceedingly small circle of confidants. \nThe latest Democratic defection to become public came from Continued on Page A19 \n# \n# \n# \nBob Newhart, who burst onto the comedy scene in 1960 working a stammering Everyman character not unlike himself, then rode essentially that same character through a long, busy career that included two of television’s most memorable sitcoms, died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 94. \nHis publicist, Jerry Digney, confirmed the death. Mr. Newhart wasn’t merely un\n# \nknown a few months before his emergence as a full-fledged star; he was barely in the business, though he had aspirations. In 1959, some comic tapes he had made to amuse himself while working as an accountant in Chicago caught the ear of an executive at Warner Bros. Records, \n\nABC PHOTO ARCHIVES/DISNEY GENERAL ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT, VIA GETTY IMAGES Bob Newhart, an accountant, was 30 when he broke into comedy. \nHe won two other Grammys that year as well, for best new artist and best spoken-word comedy performance, an honor that was given not to his first album but to his second, a hastily made followup titled “The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!” For a while, his first two albums occupied the top two spots on the Billboard album chart. \nwhich in 1960 released the comedy album “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.” \nThe record shot to No. 1 on the charts, and at the 1961 Grammy Awards it improbably captured the top prize, album of the year. Among the nominees Mr. Newhart bested: Nat King Cole, Harry Belafonte and Frank Sinatra. \n“Playboy magazine hailed me ‘the best new comedian of the decade,’” Mr. Newhart wrote in his autobiography, “I Shouldn’t Even Be Doing This: And Other Things That Strike Me as Funny” (2006), describing this period. “Of course, there were still nine more years left in the decade.” \nUnlike many entertainers who achieve fame almost overnight, Mr. Newhart was able to handle the unexpected success of the “Button-Down Mind” albums.

It’s because she does not hew to the very specific mold of femininity that has become the norm in the world of Trump. \nAfter all, there is a certain kind of look that the women in Mr. Trump’s closest orbit — his wife, daughters and daughters-in-law — all share, and that has become a defining gender trope in his own political reality show. \n\nIt involves a lot of hair, often left to cascade in glossy, carefully controlled Breck Girl waves. It involves heavy mascara (or false eyelashes), lip gloss and vertiginous heels. It often involves a brightly colored sheath dress. It calls to mind a cross between a Miss America — or Miss Universe — pageant contestant and a Fox newscaster. It is the equivalent of the Palm Beach billionaire take on the trad wife (even if these wives also have work). It looks as if it requires a lot of effort to maintain. \nSee, for example, one Trump family speaker, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of Donald Trump Jr. Ms. Guilfoyle took to the stage to rouse the crowd in a scarlet dress and spike heels, brown hair flowing down to frame her heavily made-up face Continued on Page A14 \n\nDOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES Usha Vance stood out at the Republican National Convention. \n# \n# \n# \nMore Gas Trucks, Fewer E.V.s Ford will build large pickups at a Canadian factory it had previously scheduled to produce electric vehicles.
