Mr. Biden “booted Netanyahu out of the closet of ambiguity and presented Netanyahu’s proposal Continued on Page A6 \nJERUSALEM — For months, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has refused to offer a timeline for ending the war against Hamas in Gaza, a stance his critics see as a political tactic. But he has been put on the spot by President Biden’s announcement outlining a proposal for a truce. \nCritics of the prime minister have portrayed him as indecisive and say there are two Netanyahus. One, they say, functions pragmatically in the small war cabinet he formed with some centrist rivals, to give it public legitimacy. The other is effectively being held hostage by the far-right members of his governing coalition, who oppose any concession to Hamas and who ensure his political survival. \nMr. Netanyahu, a conservative, has long juggled competing personal, political and national interests. He now appears to be facing a stark choice between the survival of his hard-line, hawkish government and bringing home hostages held in Gaza while setting himself and Israel on a new course away from growing international isolation. \nOn Friday, Mr. Biden outlined broad terms that he said were presented by Israel to the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators who have been pushing for a deal to pause the fighting and free hostages in Gaza. Israeli officials confirmed that the terms matched a cease-fire proposal that had been approved by Israel’s war cabinet but not yet presented to the Israeli public. \nELLIOT ROSS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \nThe state, spurred by climate change, has made it harder to expand highways, and transportation officials are turning eyes and money to public transit.

A total of 54 House members, or \nWASHINGTON — At some point during a routine seven-hour trip from his Oregon district to Washington, Representative Earl Blumenauer, 75, a Democrat who has served in Congress for almost three decades, experienced a depressing epiphany. \n# \nabout one-eighth of the total body, will not be seeking another term this November. \nAs a matter of sheer numbers, the exodus is not history-making. What is striking are the names on the list. There are rising stars, seasoned legislators and committee chairs. But not a single bombthrower. \nFor three of the 54, the issue was forced: one by expulsion (George Santos, the Long Island Republican) and two by being gerrymandered out of winnable districts (Representatives Wiley Nickel and Kathy Manning, both North Carolina Democrats). Two others died (Donald M. Payne Jr., of New Jersey, and A. Donald McEachin of Virginia, both Democrats). \n\nAnother 18 members vacated their seats to seek a different elective office. That leaves 31 members — 19 Republicans and 12 Democrats, 20 of whom were interviewed for this article — who have decided to leave the House of their own volition, with no electoral pressure to do so. \n“It’s a shocking number,” said one of them, Representative Patrick T. McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who was first Continued on Page A11 \n# \n# \nBEELITZ, Germany — In the past month, millions of people have found themselves stumbling through the contorted and catchy syllables of a song about, of all things, a woman named Barbara and some rhubarb-loving barbarians who drink beer while getting their beards barbered. In German. \nOr more rightly: Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier. \nThe hyper-compound words of the popular German tongue twister about Barbara, her “bombastic” rhubarb cake and her hirsute customers shot to inexplicable and extreme popularity this spring, a few months after a pair of comedic musical content creators from Berlin posted a rap version late last year. Their silly ditty has more than 47 million views on TikTok; for a brief moment on some online streaming charts, Barbara beat out Beyoncé. Beyoncé. \n“There is a prejudice that, first, Germans don’t have any sense of humor, and second, they do not have fun, and third, their language sounds very aggressive,” said Bodo Wartke, the rap’s lyricist who, along with Marti Fischer, the composer, created the viral “Barbara’s Rhubarb Bar” tune. They spoke on a recent day in their \nLENA MUCHA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES A German song captured the nation’s springtime fixation on rhubarb, strawberries and asparagus. \nBerlin studio as they giggled and tripped over their own stanzas — which exploit a feature of German grammar that crams nouns together into strings of syllables. “And we proved them all wrong,” Mr. Wartke said. But lost in translation, as global copycats stumble through the alliterative story of Barbara, the bar she opens and the pie that made her famous, is a quirk not only of language, but also of German gastronomical culture. Rhubarb is much more than a word in German that sounds a lot like “Barbara”; it is an object of springtime Continued on Page A9 \n\n\n# \n# \nFounders Saw Peril of Unchecked Power \n# \nWASHINGTON — The revolutionary hero Patrick Henry knew this day would come. He might not have anticipated all the particulars, such as the porn actress in the hotel room and the illicit payoff to keep her quiet. But he feared that eventually a criminal might occupy the presidency and use his powers to thwart anyone who sought to hold him accountable. “Away with your president,” he declared, “we shall have a king.” \nThat was exactly what the founders sought to avoid, having thrown off the yoke of an allpowerful monarch. But as hard as they worked to establish checks and balances, the system they constructed to hold wayward presidents accountable has ultimately proved to be unsteady. Whatever rules Americans thought were in place are now being rewritten by Donald J. Trump, the once and perhaps future president who has already shattered many barriers and precedents. The notion that 34 felonies is not automatically disqualifying and a convicted criminal can be a viable candidate for commander in chief upends two and a half centuries of assumptions about American democracy. \nAnd it raises fundamental questions about the limits of power in a second term, should \nMr. Trump be returned to office. If he wins, it means he will have survived two impeachments, four criminal indictments, civil judgments for sexual abuse and business fraud, and a felony conviction. Given that, it would be hard to imagine what institutional deterrents could discourage abuses or excesses. \nMoreover, the judiciary may not be the check on the executive branch that it has been in the past. If no other cases go to trial before the election, it could be another four years before the courts could even consider whether the newly elected president jeopardized national security or illegally sought to overturn the 2020 election, as he has been charged with doing. As it is, even before the election, the Supreme Court may grant Mr. Trump at least some measure of immunity. \nMr. Trump would still have to operate within the constitutional system, analysts point out, but he has already shown a willingness to push its boundaries. When he was president, he claimed that the Constitution gave him “the right to do whatever I want.” \nAfter leaving office, he advocated “termination” of the Constitution to allow him to return to power right away without anContinued on Page A17 \n# \n# \nHis felony conviction on Thursday, delivered by a jury of 12 Manhattan residents, brought with it the possibility that he could eventually be imprisoned in New York, a far cry from the image he spent decades cultivating as a real estate mogul and man about town.

Trump’s playground, the place where he made his name and then plastered it everywhere he could. Now, the city that helped make him rich and famous has become his battleground. And Mr. Trump keeps losing. \nHis conviction last week was the third and heaviest blow the former president has been dealt in his erstwhile hometown this year — a series of challenges to his ego, his bottom line, and now, perhaps, his freedom. \n\nADAM GRAY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Donald Trump lost three court cases in New York this year. \nLetitia James, for overvaluing his net worth.

Trump’s felony conviction in New York. \nA year ago, the younger Mr. Biden seemed unlikely to go to trial on the weapons charges he was facing over a firearms application that prosecutors say was falsified, or from more serious charges of failing to pay taxes from overseas business activities when he was using drugs and alcohol heavily and spending lavishly. \nStill, it is the son — not the father — who will be on trial twice during an election year.

The judge in the case punched holes in the agreement, to the delight of Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress who tried to scuttle that deal and have portrayed Hunter Biden’s legal problems as equivalent to those of their party’s 2024 presidential candidate in an effort to impeach President Biden. \n\n# \nFamily Farms Getting a Hand The Biden administration aims to support small farmers with subsidies while still aiding big operations.
