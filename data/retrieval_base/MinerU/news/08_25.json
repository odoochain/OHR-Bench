Barnes and Adam Goldman. \nWASHINGTON — In January, Israeli and American officials thought they had caught a break in the hunt for one of the world’s most wanted men. \nIsraeli commandos raided an elaborate tunnel complex in the southern Gaza Strip on Jan. 31 based on intelligence that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, was hiding there, according to American and Israeli officials. \nHe had been, it turned out. But Mr. Sinwar had left the bunker beneath the city of Khan Younis just days earlier, leaving behind documents and stacks of Israeli shekels totaling the equivalent of about \\$1 million. The hunt went on, with a dearth of hard evidence on his whereabouts. \n\nSince the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel that he planned and directed, Mr. Sinwar has been something of a ghost: never appearing in public, rarely releasing messages for his followers and giving few clues about where he might be. \nHe is by far Hamas’s most important figure, and his success in evading capture or death has denied Israel the ability to make a foundational claim: that it has won the war and eradicated Ha\n# \nmas in a conflict that has decimated the group’s ranks but also destroyed the Gaza Strip and killed tens of thousands of civilians. \nU.S. and Israeli officials said Mr. Sinwar abandoned electronic communications long ago, and he has avoided a sophisticated intelligence dragnet. He is believed to stay in touch with the organization he leads through a network of human couriers. How that system works remains a mystery. \nIt is a playbook used by Hamas leaders in the past, and by other terrorist leaders like Osama bin Laden. And yet Mr. Sinwar’s situation is more complex, and even more frustrating to American and Israeli officials. \nUnlike bin Laden in his last years, Mr. Sinwar is actively managing a military campaign. Diplomats involved in cease-fire negotiations in Doha, Qatar, say that Hamas representatives insist they need Mr. Sinwar’s input before they make major decisions. As the most respected Hamas leader, he is the only person who can ensure that whatever is decided in Doha is implemented in Gaza. \nContinued on Page 9 \n# \n# \nNASHVILLE — Less than 10 minutes had passed before Daniel Diermeier, Vanderbilt University’s chancellor, told hundreds of new students what the school would not do. \nThe university would not divest from Israel. It would not banish provocative speakers. \nIt would not issue statements in support or condemnation of Israeli or Palestinian causes. \nBefore the hour was up on Monday, he added that Vanderbilt would not tolerate threats, harassment or protests “disrupting the learning environment.” \nThis month, Vanderbilt required all first-year undergraduate students to attend mandatory meetings about the university’s approach to free speech, with the hope that clear expectations — and explanations for them — would help administrators keep order after protests rocked American campuses toward the end of the last academic year. \n“The chaos on campuses is because there’s lack of clarity on these principles,” Dr. Diermeier said in an interview. \nThere is no guarantee that the pre-emptive, plain-spoken meetings will work. Many student activists and professors at Vanderbilt have condemned the universi$\\mathrm{ty}\\mathrm{s}$ rules as suppressing their speech, and even universities with histories of hard-nosed tac\nContinued on Page 17 \n\nJUN MICHAEL PARK FOR THE NEW YORK TIME \nho Seong-hoan said he envies the honeybees that can zigzag into North Korea from his farm. \n# \n# \nCIVILIAN CONTROL ZONE, South Korea — Cho Seong-hoan’s father liked to say that the honeybees on his farm were lucky. Unlike typical South Koreans, they could cross into North Korea, as he had done before war divided the peninsula. \n“I also really envy them,” Mr. Cho, 59, said over the drone of bees on a searing summer morning at the family farm he took over when his father died in 2022. He was sitting about half a mile from \nMr. Cho is one of roughly two dozen South Korean honeybee farmers working in a six-milewide patchwork of rice paddies, forests, graveyards and firing ranges beside the 71-year-old DMZ. The area is known as the Civilian Control Zone and is heavily militarized and closed to most civilians. \nthe Demilitarized Zone, the 155- mile-long strip of land separating the Koreas that is littered with land mines and sealed by razorwire fences. \nThe work hasn’t made them rich, but the honey tastes great, thanks largely to the area’s exceptional biodiversity. \n\nSome of the farmers are motivated by something that transcends business. In a land where a 1953 armistice divided many Korean families for generations, they are seeking closure for wartime traumas that have never quite healed. \nMr. Cho’s ancestral village in the western part of the zone was evacuated during the war and abandoned. It is now subsumed \nContinued on Page 5 \n# \n# \nPolitical Core Defined by His Conversion \nMEASURES IN 10 STATES \n# \nCINCINNATI — From his new home in Cincinnati, JD Vance would go to St. Gertrude to meet the friar. \nG.O.P. Digs In to Try to Stop Winning Streak Since End of Roe \nIt was a fitting place for the millennial aspiring politician, who was drawn to the Roman Catholic Church’s ancient ways. For years he had flirted with joining the church. Now he wanted to explore the desire in earnest. \nMr. Vance would meet with Father Henry Stephan. For months, they read works of theology, mysticism, and political and moral philosophy. Sometimes they went to coffee or lunch. It was bespoke private instruction, a hallmark of Dominicans who are known for their lives of intellect and study. Then, one summer day in 2019, Mr. Vance, then 35, returned to St. Gertrude, this time to be baptized and receive his first communion in the Dominicans’ private chapel. The friars hosted a celebratory reception for his family with doughnuts. He chose as his patron Saint Augustine, the political theologian whose fifth-century treatise “City of God” challenged Rome’s ruling class and drew Mr. Vance to the faith. \nSt. Gertrude Church was led by the Dominican Friars from the Province of St. Joseph, part of a religious order founded in 1216. Its sanctuary smelled of incense but felt modern, its concrete walls pierced with bright stained-glass rectangles in reds and blues. \n“It was the best criticism of our modern age I’d ever read,” Mr. Vance later explained in a Catholic literary journal. “A society oriented entirely towards consumption and pleasure, spurning duty and virtue.” \nMuch has been made of Mr. Vance’s very public conversion to Trumpism, and his seemingly mutable political stances. But his quieter, private conversion to Catholicism, occurring over a similar stretch of years, reveals some core values at the heart of his personal and political philosophy and their potential impact on the country. \nBecoming Catholic for Mr. Vance, who was loosely raised as an evangelical, was a practical Continued on Page 14 \n# \nBallot measures on abortion rights have succeeded beyond what even their proponents imagined when the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. \nNow the strategy — and an unbroken winning streak — faces its biggest test ever, with 10 states asking voters whether to establish a right to abortion in their constitutions. On Friday, Nebraska became the final state to certify — it will be the only state with two measures, one sponsored by abortion rights supporters and the other by opponents. \nThey have not only enshrined a constitutional right to abortion and restored access to the procedure in red and purple states. They have also converted what had been a voter mobilization advantage for Republicans into one for Democrats. \nDemocrats, coming out of a convention where they highlighted reproductive rights like never before, are counting on the measures across the country to both expand abortion access and help them win in battlegrounds for the presidential race and control of the House and Senate, with key races in states including Arizona, Nevada and Montana. \nAnd while voters have sided with abortion rights in all seven states where the question has appeared on the ballot since Roe’s reversal, this year’s map poses far steeper challenges, with citizensponsored abortion rights measures in five red states, two with near-total bans and all with aggressive opposition from Republican governors, courts or legislatures. \nThe ballot amendment in Florida alone will pose a test no other abortion proposal has faced: State law sets the threshold for passage at 60 percent, rather than a simple majority. In other red states, abortion rights groups have won with \nContinued on Page 18 \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — Jasmine Banks’s disillusionment started with a credit card bill. \nShe was proudly, fervently dedicated to the radical mission of the nonprofit where she worked, that police everywhere should be abolished. She reported to the group’s founder, a charismatic activist with a compelling life story: His fiancé had been killed by an abusive cop. She believed their nonprofit would show the world it did not need law enforcement. \nThen her boss went on vacation, and left her, as deputy director, in charge.

Why would he do that? \n“He knows we’re running out of money,” Ms. Banks remembered thinking. \nShe dug deeper into the nonprofit’s bank records and found much more that concerned her.
