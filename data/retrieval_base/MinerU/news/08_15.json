The Republican Party of the post-Roe era is sidelining anti-abortion activists. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint with innovative abortion bans, has been disavowed by Donald J. Trump. And the new G.O.P. party platform even promises to advance access to in vitro fertilization. \nBut as Mr. Trump distances himself from the anti-abortion revolution his own administration ushered in, a powerful battalion of conservative Christians has pushed ahead. In recent months, they have quietly laid the groundwork for their fight to restrict not only access to abortion but also to I.V.F. \nThey are planting seeds for their ultimate goal of ending abortion from conception, both within the Republican Party and beyond it. They face a tough political battle since their positions are largely unpopular and do not reflect majority opinion, particularly on I.V.F. \nAs they see it, their challenge stretches across generations, not simply a single political cycle. And their approach — including controlling regulatory language, state party platforms and the definition of when life begins — reflects an incremental strategy similar to the one activists used for decades to eventually overturn Roe v. Wade. \n“I expect there will be steps backwards as well as what we are working toward, which are long strikes forward,” said R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., who has been newly mobilizing evangelicals against I.V.F. \nhe fall of Roe itself was far Continued on Page A18 \n# \n# \nWhen people suffer severe brain damage $-$ as a result of car crashes, for example, or falls or aneurysms — they may slip into a coma for weeks, their eyes closed, their bodies unresponsive. \nSome recover, but others enter a mysterious state: eyes open, yet without clear signs of consciousness. Hundreds of thousands of such patients in the United States alone are found to be in a vegetative state or minimally conscious. They may survive for decades without regaining a connection to the outside world. \nThese patients pose an agonizing mystery both for their families and for the medical professionals \n# \nwho care for them. Even if they can’t communicate, might they still be aware? \nA large study published on Wednesday suggests that a quarter of them are. \nTeams of neurologists at six research centers asked 241 unresponsive patients to spend several minutes at a time doing complex cognitive tasks, such as imagining themselves playing tennis. Twenty-five percent of them responded with the same patterns of brain activity seen in healthy people, suggesting that they were able to think and at least somewhat aware. \n\nDr. Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and an author of the study, said the study shows that up to 100,000 patients in the United States alone might have some level of consciousness despite their devastating injuries. \nThe results should lead to more sophisticated exams of people Continued on Page A16 \nA.I.

When she begins to roll out her policy vision this week, Ms. Harris is likely to answer only some of those questions. \n\nDuring an economy-focused speech on Friday in Raleigh, N.C., Ms. Harris will outline a sort of reboot of the administration’s economic agenda, according to four people familiar with Ms. Harris’s plans. \n# \nShe will lay out an approach relatively light on details, they said. It will shift emphasis from Mr. Biden’s focus on job creation and made-in-America manufacturing, and toward efforts to rein in the cost of living. But it will rarely break from Mr. Biden on substance. \n\nThat strategy reflects the advice economic aides have given Ms. Harris: to be clear and bold in talking about the economy, but not overly specific. \nHer ability to do that has been effectively enabled by the unusual circumstances of Mr. Biden’s Continued on Page A12 \n# \n# \nIncursion Was Surprise to Enemy and Allies \nMILITARY’S GOALS MET\nThis article is by Kim Barker, Anton Troianovski, Andrew E.

Flags with the country’s signature three horizontal stripes of white, blue and red. A Pyatyorochka supermarket. \nIn the Russian town of Sverdlikovo, a Ukrainian soldier climbed onto another’s shoulders, broke off the wooden post anchored to a town council building and threw the Russian flag to the ground. In Daryino, a town five miles to the west, other soldiers also grabbed a Russian flag. “Just throw it away,” a Ukrainian soldier said, grinning, as another flexed his muscles. \nThe soldiers posting the videos, verified by The New York Times, were Ukrainian, almost giddily showing off just how easily they had pushed over the border and through Russian lines of defense in the past week. \nOn Aug. 6, Ukraine launched an audacious military offensive, planned and executed in secrecy, with the aim of upending the dynamics of a war it has appeared to be losing, town by town, as Russian troops have ground forward in the east. The operation surprised even Kyiv’s closest allies, including the United States, and has pushed the limits of how Western military equipment would be permitted to be used inside Russian territory. \nFor Russia, it was a moment nearly as shocking as the mercenary Yevgeny V. Prigozhin’s march on Moscow in June 2023: the vaunted security state that President Vladimir V. Putin had built crumbled in the face of the surprise attack, failing in its basic task of protecting its citizens. And the unwritten social contract that has largely accompanied Mr. Putin’s 30-month campaign — that most Russians could get on with their normal lives even as he waged war — was cast into question anew. \nMostly on the defensive since a failed counteroffensive last year, Ukraine has pushed seven miles into Russia along a 25-mile front and taken dozens of Russian soldiers as prisoners, analysts and Russian officials say. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region said on Monday that Ukraine controlled 28 towns and villages there. More than 132,000 people have been evacuated from nearby areas, Russian officials said. \nThis article is by Helene Cooper, Julian E. Barnes, Eric Schmitt and Adam Rasgon. \nIn many respects, Israel’s military operation has done far more damage against Hamas than U.S. officials had predicted when the war began in October. \nWASHINGTON — Israel has achieved all that it can militarily in Gaza, according to senior American officials, who say continued bombings are only increasing risks to civilians while the possibility of further weakening Hamas has diminished. \nWith the Biden administration racing to get cease-fire negotiations back on track, a growing number of national security officials across the government said that the Israeli military had severely set back Hamas but would never be able to completely eliminate the group. \nIsraeli forces can now move freely throughout Gaza, the officials said, and Hamas is bloodied and damaged. Israel has destroyed or seized crucial supply routes from Egypt into Gaza. About 14,000 combatants in Gaza have been killed or captured, the Israeli military said last month.

Biden Jr. visited San Francisco as a freshly minted senator and single father in the early 1970s, it was a well-known local fund-raiser and stay-at-home mother of five, Nancy Pelosi, who lent him her Jeep to get around town. \nOver the next five decades, the two old-school Catholic Democrats who grew up in the era of Elvis Presley and were inspired by the election of the country’s first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy, cultivated a natural friendship. \nThey discovered that they both carried rosaries in their pockets. They learned how to wield power in Washington as leaders of toptier congressional committees: the House Intelligence and Appropriations Committees for her, the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees for him. \n\nThat was then. In July, Ms. Pelosi began pushing for Mr. Biden to exit the presidential race, and the two have not spoken since he made the difficult decision to step aside. There are multiple reports that Mr. Biden is angry with her. (On Wednesday, a person close to him said he was “unhappy” with the way things went.) \nIn May, at the twilights of their long careers, Mr. Biden, 81, awarded Ms. Pelosi, 84, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, anointing her the “greatest speaker of the House of Representatives in history.” \nMs. Pelosi has been making the rounds on a book tour, which has Continued on Page A15 \n\n# \nJapan’s Leader Stepping Down Fumio Kishida, whose popularity as prime minister was never high, bowed to pressure within his party.
