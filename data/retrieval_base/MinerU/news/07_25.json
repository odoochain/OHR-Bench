The vice president had assembled her team so that the exact moment Mr. Biden formally quit, at 1:46 p.m. — one minute after the president had informed his own senior staff $-$ they were ready to go. \nTime was of the essence. A sprawling call list of the most important Democrats to reach had been prepared in advance, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The vice president, in sneakers and a sweatshirt, began methodically dialing Democratic power brokers. \n“I wasn’t going to let this day go by without you hearing from me,” Ms. Harris had said over and over, as day turned to night, according to five people who received her calls or were briefed on them. \nShe phoned past Democratic presidents, many of her potential rivals — including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania — the Democratic congressional leaders, Senator Bernie Sanders, the heads of the various influential caucuses and other top Democrats, a person \nContinued on Page A15 \n\nERIN SCHAFF/THE NEW YORK TIMES Vice President Kamala Harris in Indianapolis on Wednesday. \nRUNNING MATE Democrats are having fun again amid talk of filling the No. 2 spot.

His tone was wistful and his speech was an early farewell. \n“It’s been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,” he said. \nWASHINGTON — President Biden told the American public in an Oval Office address on Wednesday that he had abandoned his re-election campaign because there is “a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices — yes, younger voices.” \nSitting behind the Resolute Desk and surrounded by photos of his family, Mr. Biden ticked through the accomplishments of his term, ranging from nominating the first Black woman to the Supreme Court to pulling the country out of a paralyzing pandemic. He expressed gratitude to the American people for allowing Continued on Page A13 \n# \n# \nThe heart of Paris has fallen silent in preparation for the opening ceremony on Friday, when a flotilla will usher thousands of athletes down the Seine, under the low-slung bridges where lovers like to linger. Not since the Covid-19 pandemic has the city been so still, or so constrained. \nPARIS — There is a glorious folly to the Paris Olympics, the first in the city since 1924, as if France in its perennial revolutionary ardor took a century to ponder something unimaginable, the transformation of a great city into a stadium. \nFrom the Pont d’Austerlitz in the east to the Pont Mirabeau in the west, roads are closed, newly built stands for spectators line the riverbanks, fences enclose sidewalks and residents need policeissued QR codes to reach their homes. The golden cherubs, nymphs and winged horses of the Pont Alexandre III gaze out on metal bleachers and posses of police. \nThe Olympic project is almost unthinkable in its audacity, and a major security headache, but then the Eiffel Tower would never have risen above Paris in 1889 if the many naysayers had prevailed. \n# \nAs it went up for the Paris World Fair, Guy de Maupassant called the tower a “giant hideous skeleton” that had driven him out of Paris. \nNow, between its first and second floors, five giant Olympic rings — in blue, yellow, black, green and red — adorn the tower. They glow at night over the Champ de Mars park, where the beach volleyball competition will be held. Nearby flows the Seine, beautified at a cost of about \\$1.5 billion and clean enough, it is said, for several Olympic events, including two 10-kilometer swims \n\nContinued on Page A6 \nJAMES HILL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The Marching 100 band from St. Augustine High School in New Orleans and the Eiffel Tower, with its illuminated Olympic rings. \n\n# \nADDRESSING CONGRESS \nFierce Speech Exposes Washington’s Deep Rifts Over Gaza \n# \nWASHINGTON — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday turned an address to Congress into a fullthroated defense of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. He cast it as a battle for the survival of the Jewish state while making almost no mention of the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in its drive to destroy Hamas. \nThe address laid bare deep divisions in Washington over the ninemonth war, whose toll on civilians has outraged many Democrats and drawn international condemnation. Dozens of Democrats did not show up, with some openly boycotting the speech. \nOutside the Capitol, pepper spray filled the air as police officers tried to push back thousands of protesters who had gathered to jeer Mr. Netanyahu. Demonstrators held signs calling him a war criminal, burned an effigy of him and an American flag and vandalized statues with anti-Israel slogans, including “Hamas is coming.” \nVice President Kamala Harris, the party’s presumptive presidential nominee who was campaigning in the Midwest, declined to preside in her capacity as president of the Senate alongside Speaker Mike Johnson, a break with tradition. \nIn a speech in which he condemned critics of the war as dupes aligning themselves with the world’s most dangerous actors or apologists for terrorists, Mr. Netanyahu portrayed the conflict as a proxy fight with Iran that must be won at all costs to protect both Israel and the United States. \n“When we fight Iran, we are fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the United States,” he said. \n“We’re not only protecting ourselves; we’re protecting you,” he added, emphasizing the alliance that has existed since Israel’s creation. He said nothing about the tensions in the relationship that have flared as Israel has used American weapons in attacks that Continued on Page A10 \n# \n# \nAs she climbed onto the windshield of her battered car — her makeshift stage — supporters jostled to touch her.
