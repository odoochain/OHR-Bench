This assured officials that a combination of high turnout among loyalists and suppressing the vote for the opposition would propel Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, to a presidential election victory. \n“We were calm,” Mr. Torrealba, a veteran lawmaker and a senior official of the ruling Socialist Party, said in an interview, describing the mood among government officials during the July 28 vote. “We did everything necessary to achieve a good victory.” \nWhat happened next appears to have delivered a seismic jolt to the government’s expectations. \nVote tallies showed that the ruling party’s supporters in the public sector and poor neighborhoods had abandoned the country’s leader in droves, according to vote tallies obtained by the opposition. \nAn electoral disaster loomed. “We were betrayed, because they said they were going to vote for Maduro and what did they do? They voted for the lady,” said a rul\nContinued on Page A10 \n# \n# \nPARIS — Lilibet speaks good English. Her coach is British and amply tattooed. She competed on Tuesday in park skateboarding, an insurgent sport in which the point among the sisterhood of athletes is not just winning a medal but embodying a mantra of female empowerment. \nLilibet is just a nickname. Her full name is Zheng Haohao, and at 11 she is the youngest athlete at the Olympic Games. She is also the new face of a Chinese sportsindustrial complex that for dec\n# \nades has harnessed tens of thousands of small children in hopes of forging a tiny fraction of them into Olympic champions. \nYet Lilibet’s debut, along with those of a few other Chinese Olympians, has come in large part because she has grown up outside the state’s full embrace. \n“I don’t want to put any pressure on myself,” Lilibet wrote on Chinese social media before her competition. “I just want to show my best in Paris.” \nLilibet’s carefree attitude, an energy tonic for Chinese fans at these Games, has prompted questions of whether it’s worth pushing Chinese athletes so hard for national glory. \nIn Paris, China is once again locked in a gold-medal race with the United States — a contest that probably means more to Beijing than to Washington.

Page A7. \n# \nThis article is by Sydney Ember, Jordyn Holman and Julie Creswell. \nThe economy’s resurgence from the pandemic shock has had a singular driving force: the consumer. Flush with savings and buoyed by a sizzling labor market, Americans have spent exuberantly, on goods such as furniture and electronics and then on services including air travel and restaurant meals. \nHow long this spending will hold up has become a crucial question. \n\nDespite contortions in world markets, many economists are cautioning that there is no reason to panic — at least not yet. In July, there was a notable slowdown in hiring and a jump in the unemployment rate to its highest level since October 2021, but consumer spending has remained relatively robust. Wages are rising, though at a slower rate, and job cuts are still low. \n“Overall, there isn’t evidence of \n# \na retrenchment in consumer spending,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at the consulting firm EY-Parthenon. The strength of spending helped power greaterthan-expected economic growth in the spring. \nThat could change if the labor market’s slowdown accelerates. Already, some consumers, especially those with lower incomes, are feeling the dual pinch of higher prices and elevated interest rates that are weighing on their finances. Credit card delinquencies are rising, and household debt has swelled. Pandemicera savings have dwindled. In June, Americans saved just 3.4 percent of their after-tax income, compared with 4.8 percent a year \n\nContinued on Page A16 \n# \nA Swing-State Plan, Selection by Harris Clad in Plain Talk Offers a Contrast and Carhartt on the Ballot \n# \nIn selecting Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris has picked a partner who is many things she is not: a prod\nT-shirt and camo hat. A white guy who exudes Midwestern dad energy. \nAnd, perhaps most important, a politician who has had to rely on the support of independent, or even Republican, voters to win elections. \n# \nuct of small-town America. A union member known to campaign in a \nTheir pairing is somewhat predictable; a cardinal rule of vice-presidential selection is to construct the ticket with political balance in mind. But it is also a statement about what many Democrats believe is one of Ms. Harris’s key vulnerabilities: that she is perceived as too liberal, putting even the small slice of rural, working-class and moderate voters that she needs across Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan out of her reach. Ms. Harris, a California Democrat, has never won an election as a solo candidate outside the liberal bastion of California, where races often hinge not on winning swing voters but on successfully navigating intraparty fights. That has left her with limited experience acquiring a political skill Mr. Walz honed over his nearly two decades in politics: talking to conservatives. \nThe great dream of Ms. Harris’s pick is that Mr. Walz’s brand of affable cultural politics can help broaden her appeal and win back some of the voters who have been fleeing the party for years. \n“This is a man who is as comfortable walking into Farm Fest in southern Minnesota and talking to corn and soybean growers as he is walking into a Black church in north Minneapolis,” said Senator Tina Smith, the Minnesota Democrat. “He is a person who just knows how to sit down and listen and connect with people.” \nIn other words, Democrats hope that “Brat summer,” the lime green, pop-culture meme for Ms. Harris’s campaign, can translate into the kind of brat summer that evokes a staple of Midwest barbecues. \nBut Republicans are not going to let Mr. Walz’s casual style and Continued on Page A14 \n# \nST. PAUL, Minn. — Tim Walz never attended an Ivy League school. He never wrote a political memoir. He once worked at a tanning bed factory in Jonesboro, Ark. And until he was 40, he never showed much interest in a career in politics. \nMr. Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate on Tuesday, had not devoted his life to reaching this pinnacle. \nIn selecting Mr. Walz, Ms. Harris has picked a one-man rejoinder to the idea that the Democrats are the party of the cultural and coastal elite. His biography and his style are a sharp contrast not only to Ms. Harris, who is from Califor\nCAROLINE YANG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has displayed shrewd instincts. \n\nSince turning to politics, Mr. Walz has used this biography to his political advantage, and it was no small part of what drew Ms. Harris to Mr. Walz, who until weeks ago was virtually unknown to most Democrats. With his broad smile and unpolished style, it was the Minnesota governor — more than any other Democrat — who was able to conceive and deliver Democrats’ new favorite attack on Mr. Trump and his party: \nnia, but also to former President Donald J. Trump, a New York billionaire, and to some degree to Mr. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who graduated from Yale Law School (and wrote a best-selling memoir). \nMr. Walz has led a life that stands out in the top echelon of American politics: a tableau filled with scenes of farming, turkey hunting, weekends of National Guard duty, public schools and coaching the local high school football team to a state championship. \nContinued on Page A13 \n# \n# \nFirst it was a tax cut for hotel and restaurant workers in Nevada, a swing state where Donald J. Trump proposed exempting tips from taxes. Then, in front of powerful chief executives gathered in Washington, Mr. Trump floated cutting the corporate tax rate, helping to ease concerns in the business community about his candidacy. \nNow Mr. Trump is calling for an end to taxing Social Security benefits, which could be a boon for retirees, one of the most politically important groups in the United States. \nRepeatedly during the campaign, Mr. Trump and Republicans have embraced new, sometimes novel tax cuts in an attempt to shore up support with major constituencies. In a series of social-media posts, at political rallies, and without formal policy proposals, Mr. Trump has casually suggested reducing federal revenue by trillions of dollars. \n\nWhile policy experts have taken issue with the ideas, Mr. Trump’s pronouncements have real political appeal, at times putting Democrats on their back foot. Nevada’s two Democratic senators and its powerful culinary union have endorsed ending taxes on tips. The AARP supports tax relief for seniors receiving Social Security benefits, though it has not taken a position on Mr. Trump’s proposal. “You do have to scratch your head a little bit when someone’s going around offering free lunches everywhere,” said Jesse Lee, a Democratic consultant and former Biden White House offi\nContinued on Page A15 \n\n# \nAstronauts May Fly on SpaceX NASA officials admitted that problems with Boeing’s Starliner were more serious than first thought, and they are exploring a backup option.
