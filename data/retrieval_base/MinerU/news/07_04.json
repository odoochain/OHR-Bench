Who will scold the children now and push them to go to school?” Mr. Kumar wailed at the feet of his wife. \nBut he couldn’t afford to be entirely lost in grief yet. The body of his mother was yet to be found. He bent over to pick up his daughter for one last embrace. Bhumi wore a yellow top, and her hair was tied in a ponytail with a pink band. \n\n“Let her sleep,” Nitin, Mr. Kumar’s oldest son, told him, pulling the girl away from his father to lay her back on the slab so they could continue the search. \n“I don’t know when I will find my mother’s body,” he said, moving on with the search. “I want to do their last rites together.” \nMr. Kumar’s mother, Jaimanti, was the family’s matriarch. And she was its main devotee to the guru, keeping his posters at home and frequenting his sermons. \nContinued on Page A6 \n\nThousands Evacuate California Fire A wildfire that began Tuesday north of Sacramento has burned more than 3,000 acres.

But it was entirely in character for Mr. Starmer, a 61- year-old former human rights lawyer who still behaves less like a politician than a prosecutor bringing a case. \nEarnest, intense, practical and not brimming with charisma, Mr. Starmer finds himself on the cusp of a potential landslide victory without the star quality that marked previous British leaders on the doorstep of power, whether Margaret Thatcher, the 1980s free-market champion, or Tony Blair, the avatar of “Cool Britannia.” \nAnd yet Mr. Starmer has managed an arguably comparable political feat: Less than a decade after entering Parliament, and less than five years after his party suffered its worst election defeat since the 1930s, he has remade Labour with ruthless efficiency into an electable party, pulling it to the center on key policies while capitalizing on the failings of three Conservative prime ministers. \n“Don’t forget what they have done,” Mr. Starmer told a rally in London on Saturday, pacing the stage in a pressed white shirt with sleeves rolled up. “Don’t forget party-gate, don’t forget the Covid contract, don’t forget the lies, don’t forget the kickbacks.” In listing this parade of Conservative scandals and crises, he brought the crowd of 350 to its Continued on Page A8 \n# \nOn All Sides, Most President Tells Allies Doubt Incumbent’s the Next Few Days Ability to Govern Will Be Critical \n# \nOverall, 74 percent of voters view him as too old for the job, up five percentage points since the debate.

We will follow our president’s lead,” she said. “We will fight, and we will win.” \nThe president sought to project confidence on Wednesday in a call with his campaign staff, even as White House officials were trying to calm nerves among the ranks inside the Biden administration. \n“No one’s pushing me out,” Mr. Biden said in the call. “I’m not leaving.” \nVice President Kamala Harris was also on the line. \nStill, Mr. Biden’s allies said that the president had privately acknowledged that his next few appearances heading into the July 4 holiday weekend must go well, particularly an interview scheduled for Friday with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News and campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \n“He knows if he has two more events like that, we’re in a different place” by the end of the weekend, said one of the allies, referring to Mr. Biden’s halting and unfocused performance in the debate. That person, who talked to the president in the past 24 hours, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation. \nA new poll from The New York Times and Siena College showed that former President Donald J. Trump now leads Mr. Biden 49 percent to 43 percent among likely voters nationally, a threepoint swing toward the Republican from just a week earlier, before the debate.
