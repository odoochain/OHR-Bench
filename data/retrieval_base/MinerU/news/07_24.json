PAGE A6 \nSuddenly, Mr. Trump faces a starkly different opponent: a vice president who is a Black woman, who is nearly 20 years younger, and who brings her own strengths and weaknesses but who adds new uncertainty into what had been a remarkably static race. \nAllies of Vice President Kamala Harris have already telegraphed that she will run a campaign framed around a “prosecutor versus felon” theme, highlighting her experience as a prosecutor and underscoring the fact that Mr. Trump has been indicted in multiple jurisdictions and convicted of 34 felonies. \nThe prosecutor-versus-felon approach may appeal to undecided voters who had been sour on both Mr. Trump and President Biden. It may also goad Mr. Trump, who reacts strongly to criticism, into resurrecting the language he has used against other Black female prosecutors, such as Letitia James in New York and Fani Willis in Georgia, both of whom he has called “racist” and attacked in personal terms. \nDonald J.

They assess the targets ahead of them. They trust in the preparation that got them there. \nBefore the members of the U.S. shooting team got a chance to fire their rifles, pistols and shotguns this month in the Paris Games, they had to get them there first.
