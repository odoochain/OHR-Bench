A fourth sabotage attempt was foiled, the authorities said, when railway workers doing maintenance work in Vergigny, southeast of Paris, stumbled upon suspicious individuals who fled before any damage was done. \nAround 4 a.m., the arsonists cut through and burned cables used for signaling and security near three rail divides, the French authorities said. The carefully placed strikes snarled end-ofweek travel plans for more than a million people, including Parisians leaving for vacation and international travelers en route to the opening ceremony of the Games. Parts of the prized rail \n“This operation was prepared, coordinated, critical points were targeted, which shows they knew enough about the network to know where to strike,” Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. \nThe sabotage, set at critical junctures on France’s Atlantic, North and East rail arteries, meant trains were parked or slowed between Paris and major cities that are hosting some Olympic competitions, including Bordeaux, Marseille, Nice and Lille. \nSome of the bright orange bats were framed in shadow boxes, their boldly striped wings spread wide. Others were mounted in miniature coffins with shiny fittings. A few were promoted as Halloween or Christmas gifts. \nNo one was killed or reported injured.

No immediate claim of responsibility was made. \nAn Etsy listing this month for the species Kerivoula picta. \nBigger, more charismatic species like elephants and tigers usually come to mind when the illicit animal trade is mentioned.

Dr. Randhawa and her colleagues followed up on that observation with a more systematic study. From October to December 2022, they regularly searched for listings on eBay, Etsy and Amazon. Many types of bats appeared in the results, but they focused primarily on Kerivoula picta, a species from Asia known as the painted woolly bat or fire bat, because its distinctive orange fur and striped wings \nThriving Black Market Trade Raises Worries for Populations \n# \nContinued on Page A6 \nSprawling Fire Getting Bigger A blaze in California has burned more than 164,000 acres, the state’s largest this year.

Mr. Vance was used to the spotlight, having made his name as the best-selling author of the memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” years before he was elected to the United States Senate in 2022, but his wife had remained largely a private figure. \nIn a speech to an ecstatic crowd of union teachers on Thursday in Houston, Vice President Kamala Harris previewed the education issues that she wants to focus on in her abbreviated campaign for the White House: student loan forgiveness, protecting schools from \n\n# \nWhatever nerves the self-possessed Mrs. Vance might have Continued on Page A13 \n# \ngun violence and resisting Republican attempts to restrict curriculums. \nIt sounded like a story ripped from a narco thriller: One of the biggest drug lords in Mexico was lured onto an airplane, flown across the border and presented to American federal agents by the son of his former partner in crime. As improbable as it may seem, that is exactly what appears to have happened on Thursday evening, when a Beechcraft King Air turboprop landed at a small municipal airport outside El Paso, and off stepped one of the most wanted men in Mexico: Ismael Zambada García, a founder of the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel. \n# \nThis article is by Alan Feuer, Natalie Kitroeff and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega. \n“While you teach students about our nation’s past, these extremists attack the freedom to learn and acknowledge our nation’s true and full history,” she said to applause and cheers. “Including book bans. Book bans in this year of our Lord 2024!” \nBut Ms. Harris’s speech to members of the American Federation of Teachers also ignored several crucial education issues that could put her on shakier political ground — and that Republicans are already seeking to tie her to.

The analysis examined nearly 800,000 shipments of restricted electronic goods into Russia since mid-2021. \nEven as the West sought to cut off access to semiconductors through trade restrictions, Russia established such a robust parallel supply chain that it imported almost the same number of critical chips in the last three months of 2023 that it did in the same period in 2021, according to the analysis of Russian customs data. The reliance on China for many of these chips also deepened, with transactions that were historically settled in U.S. dollars now increasingly executed in renminbi, according to the analysis. \nYet the companies are a crucial link in a chain connecting U.S. research laboratories to Chinese factories, Russian arms makers and the battlefields of Ukraine — and a sign that the U.S. government and tech giants cannot control where their technology goes. \nThe ability of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to flout Western trade restrictions has been one of the failings of the U.S.- led response to the war in Ukraine. Rather than become economically isolated, Russia has emerged from more than two years of conflict emboldened in its attacks against Ukraine. \nThe companies have names like Olax Finance and Rikkon Holding.

The chip companies are not legally required to track where their goods go from there. Russia has then turned to the international distributors — which are in Hong Kong, China, Turkey, India, Serbia and Singapore, according to The Times’s analysis — extend.
