She will be treated at a hospital in Dayton, Ohio, for third-degree burns on her face. \n# \nThis article is by Alan Feuer, Ben Protess, Jonah E. Bromwich and William K. Rashbaum. \nThe judge overseeing Donald J. Trump’s criminal trial in Manhattan rebuked the former president on Monday for mounting “a direct attack on the rule of law,” holding him in contempt of court for a second time and threatening to jail him if he continued to break a gag order that bars him from attacking jurors. \nIn a moment of remarkable courtroom drama, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, addressed Mr. Trump personally from the bench, saying that if there were further violations, he might bypass financial penalties and place the former president behind bars. \nJustice Merchan acknowledged that jailing Mr. Trump was “the last thing” he wanted to do, but explained that it was his responsibility to “protect the dignity of the justice system.” \nThe judge said that he understood “the magnitude of such a decision” and that jailing Mr. Trump would be a last resort. He noted: “You are the former president of the United States, and possibly the next president as well.” \nAs the judge delivered his admonition and imposed a \\$1,000 fine, Mr. Trump stared straight at him, blinking but not reacting, and when the remarks were over, the former president shook his head. It was the second time in two weeks that Mr. Trump had been punished for breaking the gag order, which also bars him from attacking prosecutors, witnesses and others. Among the violations of which Mr. Trump has been accused, Justice Merchan has taken those involving the jury most seriously. \nhe violation for which he was Continued on Page A16 \n# \n# \nBERLIN — Russia said on Monday that it would hold military exercises with troops based near Ukraine to practice for the possible use of battlefield nuclear weapons, a provocative warning aimed at discouraging the West from deepening its support for Ukraine. \nThese weapons, often referred to as “tactical,” are designed for battlefield use and have smaller warheads than the “strategic” nuclear weapons meant to target cities. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that President Vladimir V. Putin had ordered an exercise for missile, aviation and naval personnel to “increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.” \n# \nThe announcement of the exercise was Russia’s most explicit warning in its more than two-year invasion of Ukraine that it could use tactical nuclear weapons there. The Kremlin said it came in response to comments by two European leaders that raised the prospect of more direct Western intervention in the war. \nThe exercise, the Defense Ministry said, will take place “in the near future” and involve forces of the Southern Military District, an area that covers Russian-occupied Ukraine and part of Russia’s border region with Ukraine. \n\nThe order heightens tensions with the West at the start of a week of extensive publicity for Mr. Putin: his inauguration on Tuesday, then the annual Victory Day celebration on Thursday, which commemorates the Soviet victory in World War II. \nIt also coincided with a visit to Europe by President Xi Jinping of China, which has pledged a “no limits” alliance with Russia. China has provided support to Russia’s military industry, U.S. officials say, despite persistent lobbying from the West that it refrain from aiding Russia’s war effort. \nAsked about Mr. Putin’s order on Monday, John F. Kirby, a White House national security spokesContinued on Page A11 \nAMIR HAMJA/THE NEW YORK TIMES\nWhere Dressing Is an Art Zendaya showing off her “Garden of Time”-themed attire at the Met Gala.

The new designation, proposed in a study published Monday, could broaden the scope of efforts to develop treatments, including gene therapy, and affect the design of clinical trials. \n\nIt could also mean that hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone could, if they chose, receive a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s before developing \n# \nany symptoms of cognitive decline, although there currently are no treatments for people at that stage. \nThe new classification would make this type of Alzheimer’s one of the most common genetic disorders in the world, medical experts said. \n\n“This reconceptualization that we’re proposing affects not a small minority of people,” said Dr. Juan Fortea, an author of the study and the director of the Sant Pau Memory Unit in Barcelona, \nContinued on Page A20 \n# \n# \nAmong 100 Evacuated for Urgent Treatment \nFEARS OF INVASION RISE \n# \nThe four children had survived horrors in Gaza. \nBut on Sunday morning, they reached the end of an arduous journey out of the conflict zone and into American hospitals to receive urgent medical care. They flew from Cairo to Kennedy Airport, where they were greeted with much fanfare by a crowd of about 50 people carrying plush toys, flowers and bobbing balloons. \nAmong the children was Fadi Alzant, 6, a gaunt boy with pale skin and strawberry blond hair who appeared dazed as the crowd rushed around his wheelchair. An airport employee grew agitated and shouted at people to disperse and to put away their cameras. \nFadi, who has cystic fibrosis and weighs about 25 pounds, is suffering from severe malnourishment caused by famine, according to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which coordinated the children’s journeys with assistance from the World Health Organization. \nHe will be treated at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens. Paramedics lifted the tiny, wideeyed child out of his wheelchair and onto a gurney that dwarfed him even further. Then, they carried him to an ambulance bound for the hospital. \n“We love you!” said a woman in the crowd, who was dabbing her eyes. \n“Let’s not overwhelm them, guys,” someone else said. “Did they get water?” \nThe Relief Fund, a volunteerbased nonprofit organization that provides free medical care to injured and sick children, said the other children’s journeys would end at hospitals in Ohio, Texas and South Carolina. \nTareq Hailat, who helps oversee the travel efforts for the charity group, said that the children had been chosen based on referrals from hospitals in Gaza or, more commonly, discovered through social media posts about children in need. The group found Fadi, for instance, after his mother made a video pleading for help that went viral. The team has evacuated more than 100 children to Egypt, and 60 were then taken to other countries. Seven of them, including the four who arrived Sunday, have been brought to the United \nSince the war in the Gaza Strip began after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed about 1,200 people, more than 34,000 people have died in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. \nContinued on Page A9 \nHamas Claims to Have Accepted a Proposal for a Cease-Fire \nThis article is by Vivek Shankar, Liam Stack, Adam Rasgon and Michael Levenson. \nThe Israeli military began dropping leaflets in eastern Rafah telling people to move to what it called a humanitarian zone to the north and said it would also notify people by text messages, phone calls and broadcasts in Arabic. A military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the crowded city but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7. \nHours later, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, issued a statement that the group had accepted a cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt, which have acted as intermediaries in peace talks. The details remained unclear, but comments by officials of Hamas and Israel quickly made it apparent that Mr. Haniyeh was not referring to the proposal that Israel recently agreed to, leaving the conflict unresolved. \nIsraeli warplanes pounded targets in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Monday as the military told about 110,000 people sheltering there to evacuate. Many people began to leave, fearing that Israel was moving ahead with its long-planned invasion, despite stiff international pressure. \nOn Sunday, the talks appeared to reach an impasse, with Israel and Hamas still sharply at odds over the duration of any truce, and each side blaming the other for the failure to strike a deal. Hamas wants a permanent cease-fire, \nJohn F. Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, declined to comment on the Hamas response, saying the United States was reviewing it. \nContinued on Page A8 \n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE — GETTY IMAGES Gazans who fled Rafah arrived Monday in Khan Younis. \n# \n# \n# \nPARIS — Jordan Bardella, 28, is the new face of the far right in France.
