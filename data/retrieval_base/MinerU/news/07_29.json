Trump, doling out millions to try to elect the former president and his allies. \nA hulking boulder once positioned just offshore in Narragansett Bay, the runestone bears inscriptions that some believe \n\nBut in less than two weeks, Mr. Vance has found himself on the defensive, and his struggles have dented the sense of invulnerability that only a week ago seemed to be the overriding image of the Trump campaign. \nThe choice of Senator JD Vance as former President Donald J. Trump’s running mate reflected the confidence of a campaign so sure of victory in November that it could look beyond a second Trump term to the legacy of his movement. \nTimothy Mellon is a reclusive heir to a banking fortune. \nBut to his neighbors in a Rhode Island beachfront enclave, he is better known as the prime suspect in the Narragansett Runestone Affair. \nA stream of years-old quotes, videos and audio comments unearthed by Democrats and the news media in recent days has threatened to undermine the Trump campaign’s outreach to women, voters of color and the very blue-collar voters Mr. Vance, \n# \n\n# \n# \nAnd then one day it was gone. A criminal investigation yielded a witness who had heard sounds of heavy machinery at night. Mr. Mellon refused to talk and hired a former state attorney general as his lawyer. Nearly a year later, the matter was resolved quietly: Mr. Mellon agreed to return the stone, and prosecutors agreed not to bring charges. \nThe episode was a rare glimpse into the private life and the public dealings of Mr. Mellon, 81, a reclusive heir and railroad magnate who has recently turned himself into a political force. He has surprised even political insiders with the size of his contributions this year, throwing $\\$75$ million behind Mr. Trump’s attempt to return to the White House and an additional \\$25 million toward Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential run, making him both candidates’ single largest benefactor. All told, he has given \\$227 milon in contributions to fede \nwere left by Viking explorers.

Mr. Vance’s fresh efforts to explain them have provided Democrats more material; the Harris campaign promoted one short clip in which he clarified on his comments on childless cat ladies, saying that he was sarcastic — “I’ve got nothing against cats,” he said. And his first handful of appearances on the stump have drawn unflattering attention.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, facing domestic pressure to mount a fiercer response, met with senior ministers and security officials on Sunday to discuss further steps, after flying back early from a trip to the United States. \nJERUSALEM — Western diplomats were scrambling on Sunday to prevent a surge of fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border, officials said, after a rocket from Lebanon on Saturday killed at least 12 children and teenagers in an Israeli-controlled town. The rocket prompted Israel to retaliate early Sunday with strikes across Lebanon. \nIsrael blamed Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese group that has been attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, for the deadly rocket attack on Saturday on the Druse Arab town of Majdal Shams. Hezbollah has denied it was responsible. \nFrench officials also passed messages back and forth between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Western official who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. France still has some influence in Lebanon owing to its former status as a French protectorate after World War I. \n“We are trying to restrain Hezbollah now from retaliating to whatever the Israelis do next,” Mr. Bou Habib said in a call with The New York Times. It was not immediately possible to confirm that with U.S. officials. \nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement that Hezbollah had organized the attack. “It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control,” the statement said. \nforces to make slow and costly gains. \nThis article is by Patrick Kingsley, Euan Ward and Isabel Kershner. \n# \nContinued on Page A9 \n\n# \nResistance to Newsom’s Order Los Angeles is fighting the California governor’s declaration urging cities to clear homeless camps.
