        "text": "Iwll say that I am well, and have been so,since Ileft here: though much exposed by sea and land.The ostensible reasons fer my going to Burmah were partially, for the purpose of ascertaining the true situation of tha people calied Kerrens,an account of which was forwarded to you by br.Luddington, besides many others coming from the same sourc,viz:the MisslonaryBaptists,have induced me to enquire into their situation, and character. And besides,my sonl is slck of trying the people of Hin dostan,and I felt as though I could ransack the furtherest corner of the earth,tofind a peoplethat would believe our testimony,and obey the gospel.But when I found the people called Kerrens, they were in many respects like all other Asiaties; laboring under the accumulated traditions of several thousandyears,whlch areso strong ly interwoven with their very existence,that it seems a thing almost impossble to make any inroads upon them, or raise their narrow minds,to the idea that there is a God besides theirs, who is in possesslon of knowledge and power. They suppose that we know nothing of the God whom we serve,only by fabulous legends,slmllar to theirown. \nThe Burmas Imust say,as a people are far in advance of the Bengalles; they don't maniest that crouching crawling, servlle spirit,which the Hindoos possess.Be sldes,they are much fairer n complexion than the large majority of Hindoos; and in their features,they are anothermould altogether.There is a slight resemblance to be traced in their out-lines,between them and the Malays but they more strongly resemble the inhabitants of Siams Cochin-China, and the Celestial Empire. These three are more or less scattered all through the Burman Empire and can only be told from them by their dress, and some times by theraode of worship,butnot alwaysforIhave seen them and the Burmas both worshiping at the same time and place. From the great simllarity in their language,and many of their traditfons,I strongly inoline to the opinlon that they have sprung from the same Tartar origin. \nIn statue, the Burmahs are notmore than five feet eight or nine inches, the tallest of them,and have very peculiar habits prevaling amonght them,one of which is they wll not take animal life,or kill anything for thelr own use at all; they do however, catch and eat fsh; this is the only animal food which they make use of,except the animal should die,when they would have no scrupies ineating it,it matters not what the disease might have ben; this as a matter of course,makes themost part f their diet vegetable,in which may be includeded the leaves of trees,and jungle fruit; the latter Iam told is very abundant during its season. They also make a free useofnarcoties, such asoplum; tobacco,and betel-nut they are the most inveterate smokers I have ever seen children, before they are weaned from the breast,often commence the use of the cigar. \nThe Burmahs cultivate the earth but toa limited extent. Their prineipal production isriee;but I am told n the upper parts of the country,about Ava, that some wheat is raised,of an inferior quality but it cannot be to any greatextent.They live in poor miserable hovels, made of bamboo, and thatched with grass.They are set upon postsa few feet above the ground, andare often setover a stinking pond of water,where all the ilth from the house can drop through the floor,which is left open for that purpose, and the foul efluvia which arises from the stinking cesspools is almost beyond endurance to a half civilized nose.Thelr wearing apparel, and everything which they use,is purely domestic, and there Is no such thing as caste among them. You can find a loom in al most every house,and the cloth which they manufacture much resembles French Gmghams,or Scotch Plaid,and is very strong and erviceable.There are also large qnan titles of sikmanufactured,but I dld not see any of them atwork; it is generally of a coarse quality, but very serviceable,and strong.For common apparel themen wear \nTraditions-dress-manners and customs of the people-appearance of the country-movements ofelders,gc. \nThe women are very singular in their costume; thelr dress consists of a single piece of cloth,which is nearly square,and a litle more than reaches round them,with the open part in front； they draw the upper edge tightly around them,and the lower edge is hanging alittle below the kneesafteritis sueiently tight,theoutidecorner is tuckedunder this asanatural consequence,leaves the garment nearly all open before,and every time the wind blows,their whole person is exposed.They do not seem tomindanything about itand cannot be prevailed upon to change their mode of dress. The women are much superior to the men,and as a general thing, are much fairer in complexion, and of a fine carriage, and very kind,clvi, and courteous There is none of that shy, sneaking,fcted tmdty,hatcharacterlzeswn of Bengal; they do all of the work in the house,and out ofdoors aswecallitbutitisallout of doors to them, for they have no dors to their houses they also do all ofthe buying and selling.The men are a very lazy,idle set.The Burmahs believe in and practiee a pluralty of wivesextensively,andImust say,that there is theleast immorality, and leentlous hablts, practied amongst tem of any people that I have ever seen,except the saints.Adultery is punished bythe death of theman,tobe executed by the husband or frlend of the woman; and they without any exceptlons far excel anynation In th sngle plece of cloth around the loins,and a pugrah (cloth） around the head; they wear their halr long,and never shave; they pluck out their eye brows. This is their every-day appearance. \n\nPresident J.M.Grant-Dear Brother-Seven months ive nowelapsed since my last communication to our ach beloved brother and Presldent Willard Richards, ceased; and as Iiearn that you have succeeded him in ice, I shall continue my correspondence with yon, and ice more enter the regions of description,relative to atters In the east.I desired to inform you of the pro ress of affairs with us some months ago; but the unsetied state of our prospects was such that I couid not do with any certainty.I have now just arrived from Burnah,where I have been for the iast two months.Not eing able to learn satisfactorlly,the situation of matters here,I rather hurrledly came to the conclusion to go and eeformyself. \n# \nHINDOSTAN. \nCALcUTTA,Nov 5th,1854. \neast,for morality, and irtue; and such a thing as a pubic prostitute is not known amongst them; they are only to be found upon the track of Her Majestys Army.With the march of civilization,and the enlightened etiquette of the Anglo-saxon race,follows crime in all its horrid forms licentlousness and treachery are in the front rank; and the condition of the natives in this respect,retrogades with the advanceof British rule. \nTradition says concerning the dress of the women,that about 150 years ago the nation were sosunken in vlce and wickedness. that they were about to become extinctin consequence ot anational evin, which prevailed to an alarming degree,which was the crime of Sodomy The then relgning king and queen enforced upon the females olthe nation by decree the kind of dress which Ihave already described,the queen herself setting the pattern first then enjoined upon all others, with the hope or reclaiming the men by the exposure or their persons which it appears has had a salutary effect.The Kerrens are somewhat different from the Burmahs in personal appearance; they are more of a stalwart,hard-fisted race, and have long been oppressed by the Burmahs; many of them are much lighter complexioned than the Burmahs,the women in particular; they also dress different; they have not such uncomely fashlons as the Burmahs. Their language is also diferent, and I think them a very good people for Asiatics. But their traditions, like all the rest,are the predominent and ruling features of the people.From what Iheard I felt very anxlous to establish the gospel amongst them;my mind was full of hope,and buoyant with anti clpatlons, that the Lord had a people amongt them.Such were my feelingsof them,from the best information that Icouldget. \nAtKangoon I saw arewwnoDeiongeu totnemission ary Station in that place; but this was not satisfactory I wished to see them in their native villages, where tlhey were untaught, and uncontaminated by the pernicious infuences of misslonary prlestcraft wlich hasmoney for its end,and begiuning,and is Incompetant to correct its own errors,much less to enlighten the benighted minds of the so called heathen, Most of the Kerrens speak the Burmeselanguage. Brother Savage also speaks that language well. We accordingly began to make preparatlons for atrip amongst them.Ifirst tried to obtain some conveyancebyland,but Isoonlearned thatconsequenceof the incessant rains which prevall here six months in the year,that the road was not passable for anything except an amphiblous animal. I am told that the country is filled with deep nullacks (ravines) and broad tracts of low land,whlch were most likely to be covered with water at this season.We then came to the conelusion to hire a boat,which we dld,forfour English shilings per day after providing ourselves with the needrul for the trips we set off.The first day found us far beyond the reach of any except natives,who looked like the inhabitants of Neptune, that had just emerged from the watery element, a strange sight to American eyesl a whole village setting upon posts,from eight to ten feet above the surface of the water,with acountless number of hog,dogsand fowls, living upon the same platform. It brought to my mind In full force, the old adage, that one half of the world does not know how the other half livesThe only means of conveyance from one house to another is by boats which every family is in possesson of. The entire face of the country as far as the eye can reach ls submerged in water, ranging from two to five feet in depth.

There are often two and thre familles in a house; they area veryhospitable and kind peoplebuthav n ltr ary attainments. \nAsto theirrelglous vlews,Ididnot fnd them as represented by the misslonaries. They do not worship the Great Spirit, as it has been stated very many of them areBuddhists,”and those that are not do not worship anything. Br.Savage told them who we were,and the nature of our message,but they could not understand it at al; they have no correct idea of God, and the whole affairwasanew trainof thought,and schaburst ofnw ideas upon their contracted minds that they had not the slightest conception of what we were talking about. They are governed by tradition, and Instinet. All one generation knows of another is by tradlitlon, and it is more frmly riveted upon the minds of this people than of those in any other country.We visited them from vllage to village, for some days, and what we saw in the frst we saw in the last; they were all allke. We visited in onevllage,some who had beenconverted to christian ity by the Ameriean Baptists.We asked them-if they beleved God,and nhisonJesusGhrist,andintheHo ly Ghost； to which they answered yes.The fruits of thein professlon were not to be seen; Icould not discern any change in them more than in those that made no professlon;and Icould not see that their condition was in the slghtestmanner bettered.Ititrue, they acknowledged that they believed in Godbut that is all there was of it. Itis far worse than itis with theUtah Indians ask them if theybeleve in God,and they wllsay yes,every tme, and have some very good traditions. \nLest I should be tedlous n my detalls,I wll say ina word,that to me there appears no chance for the.old stock ever being brought to a knowledge of thetruth.To commence with the young ones is the only hope,and that is like beginning with the raw material,or aeting upon the native element, which perhaps may be brought into subjection in another generation, provided they are emigrated,which they are averse to.I do not think it can be done effectually in this country,at least not untilthe reign of righteousness is fully entered in,then perhaps will be thelr day of grace. \nI found in Rangoon a small branch of the Church In a fourishing condition,under the guidance of elders wilis and MeCune,which now numbers about 22.I stopped a short timo with them, during which time I dellvered two courses of lectures nightiy; there were four added to the Church during my stay.Br.Levi Savagejr.will remain at this place,and labor with the Burmahs, and if posslble obtain a footing amongst them; he has already spent about one year amongst them; but he has not been able to make any converts yet.I frankly confess that I have no faith in their obeying the gospel,until a different spirit prevalls from the one which theyare in possesslon of at present.Br.Willis embarked for the valley,via Panang and Sinagpoore,on the 9th of Sept.He arrived’safely at Singapoore on the Sth of Oct,and found bro.Lnddington who had returned from Siam some three weeks previous, and was then lecturing in Singapoore, but expected to leave in a day or two, for Mallacca. There being no opportunity of shipping for America for some months to come br.Willis concluded to ship for England,which he di about the15th of Oet.,on the Gazelle,Capt Leslle,bound forLiverpool, \n\nIn Calcutta matters remaln much as they were six months ago; br.Woolley has been here for some months past.Br.Fotheringham is near Cuttack,and br.Meik is at Cuttack; he says,there is some hopes of adding a few in thatplace.The prospects for our emigratlon this cold weather are not very fattering at present; I however shall do my best to accomplish something in that way; I trust inthe Lord that I may be able to gather a few.Brother Woolley had embarked for the United States; he sailed on the first of Nov.,on board the John Gilpin bound for Boston.Iam now alone in this place,and expect to be for some timeyetto come. \nBrothers Woolley and Fotheringham have faithfully warned the inhabitants of the north western provinces of India,and in every place the people have manifested the most perfect indifference,and there hasnot been for some time past enough to occupy the attention of one elder. Bro.Robert Owens salled for the valley via Australla,in July last.Br.Ballantyne sailed for England the last of the same month.Br. Skelton remains at Madras, still trying to do them some good; no accessions to our numbers.Br.Hugh Finley at Belgium, has baptized a few during the summer,amidst much opposition.The military authorities of India, will have much to answer for; they have opposed our elders in every station where they have attempted to preach the gospel, and in some instances,when we had found those that were favorably inclined towards us,as soon as the officers heard of ft, they would commence a regular system of oppression against them,untill they would break their spirit,and make them cower before them,for thelr prosperity depends upon the approval of their superior. \nBr.Leonard and Musser are in the Scinde country where they have been since last March; they have baptized two; prospects dull.I cannot tell when I shall be able to leave here.Remember me kindly to Prests.Young and Kimball, and may they live long to bless the people of God,and bulld up Zlon,is my prayer in the name of Jesus; and may His cholcest blessings rest upon you, in connection with them.I wish tobe remembered to all who\\*express a wish or a thought after me,especlally to br. Carrington, and those that have sent me the Deseret News. \nWith much love to yourself and famlly, I remain you affectionate bro.in the gospel, \nDEAR BR.J.M.GRANT: \n41 Charlotte St.,Glasgow,Scotland, November28.1854. \nI take pleasure at this time in giving you a short ac oountof my present feeling in the work of the Lord,and what my desires are.I can say ofa truth thatI never felt better than I do at present,my faith is strong In theLord,and I know,by the way I am blessed from time to time,that God is with me by his Holy Spirit,and glves me strength and joy all the day long. \nIoften wish,in my ministering to the people,thatI had more ability,but when I conslder and see how God ac knowledges me Iam forced to admit that It is the humbleman of God who will stand, and whom the Lord de lightethtohonor. \nIhave felt well in my labors in Scotland.The saints uphold me by their faith,prayers,and confldence, and I have the greatest confidence in the brethren who are over me.Elders Franklin D.Richards and Daniel Spencer are faithful servants of God; they study the interests of the church,and use thelr influence continually for that object.Ilove,esteem,and respect them,and know that the Lord delights to blessthem. \nIam appointed to the pastoral charge of the Liverpool, Manchester,and Praston Conferences,and enter upon its duties,at the New Year.I feel the weight of the responslbility which devolves upon me in this sphere,and am satisfed that without the aid of the Spirit of the Great Jehovah Iwould not be qualiffed for this position.I feel tolean upon the Lord ajl the day long,and to cry unto bim foraid continually thatmy labors may be blessed and crowned with success, that having finished my misslonI may creditably return home and in the assemblies of Zion receive the rewardingmandate of Gods servants,well done br.George, the Lord is pleased with your labors.It is for this I live,and this is what I wish to accomplish,to dogood to the honest sons of men,to show them the road to exaltation in thekingdom of God,and be exalted wlth thiem. \nPlease remember me to Presidents Brigham Young and HeberC.Kimball.Ioft remember them, and pray that God may shield and preserve them continually.Remember meto all inquiring friends in Zion; tell them I am well and feel well. May God bless you br. Jededlah, and qnalify you continually for the holy responsibllity that is placed upon you in connection with the Flrst Presideney, and for every other duty in life,is the constant prayer of your affectionate brother in the bonds of the covenant. GEORGED.GRANT. \nI frequently have letters from Wm.H.Kimball,Joseph A.Young, Jameg Ferguson, and other Elders from Deseret; they all feel as I do,and are doing a good work.We are alllearning lessons whieh will beprofitable to us in futureday. \n[From the Millennial Star.] AUSTRALIA.   \nRenewed Interest in the Work-Opposition-Anticipated Emigration of Saints. 103,PARAMATTA STREET,Sydney, Sept.18,1854.   \nF.D.RICHARDS: Dear BrotherI embrace the opportunity offered me to   \ncongratulate you upon your safe arrival among the Britis \nSaints, and I sincerely pray that the Lord may eminently bless you, In your two-fold capaeity of President of the British Mission,and editor of the Star. \nIt gives me pleasufe to inform you,that the work of the Lord fn these colonies is progressing.We are not baptizing our hundreds or fifties at one time,the work la moving along slowly but surely,more so in the tnterior than in this city.The principles are winning thelr widening way lnto every class of society.In fact,“Mormonism has made quite an excitement among the people recently,the clergy have awakened in the opposition with renewed zeal and energy,and no course is too mean or despicable for them to pursue, so that they can but pre vall upon the people not to listen to the elders,nor to read our books.The usual ebullitions of calunny and slander,with thcir concomitants of faisehood,blasphemy, ignorance,&e., are poured forth in a manner allke discreditable to intelligence and honor.At this we are not astonished,for what other weapons could they bring forth against truth and righteousness. \nAll this does not dlscourage us in the least,for we know whose we are,and that the work we are engaged in is the work of the Great God.And we feel gratefnl to ur Father In heaven,who has In our weakness made us strong, glving us light,knowledge,and power In the thingsof his kingdom,so that we have been enabied at all times to rebuke the scorner, silence the gainsayer, and instruct and counsel the Saints. \nIt is true,the people of these lands are apecullar people, being generally dead to the interests of religion, caring but little what the true princlples of the Gospel are; it may,Indeed,be said of them,that their falth is a mere tradition, their worship an empty form, the impression being transitory,ending with the service,when thty again devote themselves to gold and pleasure. But withal, there are some as good and honest people in thes lands,as can be found on the earth. These must be hunted and fished out and gathered.To accomplish this weare encouraged to labor,but the apathy of the people and thelr scattered condition, together with the great opposition manifested by the priests, tend muoh to embarras our movemente,and to retard the progress of the work. \nStill the Lord has blessed us and our labors,aud we feel assured that he will continue to do so. The desire to leave the confines or Babylon pervades the mass of the Saints here,and they are striving with all thelr power to gather, so that it is expected that another company will leave here about April or May next. May God the eternal Father bless you, and prosper hs work in your hands,is the earnest desire of \nYour brother in the Gospel, \nAUGUSTUS FARNHAM. \n[New York Herald.] \n# \nNEW YoRK,Dec.20,18 \nGENTLEMEN-Your note of the -th inst., in which you request information concerning the mesquite tree and Its gum,was duly received,and I with pleasure avall mysell of the first leisura moment to reply o your interrogatories. \nThe tree commonly known in this country as the meequite,was first discovered by Dr.Edwin James,formerly assistant surgeon in the United States army, while attached to Col.Longs exploring expeditlon to the Rocky Mountains,thirty-slx years ago. It is a yariety of the acacia,which Is found se abuudantly in Indla,Africaan！ other parts of the East, and possesses many properties in common with other specles of that group of plants. \nWhat the exact geographlcal range of this tree Is,we are as yet unable (with a great portlon of our territory unesplored) to defne; my own observations however, warrant me in asserting confidently that it is only fmligenous to the great plains of the West and South,extendIng far beyond the llmits of most other varleties of trees. and it would seem from its locality to have been planted by an All-wise Provldence with special reference tothe wants of the occupants of a sectlon of country sulted to the growth otnoother tree. \nBetween the twenty-sixth and thirty-sixth parallels of north latitude,within the nety-seventh and one hundred and third meridfans of longitule,It Is found everywhere,orten constitutingvast tracts ofwoodland,and is, indeed,aimost the only sylva of the sectlon.It is alo found In very many places between the Rocky Mountain range and the Pacifie ocean;but it appears to flourish better and to obtain greater dimenstons in the vlcinity of the Gila river than in any other locality Ihave heard of west of the Rio del Norte. \nIn going north from the parallel or thirty-three degrees, (in the directionI have traveled) the trees gradually b come smaller and smaller,untll at last they are mere bushes,and fnally,on arriving near the latitude or thirtysix degrees,they entirely lisappear. \nThe vast geographieal ranga of the mesquite tree, covering as it does an area of more than 500,o00 squara miles, and its many useful properties,some or which wll be enumerated in the sequel, renders it avallable,andI have no doubt it is destined to become highly important to the future occupants ofa large section of our new territory. \nIt is a tree of short, serubby growth,the stock averag Ing from four to fifteen inches in diameter,and seldo attaining a height,including lts top,of more than twenty feet.The Hmbs are short, crooked and thickly studdad withlong sharp thorns; the leaves pinnated, and the leal lets are long and eliptical; the bark a dark gray,re sembling that of the peach tree; the wood coarse grained,verybrlttle,and theheart,which constitutes neary the entire tree,somewhat lke the darker varleties ofm hogany. \nIt bursreadily,even when green,with aright,her ful flame,leaving a residue of coals almost as perfect in form as the original wood,making a very hot fre,and i indeed,the best fuel Ihave ever senhikoryotex ted. \nIt possesses durabilty inaneminent degreeand s consequence, much used for building and fenciug,in Southern Texas and Mexico.As an evidence of its last ingqualitiesI have seen pieces of thewood,ina perect state of preservation,embedded In the stones of an old ruin upon the Nneces river, in Texas, whlch must have been exposed tothe weatherfor scores ofyear,asmany of the stones had become dlsintegrated, and crunbled a way with age,while the wood resmained sound. \nThemesquite isoften found uponvery elevated and arid"
