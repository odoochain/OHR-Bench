He described our fear of the power of the wholly as in part dependent on a limitation of our own wisdom as to the extent of that power, and described this uncertainty as the origin of that fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wisdom. Willifound evidence of that power in the unscaled mountains of this world and described it as the type of power which convinced us we were no longer in charge of our destiny. \nNow I must confess that I never ventured into the high mountains with Willi.I always said to my self that it was due to bad knees but the whole truth is that even the small bit of climbing I did convinced me that there had to be other ways to find the presence of God that were not quite as terrifying. Little did I know that my love of sailing would lead to similar experiences. \nMy wife and I bought a sailboat before we bought a house. It has always been a great source of joy and adventure for me. Over the course of the years friends would ask if I ever had sailed to Hawai. I would reply no, but that I intended to one day. Finally it became apparent that I would go only if I established a scenario I could not back out of and so Iregistered for the 1976 Victoria to Maui race, the first of four I would subsequently participate in. Only one of our crew had previous Ocean experience and as the skipper, I had absolutely none. I was not quite certain what I would find and suspected that Columbus's crew were correct that the world was indeed flat with a great waterfall at the end over which all intrepid mariners would fall. I recallthinking that the race would be a wonderful opportunity to experience that same type of experience that Willi had in his adventures in the sky. Nothing of the miraculous happened except that we survived a number of strong storms which eliminated a number of the competing boats. I quickly realized that there are no large boats on the Ocean and that the power of God's sea was of the nature of that dangerous power of which we Can never be certain that Willireferred to.An unusual thing did happen,however,of an entirely different nature from what I expected. One morning just as dawn broke on the ocean I was at the helm of the boat steering down towering seaswith the spinnaker set,catapultingus down thatface of onewave after another.I found myself singing at the topofmy lungs songs from earlier days in Sunday School that I thought I had entirely forgotten.They were IThis ismyFathers Worldl and IThere is a Wideness to Godâ€™s Mercy like the Wideness of the Sea. There is not time this morning to go over allthe words to those magnificent hymns but a few lines will sufficehe last verse ofThis ismyFather'sworldafter recognizing hishandwork inall about usin the first hreeaffirms:Ihis ismy father'sworld,letmeneer forget.hat though thewrong seems oft so strong,God is theRuleryet.ThisismyFather'sworldthe battle isnot done;Jesuswho died shall be satisfied,and earth and heaven beone"

It left me with the strong impressjon that at no   \npoint in the life of a human being are we wise enough to say a person is beyond redemption   \nand that the only alternative, in an effort to protect society, is the imposition of the death   \npenalty. I viewed the imposition of a life sentence with no possibility of parolelas a better $T_{3}h/\\min$   \nalternative.

Following the ruling of the United States Supreme Court in the early 1980's which made imposition of the death penalty again possible in state courts, our state Supreme Court heard approximately twenty four cases where the death penalty was imposed. I dissented to each of those cases on law related grounds and was upheld on review by our federal courts in all but one of those cases, After viewing the futility of our procedures for imposing the death sentence I began to question whether I could even remain a part of a system which I was convinced was fatally flawed. Even though my dissents were successful, I had to face the issue of whether my participation in the system gave it a credibility it did not deserve. After twenty four years on bur Supreme Court I resigned from that position in 1995 as I believed our system to be fatally flawed. Time and time again, before and after my resignation,the United States has proven that no human is wise enough to say when another is without redemptive possibilities and thatthe death penaltyis not the answer to our crime problem, gen the possibility of an erroneous verdict,"

The courts in South Africa, were in many instances, a bulwark against the worst practices of apartheid. As happens to many of my plans, this did not work out. The time we were in South Africa was the exact time the judges took their vacations and when judges take vacations they are really gone. As we left on our flight to Johannesburg from Capetown, the only seat on the airplane that was open was next to me. Just before takeoff, a talldistinguished black man came in and occupied the seat. As we became acquainted I found his name was Fikil Bamand that he was the Chief Judge of the Land Redistribution Court, a vital part in the rehabilitation taking place.

On Robben island the weather was almost always misty and windswept.

When Mandella finished reciting alnglist of comlaints against the man in the presenceof hisSenioroffic, the man replied by saying Il just want to wish you people good luck.I Mandela recounts that he thought about this moment for a long time afterward.

He told of the daily beatings, of forced labor and inadequate food, of the contempt and hostility of the guards and administration for much of his stay.When I asked him about his faith,he recounted that although he was a Christian as a boy, he was not now actively practicing any faith but every evening, while on Robbin Island would sing to himself the Christian hymns of his childhood. When I asked him about his single most vivid experience in his imprisonment he reflected for a while.He finally said that those who had served for a substantial time on the Island left with no bitterness due to the example of Mandela, but that those who had only stayed a short time and could not e shaed by time y Mandelas spit letwith was great iternes.
