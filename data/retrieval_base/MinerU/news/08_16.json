Shear, Katie Rogers and Adam Entous. \nWASHINGTON — In the end, he was alone. \nConfined to a spare bedroom in his vacation home and fighting off bouts of coughing from Covid, President Biden was exhausted when he turned in for the night on Saturday, July 20. Whether he slept soundly or fitfully or not at all, people close to him said he took the long hours by himself to mull over the historic decision he was about to make. \nHe had just been through a brutal two days in Rehoboth Beach, Del., as he huddled with his wife, Jill Biden, and his closest aides, who rotated from a screened-in porch to a sitting area off the dining room. \nSteve Ricchetti, the president’s eyes and ears on Capitol Hill, and Mike Donilon, his chief strategist, had shared internal polling with the president that Saturday that mirrored what Americans had been seeing for weeks: Mr. Biden was falling behind, nationally and in key battleground states. \nThere was still a path to victory, they advised him, but the fight would be ugly. The president would be pitted against his donors, half of his party in Congress and Democratic voters who had concluded that he was too old to win. \nFor more than three weeks, Mr. Biden had insisted he would stay in the race. Only the “Lord Almighty,” he said, could get him to drop out. But by that Saturday evening, something had shifted. \n\nIt was not just about the polls, people close to Mr. Biden say. Despite everything, Mr. Biden believed he could still claim the Democratic nomination and beat former President Donald J. Trump. Aides say that he still believes that. \nWhat began to change the president’s mind, people familiar with his thinking say, was the realization that if he stayed in the race, he was in for a lonely battle that would rip apart the Democratic Party, the cause he had served nearly his entire life. Would a man who views himself as the ultimate consensus builder in Washington want to wage an intraparty war that would run counter to the fabric of who he is? \nThat day, Mr. Biden asked a key question. \n“If we were going to do it,” Mr. Biden asked his two advisers, “what would we say?” \nA statement was drafted, known only to four other people: the first lady and her closest aide, Anthony Bernal; the president’s son Hunter; and Annie Tomasini, the gatekeeper at the White House and the president’s deputy chief of staff. \nBut first, he wanted a few hours to think. \n$\\mathrm{At}9\\mathrm{p.m}$ . that evening, the president excused himself. It was time to call it a night. To many outsiders, it seemed alContinued on Page A13 \n\nERIC LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday in Largo, Md., their first rally together since he dropped out. \nMore than 200 people on Thitu Island, part of a contested section of the South China Sea, find themselves on the frontier of a possible conflict with China.

There they are: dozens of Chinese ships surrounding a speck of land that a few hundred Filipinos call home. \nFor now though, life is mostly peaceful and slow on the island. Small wooden fishing boats line a white sand beach on the eastern shore. Rough houses pieced together from plywood, scrap lumber and tarps are the main form of shelter. On a recent evening, a few people gathered near the beach to debone fish, while others waded into tide pools with fishing spears. But the calm belies the fact \n# \nthat Thitu is contested land. Nearby, China has stationed a flotilla of coast guard ships and maritime militia vessels. On a neighboring reef, it has constructed a military base whose lights shimmer at night like a city. The intensifying Chinese presence has startled the Philippines, which has occupied Thitu for nearly half a century. So it is upgrading its crumbling military facilities that lie on the island’s southern end. \nAnd it is encouraging more Filipinos to move in, betting more residents will strengthen its claim to Thitu, which it calls Pag-asa, or hope, and reduce hostilities with China. \n\nThese civilians are the only ones in the Spratly Islands — a chain of 100 or so atolls, reefs and cays in the South China Sea that may have significant oil reserves and is claimed by six countries. And they find themselves in the middle of a tense geopolitical dispute. \nMarjorie Ganizo and her hus band, Junie Antonio Ganizo, moved here with their eight children in November despite what they saw as the risk of a Chinese invasion. \n“In the end, we had to ask ourselves: hunger or fear?” Ms. Ganizo, 36, said. “No matter where you are, if it’s your time to die, it’s your time to die.” \nTensions have flared between Continued on Page A6 \n# \nU.S. ASSESSING IMPACT \nMorale Surges for Kyiv’s Military as Moscow Redirects Forces \n# \nWASHINGTON — Ukraine’s incursion into a sliver of Russia is likely to make it harder for Moscow to mount a major renewed offensive in Ukraine’s east and is the kind of surprise operation that could eventually impose real costs on the Kremlin, according to U.S. officials. \nThe Ukrainian strike, and its continued success, could ultimately have strategic significance, though U.S. officials caution that they will need to see how it plays out to draw firmer conclusions. It could also help rebuild sagging morale among Ukraine’s troops and war-weary population, the officials said. \nThe incursion, into the Kursk region of Russia, stands in stark contrast to Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive in southern Ukraine last summer. This offensive was developed in secret, devised to divert Russian troops away from the front lines in Ukraine and seize territory to use as a bargaining chip. \nUkraine’s monthslong buildup to the counteroffensive played out in the open. The Ukrainians had sought to retake territory but stumbled when they failed to punch through dug-in Russian defenses, which Moscow reinforced as Ukraine trained for the drive. Ukraine also split its forces during that offensive, against American advice, rather than focusing them as they have this month. \nBut the incursion into Russia shows how Ukraine’s army has improved its mechanized warfare skills, techniques that it failed to master a year ago. \nlooking for ways to rebound. The operation itself will not drive Russia to the bargaining table, according to U.S. officials. Russia’s president, Vladimir V.

But they will lead to direct out-of-pocket savings for only a subset of the millions of older Americans who take the drugs subject to negotiations. \nWASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled the results of landmark drug price negotiations between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies, allowing President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to cast themselves as confronting the drug industry on behalf of older Americans at a critical moment in the presidential campaign. \nOther provisions of the law that created the drug negotiation program, such as capping patients’ expenses for insulin and their \n# \nyearly out-of-pocket drug costs, will do more to save older Americans money at the pharmacy counter. \n“This is a fight all of us have been fighting for a long time: taking on Big Pharma,” Mr. Biden said at an event in Maryland celebrating the announcement, where he and Ms. Harris had their firs Continued on Page A17 \nThe 10 drugs subject to negotiations include widely used blood thinners and arthritis medications.

After a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., he went on the offensive. \nMr. Walz wrote an opinion piece asserting that he had “repeatedly voted in favor” of tougher background checks, federal gun violence research and firearm bans for people on no-fly lists. He had “voted for universal background checks more than anybody in this race,” he told an interviewer. And he posted a video in which he said he had voted “dozens of times” in Congress for stronger gun laws. \nGun advocates, however, had never questioned his loyalty as a legislator.

Some protesters and politicians who had harried her for months celebrated and claimed victory. Other students and faculty members contemplating her departure were saddened. But there was also cautious optimism that the new interim president, Katrina Armstrong, could better manage a chaotic campus situation that in many ways had become ungovernable for Dr. Shafik. \nAs a newcomer to Columbia, Dr. Shafik had limited experience to help her navigate tensions among different factions on campus and manage a pro-Palestinian movement undeterred by suspensions, arrests and locked campus gates. \nAMANDA ANDRADE-RHOADES FOR NYT Nemat Shafik resigned her post as Columbia’s president. \n\nShe was criticized by both those who thought she did too much to crack down on protesters and those who thought she did not do enough. \nBut Dr. Shafik’s departure still eft some students and faculty members with a sense of sadness that the university had become so Continued on Page A19 \n\n# \nErasing Sign of Racist Pa Rooms in older apartment buildings for maids, a relic of Brazil’s history of slavery, are vanishing.
