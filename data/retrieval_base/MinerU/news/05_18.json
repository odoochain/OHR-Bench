Andrew M. Cuomo at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, as theaters were nervously preparing to reopen after being shut for a year and a half. It was later tripled to \\$300 million by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is considering whether to seek an extension when it expires next year. \nSome state lawmakers and fiscal watchdogs say the theater initiative, called the New York City Musical and Theatrical ProducContinued on Page A22 \n\n# \nAt least four people were killed when a powerful storm ripped through Texas. There was widespread damage in the area around Houston, including blown-out windows in storefronts and downtown high-rises, toppled trees, and downed power lines.

Born in England, the couple moved to Denver years ago and raised their children there. Mrs. James had a profound religious conversion experience early in parenthood, and their large nondenominational church quickly became the focal point of their lives. They used to say that if the doors were open, they were there. \n# \nWhen the couple’s older child was 19, living at home as a college student, Mrs. James got a call from the pharmacy informing her that her child’s prescription for estradiol, or estrogen, was ready. In a panic, she searched the teenager’s room, confronting her that evening. \nabsolutely everything.” \nIt went badly. They initially refused to use their daughter’s chosen name, Lilia, and Mrs. James could barely be in the same room with her when she was wearing a skirt. Then a pastor at the church encouraged them to kick their daughter out of their home. “This must be biblical advice,” she recalled thinking. “This must be what we’re supposed to do.” \n\nMany progressive and Mainline Christian congregations have moved to affirm transgender and nonbinary members. But for many conservative Christians, the rise of transgender identities in both visibility and in sheer numbers, particularly among young people, has been a profoundly destabilizing shift. Almost 90 percent of white evangelicals believe gender is determined by sex at birth, according to the Pew Research Center, compared with Continued on Page A14 \n\n# \n# \nDebates can get, well, ugly in Congress, but rarely do they descend to the level of physical taunts. Yet that is exactly what happened on Thursday during a meeting of the \nCRITIC’S House Oversight NOTEBOOK Committee. During a \ndiscussion about whether Attorney General Merrick B. Garland should be held in contempt of Congress, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republica from Georgia, told Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat from Texas, “I think your \nfake eyelashes are messing up what you’re reading.” \n“How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person,” she said. Further name-calling ensued, culminating in Ms. Crockett’s covertly returning the insult by asking the chair, James R.

The union has said it wants to organize every automobile factory in the United States, expanding its membership to include the employees of companies like Toyota and Tesla. \nBut the loss at the Mercedes plants will almost surely slow down the union’s campaign and probably force it to do more spadework to secure the support of workers before seeking to hold elections at other auto plants. Union leaders will want to spend time figuring out how best to counter the messages and tactics of local lawmakers and company executives. \nThe defeat came after Kay Ivey, Alabama’s governor, and other Republican leaders argued that a pro-union vote would choke off the investment that has transformed the state into a major auto producer. The union’s setback dims the chances that it will be able to quickly organize workers at Hyundai and Honda, which also have large factories in Alabama. \n“This loss stings,” Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at the storefront headquarters of the union’s local branch down the road from the Mercedes factories in Vance and Woodstock, Ala. \nBut “most of us lost elections in Continued on Page A19 \n# \n# \nEmma Lembke did not know what an algorithm was when she started using social media. \n# \n# \nCABO DE LA VELA, Colombia — They came from all over the world to this remote stretch of Colombia’s Caribbean coast. Two hailed from India. Two traveled from Switzerland. One from the Netherlands. Another from Seattle. They all wanted to be taught by Beto Gomez, a professional kite surfer, in the spot where he first learned the sport. \nLa Guajira Peninsula is ideal for kite surfing. In Cabo de la Vela, Mr. Gomez’s hometown, with nearly 1,000 residents and desert terrain, the windy season lasts nine months and the waves are flat. \nSo for five days this year, amateur kite surfers — drawn by Mr. Gomez’s social media and competitions broadcast online — trav\nIn Remote Colombia, a Transformation \neled here for his classes. “In India, we were really cheering for him,” said Shyam Rao, 33, who arrived with his wife. \nKite surfing, using a kite to propel a rider across the water and through the air, is not native to this part of the world or to the Wayuu, Colombia’s largest Indigenous group, which governs the area. It was brought to Cabo de la Vela nearly two decades ago by visiting foreigners, or arijuna, a term in the Wayuu Indigenous language that includes Colombians who aren’t Wayuu. \nNot everyone in the community, \nContinued on Page A5 \n\nBeto Gomez on Colombia’s Caribbean coast.

She quickly followed all kinds of accounts — from Kim Kardashian to Olive Garden, she said — and was soon spending five to six hours a day on the app. Then one day she searched for “ab workouts,” and her feed shifted. She started seeing 200-calorie recipes, pro-anorexia posts and exercise routines that “no 12-year-old should be doing in their bedroom,” she said. \nMs. Lembke, now 21, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in February 2023 about how social media led her to disordered eating, and what she and other advocates see as a dire need for stronger regulation to protect social media’s youngest users. \nSocial media platforms have promised to take more action. On Friday, TikTok enacted what some experts called one of the most well-defined policies by a social media company yet on weight and dieting posts.
