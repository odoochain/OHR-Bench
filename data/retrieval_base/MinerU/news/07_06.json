Trump. They are desperate for the party to find a Plan B. \n“I just love Biden, but he’s frail,” Ms. Winograd said. “Pass the baton.” \nPHOENIX — Jeanne Winograd, 72, a Democrat in Phoenix, is such a ride-or-die fan of President Biden that, on Valentine’s Day, she mailed him a card to say his vigor, not his age, would shape the presidential election. But after a week of panic attacks after his dismal debate performance, she felt compelled to send him another card. This one said: Thanks for everything, but it’s time to go. \nThe turmoil engulfing the Democratic Party had left them sleepdeprived and divided about a path forward, with some saying it would be pragmatic to dump Mr. Biden and others arguing that he was Democrats’ best — or only? — option in November. \nSeveral voters said Vice President Kamala Harris was the Continued on Page A15 \nIn 80 interviews at Independence Day parades, pie-eating contests and political events this holiday in the political battlegrounds of Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, more than half of voters who had supported Mr. Biden in 2020 now said he should drop out of the race. About a quarter said he should stay in. The rest were unsure. \n# \nThings should have been settled. The weary delegates should have already chosen a presidential nominee, packed up their Welcome to New York souvenirs and returned home in time for the nation’s celebration of what it stood for. \nInstead, the study in indecision that was the Democratic National Convention of 1924 staggered through the Fourth of July week\nDemocratic delegates supporting Al Smith, who called the Ku Klux Klan a threat to democracy. \n# \nVoters in Swing States Express Frustration \n# \nOne of America’s political parties has a presidential candidate who is really old and showing it. The other has a presidential candidate who is a convicted felon, adjudicated sexual abuser, business fraudster and selfdescribed aspiring dictator for a day. And also really old. One of the parties is up in arms about its nominee and trying to figure out how to replace him at the last minute. The other is not. \nThe spectacle of the week since the nationally televised debate between President Biden end, its 3,000 delegates all but ensnared in the red-white-and-blue bunting adorning a tired Manhattan arena slated for demolition. The convention, which lasted 16 days and an astounding 103 ballots, is notorious both for being the longest in history and for being in\n\nBritain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, outside 10 Downing Street on Friday.

Trump has thrown into sharp relief two political parties that agreed to be led by flawed putative nominees whose vulnerabilities have become even more painfully apparent just months before the election. But the distinction of recent weeks has been striking. After Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 fected by the Ku Klux Klan, which cast a long shadow over the America of that time. Just a few dozen miles to the south, it was celebrating a white-nationalist Independence Day with a hood-and-robe parade right down the Broadway of a beachside New Jersey city. The simultaneous events reflected the divide over what it meant to be an American.

Even though many Republican officeholders and strategists privately loathe him, they fell in line and made clear they would stick with him no matter how many scandals piled up. \nBut not in Japan. While renowned for its consumer electronics giants, robots and some of the world’s fastest broadband networks, the country has also been wedded to floppy disks and other old technologies like fax machines and cash. \nThe floppy disk, invented in the 1970s, was once a ubiquitous part of computing. Other forms of memory like flash drives and internet cloud storage have since taken over. In the 1990s, along with the cassette tape, it was inching toward the dustbin of outdated tech. \nWhen he encountered an image of a highway billboard for an American cancer clinic that read, “If you know what a floppy disk is it may be time for your cancer screening,” Mr. Kono responded Continued on Page A10 \nANDREW TESTA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \nJapan scrapped every regulation requiring the use of floppy disks for administrative purposes this week, catching up with the times 13 years after the country’s producers manufactured their last units. \nJapan began moving away from the 1900s storage devices, magnetic disks encased in plastic, just two years ago, when Taro Kono, the country’s digital minister, declared a “war on floppy disks.” \nThis article is by John Yoon, Hisako Ueno and Kiuko Notoya. \n# \n\nColombia — home to more species than any other area on Earth — is now more open to birders after a peace treaty.

A sardonic cartoon franchise that he helped create, “Masameer,” likened to a Saudi version of “South Park,” was soon streaming to audiences around the world. And as the conservative Islamic kingdom loosened up, Mr. Almuzaini was being publicly celebrated — as recently as a few months ago — as one of the homegrown talents shaping its nascent entertainment industry. \nMr. Almuzaini, a dual U.S.-Saudi citizen and father of three, recently described his plight in a video pleading for the Saudi leadership to intervene, saying that he was awaiting a final ruling from the kingdom’s Supreme Court.   \n“I might bear the consequences of what happens after this, and I’m ready,” he said in the 18- minute video, which he said he \nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia — From the outside, the last few years looked like the peak of Abdulaziz Almuzaini’s career. \nBehind the scenes, though, he was on trial in an opaque national security court, as Saudi prosecutors — who accused him of promoting extremism through the cartoon series and social media posts — sought to ensure that he would spend the rest of his life in prison or under a travel ban. \nContinued on Page A7 \n# \nThe thundering mutiny of the voters may have been the single biggest message of Britain’s election. It has ushered in a new era of Labour government, left the Conservatives to nurse the worst defeat in their history, and stands as a warning to incumbents everywhere of the hazards of failing to deliver on your promises. \nAt one level, Britain’s embrace of a center-left party sets it apart from the right-wing wave that is rising across Europe and possibly in the United States. When Mr. Starmer travels to Washington next week for a NATO sum\nIt all added up to a complex election that defies easy categorization: a landslide, but not a straightforward realignment of the political map; a pivot to the center-left, but one that gave the populist right a valuable foothold; a thumping Labour win, but without the euphoria that suffused Tony Blair’s runaway victory in 1997. “A loveless landslide,” one commentator said on Friday morning. \nBut Labour’s triumph was only one of several crosscurrents that revealed the extraordinary volatility of the modern British electorate: the rise of Reform U.K., an insurgent anti-immigration party, which won more than four million votes; the plummeting vote share of the major parties; the lowest voter turnout in decades, and the flare-up of the Gaza War as a campaign issue that stung Labour candidates, even Mr. Starmer. \nWhile he comfortably held his own seat in London, Mr. Starmer won 17,000 fewer votes than in 2019, thanks in part to a challenge by an independent who channeled anger on the left over Labour’s stance on Israel and the war in Gaza. \nLONDON — Britain’s voters handed the Labour Party a landslide election victory this week, but one laden with asterisks. \nPrime Minister Keir Starmer took office on Friday with a commanding majority in the British Parliament, yet in terms of the total number of ballots cast, his party won only a third of the vote, less than what it got in 2017 when it lost to the Conservatives. Labour made inroads across Britain, yet its wins were often eclipsed by the Tory losses, including that of Liz Truss, the unpopular former prime minister who was evicted from her seat. \n“We wanted change,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London, summing up the complicated state of British politics, “but we aren’t inspired by Labour.” \n# \nOlder U.K. Parties Lose Support to Newcomers \nContinued on Page A10 \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \nARTS C1-6 \nBolsonaro Accused of Theft Brazil’s former president may soon face criminal charges for stealing gifts from the Saudis.
