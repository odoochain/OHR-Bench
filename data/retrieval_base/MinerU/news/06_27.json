Pages A6-7. \n# \n# \nSAN FRANCISCO — Last July, Google made an eight-word change to its privacy policy that represented a significant step in its race to build the next generation of artificial intelligence. \nBuried thousands of words into its document, Google tweaked the phrasing for how it used data for its products, adding that public information could be used to train its A.I. chatbot and other services. \n# \nWe use publicly available information to help train Google’s language AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. \nThe subtle change was not unique to Google. As companies look to train their A.I. models on data that is protected by privacy laws, they’re carefully rewriting their terms and conditions to include words like “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning” and “generative A.I.” \nSome changes to terms of service are as small as a few words. Others include the addition of entire sections to explain how generative A.I. models work, and the types of access they have to user data. Snap, for instance, warned its users not to share confidential information with its A.I. chatbot because it would be used in its training, and Meta alerted users in Europe that public posts on Facebook and Instagram would soon be used to train its large language model. \n# \n# \nFour years later, Mr. Bowman’s decisive loss on Tuesday will soon brand him with a more ignominious distinction: the first member of the House’s left-leaning “Squad” to be ousted from office. The congressman was weighed \nRepresentative Jamaal Bowman’s upset win in a 2020 Democratic primary in the New York suburbs was heralded by the left as proof of its electoral ascent in American politics. \n# \ndown by a unique collection of baggage, including a guilty plea to a misdemeanor for pulling a House fire alarm last year. And he faced record-shattering spending by political groups furious over his criticism of Israel. \nBut his defeat in one of the nation’s most closely watched primaries drove home an unmistakable reality: Even at a moment when the war in Gaza has re-energized progressive activism, many of the left’s candidates are no longer gaining ground in major races, and in some cases they have started losing it. \n\nIn party primaries and special elections from Oregon to New Jersey, moderates seemed to be regaining their footing, often by explicitly positioning themselves to the right of their Democratic opponents on immigration, foreign policy and public safety. President Biden has also tacked rightward on key issues like immigration. \n\nPossible ‘Chip’ for a Prisoner Exchange The trial for Evan Gershkovich, an American reporter arrested 15 months ago, began Wednesday in a court near Moscow. Page A8. \n“The voters in this district, and in other districts across the country, frankly, are just not buying some of the things that these candidates are selling,” said Jay Jacobs, New York’s Democratic Party chair, who has often been at war with his party’s left wing. “And now, moderate voters are getting engaged, they’re paying attention and they’re coming to the polls.” \nThe outcome left progressives on the defensive on Wednesday, with longtime allies at odds over who was to blame and how — if at all — their movement needed to change its message and confrontational style to meet a different moment in American politics. Other Democratic moderates in New York also were victorious on Tuesday, including John Avlon — whose political background included a stint as a speechwriter and adviser to Rudolph W. Giuliani — who won a House primary in eastern Long Island. But Mr. Continued on Page A20 \nAnd in Missouri, another member of the “Squad,” Representative Cori Bush, is in danger of losing an August primary, where many of the same forces that helped defeat Mr. Bowman are already at play. \n“We’re being destroyed already left, right and center by inferior content that is basically trained on our stuff, and now we’re being discarded,” said Sasha Yanshin, a YouTube personality and cofounder of a travel recommendation site. \nThose terms and conditions — which many people have long ignored — are now being contested by some users who are writers, illustrators and visual artists and worry that their work is being used to train the products that threaten to replace them. \nThis month, Mr. Yanshin canceled his Adobe subscription over Continued on Page A24 \n# \n# \nThis spring, 30 ninth-graders from a progressive private school near Greenwich Village went on a field trip. \nThere was nothing unusual about venturing out into New York City to boost their classroom studies.

Afterward, parents were flabbergasted to learn where the students were taken, and what they were told. \n\nDuring their visit, a People’s Forum employee gave the students a 90-minute lecture on the perils of America’s support for Israel and Ukraine.

What was Chuck Schumer thinking? \nThe Democrats had just temporarily averted a national default with Republican aid but still needed a broader deal to resolve a debt ceiling clash. Yet there was Mr. Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, on the floor bashing Republicans for playing $^{66}\\mathrm{a}$ dangerous and risky partisan game.” Mr. Biden called Mr. Schumer to chide him. That was not helpful, the president said, according to an official informed about the call, which came late in Mr. Biden’s first year in office. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, had backed down to help avoid a fiscal crisis. They should not rub his nose in it. Mr. Schumer pushed back. “You don’t know how much he’s been beating up on me,” he told the president. \nThe Joe Biden who will defend his presidency at a nationally televised debate on Thursday night remains a practitioner of oldschool politics in a new-school era. The hostility, the anger, the polarization, the “beating up” that define today’s national debate, yes, he knows all about that. \nBut after more than half a century in Washington, he still has the instincts of a backslapping cloakroom pol, eager to make deals and work across the aisle where possible at a time when that rarely seems rewarded anymore. \nIn some ways, it has been a formula for success that upended expectations, resulting in a raft of landmark liberal programs that will mark Mr. Biden in the history books as one of the most prolific legislative masters since Lyndon \nContinued on Page A22 \n\nDEBATE A look back on televised presidential face-offs, including Richard Nixon’s sweaty contest with John F.

Upset by Removal of Posts Cited as Being Misinformation \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court handed the Biden administration a major practical victory on Wednesday, rejecting a Republican challenge that sought to prevent the government from contacting social media platforms to combat what it said was misinformation. \nThe court ruled that the states and users who had challenged those interactions had not suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sue. \nThe decision, by a 6-to-3 vote, left for another day fundamental questions about what limits the First Amendment imposes on the government’s power to influence the technology companies that are the main gatekeepers of information in the internet era. \nThe case arose from a barrage of communications from administration officials urging platforms to take down posts on topics like the coronavirus vaccine and claims of election fraud. The attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, both Republicans, sued, along with three doctors, the owner of a right-wing website that frequently traffics in conspiracy theories and an activist concerned that Facebook had suppressed her posts on the supposed side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. \n“The plaintiffs, without any concrete link between their injuries and the defendants’ conduct, ask us to conduct a review of the yearslong communications between dozens of federal officials, across different agencies, with different social media platforms, about different topics,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority. “This court’s standing doctrine prevents us from exercising such general legal oversight of the other branches of government.” \nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch, dissented. \n“For months,” Justice Alito wrote, “high-ranking government officials placed unrelenting pressure on Facebook to suppress Americans’ free speech. Because the court unjustifiably refuses to address this serious threat to the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent.” \nhe White House welcomed th Continued on Page A18 \n# \n# \nNAIROBI, Kenya — In a sudden reversal, President William Ruto of Kenya announced on Wednesday that he would not sign a finance bill that he had long said would stabilize the country’s economy — a response to devastating protests a day earlier that left nearly two dozen people dead. Though the precise toll was still being tallied, human rights groups said that 23 people were killed and over 300 others injured after the police used tear gas and bullets to respond to demonstrators who had marched on Parliament to protest the tax increases in the bill. \nSome people broke into the Parliament building and set it on fire hours after lawmakers voted to pass the legislation. The death toll makes Tuesday’s violence one of the bloodiest days in the country’s recent history. \n\n“Listening keenly to the people of Kenya who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this finance bill, I concede, and therefore, I will not sign the 2024 finance bill, and it shall subsequently be withdrawn,” Mr. Ruto said in an address to the country on Wednesday. \nAmong those sitting behind him were lawmakers who, just a day earlier, had passed the bill in Parliament, some while being loudly condemned by their constituents for supporting the legislation. \nThe announcement was a Continued on Page A12 \n\n# \nAbortion Ban May Be Lifted The Supreme Court appears poised to temporarily allow emergency abortions in Idaho when a woman’s health is at risk.
