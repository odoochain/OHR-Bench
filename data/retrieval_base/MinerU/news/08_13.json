But the number could have been much higher. \nMore than 47,000 Europeans died from heat-related causes during 2023, the world’s hottest year on record, a new report in \nWithout heat adaptation measures over the past two decades, the death toll for Europeans experiencing the same temperatures at the start of the 21st century could have been 80 percent higher, according to the new study. For people over 80 years old, the toll could have doubled. \nSome of the measures include advances in health care, more widespread air-conditioning and improved public information that kept people indoors and hydrated amid extreme temperatures. \nThe researchers used an epidemiological model to analyze the deaths alongside 2023 weekly temperature records to estimate what fraction of deaths could be attributable to heat. \n“We’re quickly approaching the limits to what the human body can withstand,” said Jordan Clark, a senior policy associate at Duke University’s Heat Policy Innovation Hub who was not involved in the study. As the planet continues to warm, he said, “we’re racing against the clock.” \n“We need to consider climate change as a health issue,” said Elisa Gallo, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, a nonprofit research center. “We still have thousands of deaths caused by heat every year, so we still have to work a lot, and we have to work faster.” \nCounting deaths from extreme heat is difficult, in part because death certificates don’t always reflect the role of heat. The study used publicly available death records from 35 countries, provided by Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union, and representing about 543 million Europeans. \n“Yeah, gotcha,” Mr. Bernstein said. \nSteps to Adapt Saved Thousands of Lives \n“I’m a psychiatrist,” he said, “but I can’t treat your depression over the internet.” \nA few minutes into his first livestreamed conversation with Byron Bernstein, Dr. Alok Kanojia got his caveats out of the way.

The Vietnam War was over, and a force once staffed with drafted troops who had fought and died in the jungles of Southeast Asia was transitioning to ranks filled solely with volunteers. \nDAVID GUTTENFELDER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \nSAVANNAH, Ga. — The federal government is processing citizenship requests at the fastest clip in a decade, moving rapidly through a backlog that built up during the Trump administration and the coronavirus pandemic. \nA naturalization ceremony last month in Savannah, Ga., where 32 immigrants became citizens. \n# \nIn Savannah, Ga., people from 19 countries streamed into a federal courthouse recently to take the oath of allegiance. “My case was done in less than six months,” said Gladis Brown, who is married to an American and emigrated from Honduras in 2018. \nMr. Walz, now Minnesota governor and the presumptive Democratic candidate for vice president, raised his hand to join the Army National Guard just two days past his 17th birthday on April 8, 1981. In a career in the military that spanned three decades, he battled floods, managed an artillery unit and achieved one of the \nGeorgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. \nGenerally, lawful permanent residents, known as green-card holders, are eligible to become naturalized citizens if they have had that status for at least five \n# \nIn Nebraska, Tim Walz was one of those volunteers. \nhighest enlisted ranks in the Army. He also navigated a fulltime job teaching social studies alongside his part-time military occupation as an enlisted combat arms soldier, a role that trained years, or have been married to a U.S. citizen for at least three years. \n\n# \nAfter the ceremony, Ms. Brown celebrated with cake and punch from a local women’s volunteer group — and by completing a voter-registration form provided by a representative of the League of Women Voters. \nGreen-card holders have many of the same rights as citizens. But voting in federal elections is a right accorded only to citizens. And that can be a powerful motivation to pursue citizenship, especially when big national elections are on the horizon. \n“I’m so glad that the process moved quickly,” said Ms. Brown, who was one of the 31 immigrants being sworn in. “People like me want to vote in the election.” \nContinued on Page A11 \n# \nThe stress has pushed many public servants to resign or retire; in Wisconsin alone, the state association of county clerks found that 31 of its 72 members had never administered a presidential election, with most entering office after their predecessors left mid-term. The remaining officials, many of them overwhelmed and very tired, are once again marshaling their limited resources to try to \nELECTION TRUST WANES\n“Anytime there’s a big event, that’s an opportunity for bad actors to seize on that and act on it,” said Ms. Fall, 30. “It’s our job to make sure we’re answering those questions effectively and communicating to our voters.” \nThe implications for Ms. Fall’s workload will not be good, she said, noting that conspiracy theories can make it harder to reach constituents who already find elections to be mystifying, like “magical” events. \nIncreasingly, her generation of elections officials must multitask as defenders against disinformation and its consequences. On any given day, they are debunking claims that masses of dead people are contaminating the voting pool or that mail-in balloting is susceptible to fraud. In just the past year, they have been flooded with inane demands for details about their employees, faced harassment campaigns targeted at their female family members, received intimidating letters laced with fentanyl and been subjected to fake threats of bombings and break-ins. \nTate Fall is overwhelmed. When she signed on to be director of elections in Cobb County, Ga., last year, she knew she’d be registering voters and recruiting poll workers, maybe fixing up voting machines. \nShe didn’t expect the unending flood of disinformation — or at least, she wasn’t prepared for how much it would overtake her job. She has had election deniers shout at her at public meetings, fielded weekend calls from politicians panicked about a newly circulating falsehood, and even reviewed conspiracy theories circulating on Nextdoor forums that might worsen skepticism among distrustful constituents already doubtful that the democratic system is reliable and secure. \nMr. Walz never went to war. Most of his service covered a period when America was bruised from foreign entanglements and wary of sending troops into combat overseas for long stretches. And it ended when Mr. Walz was 41, as the military ramped up for war after Sept. 11. \nIn the weeks since former President Donald J. Trump was targeted in an assassination attempt and Kamala Harris replaced President Biden as the Democratic nominee, adding Tim Walz to the ticket, conspiracy theories have surged. The claims were pushed by pundits and politicians like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican known for promoting far-right conspiracy theories, who represents part of Ms. Fall’s jurisdiction. \nAnd that was before the election went sideways. \n# \nDismayed by Threats and Conspiracy Theories, Many Leave Posts \nince being picked as Vice PresContinued on Page A10 \nContinued on Page A12 \n# \n\n# \nA Nazi Villa No One Wants What do you do with the former estate of Joseph Goebbels?
