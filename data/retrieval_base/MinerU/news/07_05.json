Vogel, Theodore Schleifer and Lauren Hirsch. \nAfter several days of quiet griping and hoping that President Biden would abandon his re-election campaign on his own, many wealthy Democratic donors are trying to take matters into their own hands. \nWielding their fortunes as both carrot and stick, donors have undertaken a number of initiatives to pressure Mr. Biden to step down from the top of the ticket and help lay the groundwork for an alternate candidate. \nThe efforts — some coordinated, some conflicting and others still nascent — expose a remarkable and growing rift between the party’s contributor class and its standard-bearer that could have an impact on down-ballot races, whether or not the donors influence Mr. Biden’s decision. \nThe president on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to stay in the race amid criticism of his weak debate performance last week. But that has not placated donors or strategists who worry that he cannot win in November. \nA group of them is working to raise as much as \\$100 million for a sort of escrow fund, called the Next Generation PAC, that would be used to support a replacement candidate. If Mr. Biden does not step aside, the money could be used to help down-ballot candidates, according to people close to the effort. \nSupporters of potential replaceContinued on Page A14 \nMARY TURNER FOR THE NEW YORK TIME ,The reaction at a bar in Walthamstow, England, to exit poll results on Thursday.

Shear and Thomas Fuller. \nJERUSALEM — American and Israeli officials on Thursday expressed renewed optimism over a cease-fire deal in the Gaza Strip, after Hamas revised its position and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel then told President Biden that he was sending a new delegation of negotiators to the stalled talks. \nWhite House officials said they believed new progress in the talks amounted to what one repeatedly called $^{66}\\mathrm{a}$ breakthrough” in the monthslong negotiations, though they said that it would take some time to work out the many steps involved in implementing the truce. Israeli and other officials involved in the talks agreed that there had been progress but described it in more cautious terms. The discussions are based on a three-stage framework deal publicized by President Biden in late May and endorsed by the United Nations. If carried out, the agree\n\n# \nment would ultimately stipulate an end to the war, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and for Hamas and its allies to release the remaining 120 living and dead hostages in Gaza for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. \nThe official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivities of the negotiations, compared the current situation to the deal that was reached in Novem\nA senior Biden administration official directly involved in the talks said that there is broad agreement now about the steps required to transition from phase one, a temporary cease-fire, to phase two, a permanent end to the fighting and a release of the remaining living hostages. \nContinued on Page A10 \n# \n# \nKYIV, Ukraine — In a field on the outskirts of Kyiv, the founders of Vyriy, a Ukrainian drone company, were recently at work on a weapon of the future. \nTo demonstrate it, Oleksii Babenko, 25, Vyriy’s chief executive, hopped on his motorcycle and rode down a dirt path. Behind him, a drone followed, as a colleague tracked the movements from a briefcase-size computer. \nUntil recently, a human would have piloted the quadcopter. No longer. Instead, after the drone locked onto its target — Mr. Babenko — it flew itself, guided by software that used the machine’s camera to track him. \nThe motorcycle’s growling engine was no match for the silent drone as it stalked Mr. Babenko. “Push, push more. Pedal to the metal, man,” his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the \nFear of New Arms Race Raises the Stakes of an Ethics Debate \ndrone swooped toward him. “You’re screwed, screwed!” If the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his colleagues hadn’t disengaged the autonomous tracking, Mr. Babenko would have been a goner. \nVyriy is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weaponization of consumer technology, driven by the war with Russia. The pressure to outthink the enemy, along with huge flows of investment, donations and government contracts, has turned Ukraine into a Silicon Valley for autonomous drones and other weaponry. \nContinued on Page A6 \n\nGRAHAM DICKIE/THE NEW YORK TIMES \nA Day for Dogs, Hot and Otherwise Dressed for excess, Julie and Garrett Brown, and Dorsett, took in the Nathan’s contest.

And the students were not stoking hatred of China; they were swearing an oath to play fair at what looked like a sporting event. The video wasn’t taken down until after it had been viewed more than 10 million times. Xenophobic online content like the schoolyard video is the subject of debate in China right now Last month, a Chinese man stabbed a Japanese mother and her son in eastern China. Two weeks earlier, four visiting instructors from a college in Iowa were stabbed in northeastern China.

The chant, still shouted at protests by the left, is $\\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}}^{6}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{a}$ jeunesse emmerde le Front National,” which cannot be translated well without curse words, but essentially tells the far right to get lost. \nThat crude battle cry is emblematic of what had been conventional wisdom not only in France, but also elsewhere — that young people often tilt left in their politics. Now, that notion has been challenged as increasing numbers of young people have joined swaths of the French electorate to support the National Rally, a party once deemed too extreme to govern. \nThe results from Sunday’s parliamentary vote, the first of a twopart election, showed young people across the political spectrum coming out to cast ballots in much greater numbers than in previous years.
