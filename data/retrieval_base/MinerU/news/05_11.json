Trump imposed on more than \\$300 billion of Chinese imports in 2018. Most of the Trump tariffs are expected to remain in place, but Mr. Biden plans to go beyond those by raising levies in areas that the president showered with subsidies in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. \nThat includes Chinese electric vehicles, which currently face a 25 percent tariff. The administration is expected to raise that to as much as 100 percent in order to make it prohibitively expensive to buy a Chinese E.V. \nMr. Biden has previously raised concerns about Chinese electric vehicles, saying that internet-connected Chinese cars and trucks posed risks to national security because their operating systems could send sensitive information to Beijing. He took steps earlier this year to try and block those vehicles from entering the United States. \nThe president is looking to ratchet up pressure on China and demonstrate his willingness to protect American manufacturing ahead of his face-off against Mr. Trump in the November presidential election. \nThe fate of the China tariffs has been the subject of intense debate within the White House since Mr. Biden took office, with economic and political advisers often clashing over how to proceed. But this year China has begun ramping up production of the same products - electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar panels —that the Biden administration has been investing billions of dollars to start producing in the United States.

He had just been shown pictures of civilians killec by Israeli shelling, including a small baby with an arm blown off. He ordered aides to get the Israeli prime minister on the phone and then dressed him down sharply. \nThe president was Ronald Reagan, the year was 1982, and the battlefield was Lebanon, where Israelis were attacking Palestinian fighters. The conversation Mr. Reagan had with Prime Minister Menachem Begin that day, Aug. 12, would be one of the fewtimes aideseverheard the usually mild-mannered president so exercised. \nNonetheless, Mr. Reagan retorted, it had to stop. Mr. Begin heeded the demand. Twenty minutes later, he called back and told the president that he had ordered a halt to the shelling. “I didn't know I had that kind of power” Mr. Reagan marveled to aides afterward. \n\"It is a holocaust, Mr. Reagan told Mr. Begin angrily. Mr. Begin, whose parents and brother were killed by the Nazis snapped back, “Mr. President, 1 know all about a holocaust.\" \nIt would not be the only time he would use it to rein in Israel. In fact, Mr. Reagan used the power of American arms several times to influence Israeli war policy, at different points ordering warplanes and cluster munitions to be delayed or withheld. His actions take on new meaning four decades later, as President Biden delays a shipment of bombs and threatens to withhold other offensive weapons from Israel if it attacks Rafah, in southern Gaza. \nEven as Republicans rail against Mr. Biden, accusing him of abandoning an ally in the middle of a war, supporters of the president's decision pointed to the Reagan precedent. If it was reasonable for the Republican presidential icon to limit arms to impose his will on Israel, they argue, it should be acceptable for the current Democratic president to do the same. \nContinued on Page All \n# \nSEES LIKELY VIOLATIONS \nBut State Dept. Finds No Hard Proof of Human Rights Breaches \n# \nWASHINGTON - The Biden administration believes that Israel has most likely violated international standards in failing to protect civilians in Gaza but has not found specific instances that would justify the withholding of military aid, the State Departmant told Concracc on Eridau \nIn the administration's most detailed assessment of Israel's conduct in Gaza, the State Department said in a written report that Israel \"has the knowledge, experience and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian ii+ai1i+ \nBut it added that \"the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions\" as to whether \n\nPresident Biden ordered the report on Israel's conduct. \nthe Israel Defense Forces are making sufficient use of those tools. \nEven so, the report — which seemed at odds with itself in places — said the U.S.had no hard proof of Israeli violations. It noted the difficulty of collecting reliable information from Gaza, Hamas's tactic of operating in civilian areas, and the fact that “Israel has not shared complete information to verify” whether U.S. weapons have been used in specific incidents alleged to have involved human rights law violations. \nThe report, mandated by PresiContinued on Page A9 \nContinued on Page A9 \n# \nThis article is by Marc Santora, Maria VarenikovaandEric Schmitt. \nKYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine rushed reinforcements to its northern border on Friday after Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian lines along several sections, applying new pressure on forces already stretched thin along a 600-mile front. \nThe Russian assaults began around 5 a.m. Friday with massive shelling and aerial bombardments of Ukrainian positions followed by armored columns trying to punch through at several points along the border, according to a statement fromUkraine's Ministry of Defense. \n\"As of now, these attacks have been repelled, and battles of varying intensity are ongoing’” the ministry said. “To strengthen the defense in this sector of the front, reserve units have been deployed.\" \n\nThe breadth and intent of the Russian border incursions remained unclear. Military analysts have said Russia may be trying to force Ukraine to expend valuable resources in defending the region just as Russian assaults ineastern Ukraine are intensifying. \nBut a senior Ukrainian commander, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the current state of fighting, said on Friday that the Russian attacks went beyond probing or intelligence gathering. The commander said the Kremlin's immediate goal appeared to be to create a buffer Continued onPageA7 \nINVESTIGATIoN A TimeS analysis shows Russia upgrading a Cold War-era site in Belarus.

He was 86. \nAfter publishing breakthrough studies in mathematics that would play a seminal role in quantum field theory, string theory and condensed matter physics, Mr. Simons decided to apply his genius to a more prosaic subject — making as much money as he could in as short a time as possible. \nSo at age 40 he opened a storefront office in a Long Island strip mall and set about proving that trading commodities, currencies, stocks and bonds could be nearly as predictable as calculus and partial differential equations. Spurning financial analysts and business school graduates, he hired like-minded mathematicians and scientists. \n\nMr. Simons equipped his colleagues with advanced computers to process torrents of data filtered through mathematical models, and turned the four investment funds in his new firm, Renaissance Technologies, into virtual money printing machines.

Ms. Berrie reported that the Russell Berrie Foundation, named for her late husband, had scheduled three grant payments to Columbia. \nBut after months of campus protests around the Israel-Hamas war, Ms. Berrie also delivered a warning. \nAs the foundation prepared to transfer almost \\$613,000, Ms. Berrie told Dr. Shafik that future giving would partly hinge on “evidence that you and leaders across the university are taking appropriate steps to create a tolerant and secure environment for Jewish members of the Columbia community\" \nMonths passed, and the foundation, which has donated about \\$86 million to Columbia over the years, did not like what it saw. Frustrated and flummoxed by the sustained tumult at Columbia, the foundation suspended its giving to the university late last month. \n\nColumbia has spent months under siege, bombarded by public demands from protesters, faculty members, alumni, members of Congress and religious groups since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that precipitated the war. But the foundation's admonition, included in correspondence that it shared with The New York Times, illustrates the pressures that Columbia administrators have also had to confront in private with donors, with longstanding relationships and enormous sums at stake. \nThe Berrie Foundation's pause threatens to cost Columbia tens of Continued on Page A18 \n\n# \nRanger Overcomes Injury After a six-month layoff, Filip Chytil took the ice, absorbed a hit and a stick to the face, and felt at home.
