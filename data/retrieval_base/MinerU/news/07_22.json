Trump from returning to the White House. \nMr. Biden then posted a subsequent online message endorsing Ms. Harris. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” he wrote. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.” \nThe president’s decision upended the race and set the stage for a raucous and unpredictable campaign unlike any in modern times, leaving Ms. Harris just 107 days to consolidate support from Democrats, establish herself as a credible national leader and prosecute the case against Mr. Trump. Recent polls have shown her competitive with and even slightly ahead of Mr. Trump. \nAlthough Democratic convention delegates must ratify the choice of Ms. Harris to take over as standard-bearer next month, Mr. Biden’s endorsement meant the nomination was hers to lose and she appeared in a powerful position to claim it. While Mr. Biden, 81, remained president and still planned to finish out his term in January, the transition of the campaign to Ms. Harris, 59, amounted to a momentous generational change of leadership of the Democratic Party. \nThe president said he would “speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision,” although it was not clear when he would do that as he re\nContinued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, who has struggled for nearly four years in President Biden’s shadow, was thrust on Sunday into the center of a remarkable political drama that could culminate with her becoming the first woman of color at the top of a major-party presidential ticket. \nMr. Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid and endorse Ms. Harris to succeed him puts her in a powerful, but not certain, position to become the new face of the Democratic Party, charged with preventing former President Donald J. Trump from returning to the Oval Office for another four years. \n“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump,” Mr. Biden wrote in a social media post after he announced his decision to step aside. “Let’s do this.” Ms. Harris and her team are likely to move swiftly to try to seize that mantle even as uncertainty swirled about whether other Democrats would seek to Continued on Page A15 \nERIN SCHAFF/THE NEW YORK TIMES Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to win the nomination. \n\nFor now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected.

And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. \n# \n# \n# \nThis article is by Patricia Mazzei, Mitch Smith and Heather Knight. \nMIAMI — For Democratic voters who have spent much of the summer brooding about President Biden’s fitness for office, his decision on Sunday not to seek reelection came as a relief. Now, they figured, their political party might stand a chance in November — though many still expressed deep doubts. \n“I’m overjoyed, absolutely overjoyed,” said Mark Oliver Rylance, 67, a Democrat from Columbus, Ohio, said about Mr. Biden’s announcement. Just last weekend, Mr. Rylance participated in a demonstration outside of the Ohio Democratic Party convention calling for Mr. Biden to step aside. \n\n“If Biden had stayed in, we would have lost absolutely everything,” he added, echoing the feelings of many Democrats. “We would have lost the House, would have lost the Senate, and it could \n# \nvery well have been a landslide.” The delicate subjects of whether Mr. Biden, 81, was fit for another term and how long he might stay in the race after his disastrous debate performance last month had found their way into conversations at dinner parties, neighborhood parks and church gatherings. The end of Mr. Biden’s candidacy on Sunday shifted some Democrats’ emotions from profound anxiety to hopeful determination, even if what comes next for their party remains unclear. There was also plenty of resignation to the idea that no Democrat might be able to pull off a victory against former President Donald J. Trump. \n\nMr. Biden’s endorsement of Continued on Page A16 \nDemocratic donors are immedi  \nately mobilizing around Kamala   \nHarris as their party’s next presi  \ndential nominee, offering Demo  \ncratic elites something they have   \nnot felt in weeks. Optimism \nAdvisers and major givers said on Sunday that they were being inundated with enthusiasm and word of planned donations to support Ms. Harris if she became the official Democratic candidate — even as questions remained about how to best support her. Shortly before 5 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday afternoon, the Biden campaign filed paperwork formally renaming its campaign committee “Harris for President.” \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of President Biden’s decision to exit the race, Ms. Harris was enjoying some broad, swift consolidation among major givers. Multiple Biden donors and their advisers said that they were hearing from previously despondent donors who were ready to give to support a Harris-led ticket.
