But not everyone in Iran was in mourning. \n# \n# \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — The sequence of events that led to the killing of Jason Keys was so confounding that friends and family did not quite believe it until they saw the video evidence played in court. \nMr. Keys and his wife, Charae Williams Keys, were getting into their car after a Father’s Day visit in 2021 with her grandparents in a leafy neighborhood near Walnut Hill Park in Columbus, Ohio. A 72- year-old neighbor carrying a rifle accosted them in the belief, he later told the police, that Mr. Keys had let the air out of his daughter’s tires and poisoned his lawn. \nMr. Keys, who was carrying a \n# \npistol in his waistband, and his father-in-law tried to disarm the man, knocking him to the ground, while another relative ran back inside to get a .22 rifle. While Ms. Keys ducked behind the car to call 911, she heard multiple gunshots. She emerged to find her husband mortally wounded. \nIt took a moment for everyone to realize that the shots had come from a fourth gun across the street. Elias Smith, a 24-year-old ex-Marine, had stepped to his \nIt was an encounter emblematic of gun violence in America today, a dispute that might not have turned deadly but for firearms in increasingly easy reach.

Within seconds, he opened fire, hitting Mr. Keys five times. \n“What are you shooting for?” a relative of Mr. Keys can be heard asking on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident. Mr. Smith answered, “I don’t know.” \n\n\nJASON ANDREW FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \n# \nThe Dali, which crashed into a bridge in Baltimore, was guided back to a berth Monday.

Bromwich, Ben Protess and Maggie Haberman. \nOn a pivotal day in the first criminal trial of an American president, the courtroom threatened to spin out of control. \nThe prosecution’s star witness, Michael D. Cohen, admitted on the stand to stealing from former President Donald J. Trump’s company. Mr. Trump’s courtroom entourage included three supporters charged with felonies of their own. \n# \nAnd the defense’s only real witness was so defiant that the judge, after excoriating him, cleared the courtroom. \nThe trial’s first five weeks featured dramatic descriptions of sex and scandal, and the final phase of testimony on Monday showed no signs of a letup, as the courtroom played host to a nonstop spectacle. \n\nThe tension came to a head after the prosecution rested its case and the defense called its witness, Robert J. Costello, a lawyer who had once advised Mr. Cohen. The defense saw Mr. Costello as a foil to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s onetime personal lawyer and longtime henchman. \nBut the strategy may not have paid off: The judge promptly lost his patience with Mr. Costello, a Continued on Page A13 \n# \n# \nJERUSALEM — The chief prosecutor at the world’s top criminal court on Monday announced that he was seeking arrest warrants for the leaders of both Israel and Hamas on charges of crimes against humanity, a strong rebuke that equated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with his Hamas counterpart, Yahya Sinwar, and compounded the growing international alarm at Israel’s conduct in Gaza. \nIn a statement, Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, said that after investigating Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s counterattack on Gaza he had decided to apply for arrest warrants for Mr. Sinwar, Hamas’s leader within Gaza; Muhammad Deif, Hamas’s military leader; and Ismail Haniyeh, the movement’s Qatarbased political leader. Mr. Khan also said he was requesting warrants for Mr. Netanyahu and for Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant. \nWhile Mr. Khan’s request must still be approved by judges from the court, the announcement forms one of the harshest rebukes of Israel’s strategy in its sevenmonth campaign against Hamas that has killed tens of thousands of Gazan civilians. It also heightens scrutiny of Hamas’s actions at the start of the war in October, when Hamas fighters led a raid that killed more than 1,000 people and abducted hundreds more. \n“Today we once again underline that international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to all,” Mr. Khan said in his statement. “No foot soldier, no commander, no civilian leader — no one — can act with impunity.” \nFor now, the announcement is largely symbolic. Israel is not a member of the court and does not recognize its jurisdiction in Israel or Gaza, meaning that Israeli leaders would face no risk of arrest at home. \nJudges can also take months to uphold requests for arrest warrants. But if they do issue warrants, those named could be arrested if they travel to one of the court’s 124 member nations, which include most European countries but not the United States. \nMr. Khan’s decision to simultaneously pursue Israeli and Palestinian leaders was criticized by IsContinued on Page A8 \n# \nNEWS ANALYSIS \nWill Next President Tread Carefully? \nTehran Is Aiming to Project Stability Amid Tensions \n# \nThey funded Hamas and Hezbollah. They armed the Houthis, feeding the militia intelligence that fueled attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea. They cracked down on dissent at home, launched Iran’s first direct missile attacks on Israel, after Israel killed several Iranian generals, and turned Iran into a “threshold” nuclear state that could produce fuel for three or four bombs in short order. \nIn their three years in power, President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran and his equally hard-line foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, did everything they could to consolidate the “Axis of Resistance” against the United States and Israel. \nBut for all those aggressive moves, the two men, both killed in a helicopter crash in the mountains near Azerbaijan on Sunday, were also careful. \nLast week, days before their deaths, they approved talks with the United States through intermediaries aimed at making sure the war in Gaza was not the prelude to a wider war in the Middle East. And they stopped just short of making those bombs, at least as far as American intelligence agencies and international inspectors can determine. \nThe question now is whether their successors — almost certain to be from the same hardline camp, American officials suspect — will show similar caution. And whether, in the cauldron of internal Iranian power plays, and an all-consuming presidential election in the United States, it will even be possible to keep up the sliver of communications between Washington and Tehran. \n“The thing about Raisi was that he was the supreme leader’s man,” said Dennis Ross, the longtime Mideast negotiator, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 85-year-old head of state who has led the country since 1989. “He allows engagement, but no compromise. His team will inflict damage but keep it within bounds. They don’t want \nContinued on Page A8 \nThis article is by Farnaz Fassihi, Vivian Yee and Leily Nikounazar. \nIran sought to project a sense of order and control on Monday by quickly naming an acting president and foreign minister a day after a helicopter crash killed both leaders. The change in leadership came at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East and domestic discontent in Iran, where many residents have called for an end to decades of repressive clerical rule. \nIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced five days of mourning for the president, Ebrahim Raisi, 63, and the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, 60, who died when their helicopter plunged into a mountainous area near an Iranian city, Jolfa. The men had been returning from Iran’s border with Azerbaijan after inaugurating a joint dam project. \nIran’s Armed Forces said they had created a committee to investigate the crash, which state media attributed to a “technical failure.” \nAyatollah Khamenei on Monday named Iran’s first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, acting president and announced that Mr. Mokhber would organize elections for a new president within 50 days. A conservative political operative, Mr. Mokhber has a long history of involvement in large business conglomerates closely tied to the ayatollah. \nMr. Raisi, a hard-line cleric who came of age during the country’s Islamic Revolution, oversaw a deadly crackdown on protesters as the head of the judiciary in 2019 and as president in 2022. He was widely viewed as a possible successor to Ayatollah Khamenei, 85. \nIran’s cabinet appointed Ali Bagheri Kani, a deputy foreign minister, as the ministry’s “caretaker,” the IRNA state news agency reported. Mr. Bagheri Kani has served as Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator and was involved in a deal last year that freed imprisoned Americans in exchange for several jailed Iranians and eventual access to about \\$6 billion in Iranian funds. \nanian officials said there Continued on Page A6 \n# \nThe question of what is and what is not technically a sandwich grips us tightly. The question won’t die. But one day I will, and I can imagine \n\nthat the last thing I TEJAL hear will be some RAO gmuey  wehxyp laa ihniont gd toog is a sandwich, or why NCORTIETBICO’OSK a hamburger is a sandwich, or why my soul leaving my body as I breathe my last breath is also a sandwich. \n\nOn Monday, in Fort Wayne, Ind., a judge ruled that tacos are “Mexican-style sandwiches,” and while a local zoning issue might not usually make national headlines, it was impossible to resist this one. It took the absurd sandwich question seriously in a civil court case, then appeared to land on the wrong answer. \nI type these words from Los Angeles, where the question itself is trifling. There are many kinds of well-established, Mexican-style sandwiches here — cemitas, pambazos, dozens of \n\n# \nregional styles of tortas — and the taco is simply not one of them. The taco is its own glorious archetype, its own indisputable and formidable department of joy. But getting caught up in this argument is a bit of a distraction.
