This time they did not. Instead, they checked to make sure the boy’s cough was improving and his fever was gone — and then set off for New Jersey, not bothering to tell the grandparents about the incident. \nJason Moyer was days away from a family road trip to visit his parents when his 10-year-old son woke up with a fever and cough. Covid? \nIn the fifth summer of Covid, cases are surging, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported “high” or “very high” levels of the virus in wastewater in almost every state. The rate of hospitalizations with Covid is nearly twice what it was at this time last summer, and deaths — despite being down almost 75 percent from what they were at the worst of the pandemic — are still double what they were this spring. \nAs children return to schools and Labor Day weekend travel swells, the potential for further spread abounds. But for many like Mr. Moyer, Covid has become so normalized that they no longer see it as a reason to disrupt social, work or travel routines. Test kit sales have plummeted. Isolation after an exposure is increasingly rare. Masks — once a ubiquitous symbol of a Covid surge — are sparse, even in crowded airports, train stations and subways. \nHuman behavior is, of course, the reason that infections are \nAHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP — GETTY IMAGES Masks, once ubiquitous, are now infrequently seen. \nEpidemiologists said in interviews that they do not endorse a lackadaisical approach, particularly for those spending time around older people and those who are immunocompromised. They still recommend staying home for a couple of days after an soaring. But at some point, many reason, we need to live. \n\n“I no longer even know what the rules and recommendations are,” said Andrew Hoffman, 68, of Mission Viejo, Calif., who came down with respiratory symptoms a few weeks ago after his wife had tested positive for Covid. He skipped synagogue, but still went to the grocery store. \n“And since I don’t test, I can’t follow them,” he said. \nContinued on Page A14 \nLUIS ANTONIO ROJAS FOR THE NEW YORK TIME Court workers against a plan by Mexico’s president to overhaul the judiciary protested at the Supreme Court in Mexico City last week. \n# \n“Hopefully there will be a statement from them that they are going to be respectful of the independence of Mexico,” Mr. López Obrador said of the United States during his daily news conference. “As long as that doesn’t happen and they continue with that policy, then there is a pause with the embassy.” \n“‘Pause’ means that we are going to take a break,” he added, saying it would also extend to the U.S. State Department. But Mr. López Obrador said that overall relations would not be affected, seeking to allay concerns over a potential effect on trade. Mexico is the United States’ top trading partner, and there are growing concerns and warnings about the effect of the judicial reforms on business confidence and the economy. \nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico said on Tuesday that his government was “pausing” relations with the United States Embassy in response to criticism by the U.S. ambassador over the president’s push in the final weeks of his sixyear term to make changes to the judiciary, potentially forcing thousands of judges from their jobs. \nMEXICO CITY — For months, tensions have been building in Mexico over the president’s sweeping plans to overhaul the judiciary, shaking the country’s political system and straining diplomatic ties with the United States. This week, those tensions exploded into the open. \n# \nMr. López Obrador also announced a pause in relations with the Canadian Embassy after its Continued on Page A9 \n# \n# \nwhen it is her time to go, that’s God’s choosing, not hers,” Ms. Uphold said. “She was very adamant about that.” \nMarie Cooper led her life according to her Christian faith. She baked pies for her neighbors in northern West Virginia and said grace before even a bite of food. She watched Jimmy Swaggart, a televangelist preacher $^{\\mathrm{~-~a~}}$ little too loudly, in her daughter Sherry Uphold’s opinion. And she always said that at the end of her life, she did not want to be resuscitated. “My mother’s religious belief is \nLast winter, doctors found cancer cells in Ms. Cooper’s stomach. \n# \nShe’d had “do not resuscitate” and “do not intubate” orders on file for decades and had just filled out new copies, instructing medical staff to withhold measures to restart her heart if it stopped, and to never give her a breathing tube. In February, Ms. Cooper walked into the hospital for a routine stomach scope to determine the severity of the cancer. After the procedure, Ms. Uphold visited her mother in the recovery room and saw her in a panic. Despite having an oxygen tube in her nose, Ms. Cooper was gesturing as if she could not breathe. She was able to force out just one word at a time. Ms. Uphold called for help and was ushered to a waiting room while the medical team called an emergency code. Ms. Cooper grew even more distressed and “uncooperative,” according to medical records. Doctors restrained her and inserted a breathing tube down her throat, violating the wishes outlined in her medical chart. \n\nMs. Uphold, livid, confronted the doctors, who could not explain Continued on Page A16 \n\nFires in Brazil Threaten Wildlife Wildfires are laying waste to the Pantanal, a wetland and a vital biodiversity sanctuary.

While Mr. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, differ greatly in their campaign proposals, both of their parties are increasingly embracing tariffs as an essential tool in protecting American manufacturers from Chinese and other global competitors. \nIt has been a sharp reversal from previous decades, when most politicians fought to lower tariffs rather than raise them. But the loss of American manufacturing jobs as a result of globalization and China’s focus on churning out cheap exports have created a bipartisan backlash against more open trade. Given that Mr. Trump’s 2016 win capitalized on such sentiments, Democrats have been striving to avoid losing voters opposed to free trade. \nAt the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, Ms. Harris described the proposals as “a national sales tax — call it a Trump tax” — and said the plans “would raise prices on middleclass families by almost \\$4,000 a year.” \nWASHINGTON — When Donald J. Trump ran for president in 2016, there was not much love for tariffs in Washington. Many Republicans and Democrats believed that putting levies on imports created economic inefficiencies and that freer trade was the best recipe for growth. \nMs. Harris has sought to differentiate herself from Mr. Trump’s trade proposals, which include tariffs of 10 percent to 20 percent on most imports, as well as levies of more than 60 percent on China. Many economists say that level of tariffs would drive up prices for consumers, since companies would be likely to pass on higher import costs. \nMr. Iacovella said that Mr. Trump would most likely go further on tariffs than Ms. Harris would, but that no matter who won the election “it’s still going to be a tariffs administration, and an industrial policy one.” \nEconomists’ estimates vary, but the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund calculated that the tariffs could increase costs on a middle-income family by \\$3,900 per year. \n“On economic policy and trade issues, you have both major parties moving in the same direction,” said Nick Iacovella, a senior vice president at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates tariffs and domestic investments in industry. \nMs. Harris has not said much about how she would approach tariffs, including whether she would impose additional levies on China. But Charles Lutvak, a \nContinued on Page A11 \n# \n# \nSHANGHAI — For Shanghai’s lonely and retired, love is elusive. Divorced or widowed residents gather in a dating corner in People’s Park every weekend looking for a chat. They mill about an Ikea canteen on Tuesdays in search of some fun. \nThey arrive dressed a little nicer than usual, ready to talk about their virtues, their past lives and the future. \nLooking for a Spark at Shanghai Meet-Ups \n“I’m simple. I don’t smoke cigarettes or play mahjong,” said Xu Xiaoduo, 70, a twice-divorced former primary-school teacher who volunteers details about his pension (around \\$1,250 a month) and his dancing abilities (very good). “But,” he added with a sigh, “I can’t find true love.” Others share his frustrations, but downplay any yearning to find love. More than a few say they have lost hope. \n\nIt should not be this hard. There are more people in China who are 65 or older than there are in any other country. And Shanghai has more older adults than any other Chinese city. Most of these residents stopped working long ago because China has one of the lowest retirement ages in the world, \nContinued on Page A5 \n# \nThe Supreme Court term that ended this summer delivered a number of big wins for traditional conservative causes. The court made it easier to challenge federal regulations. It made it harder to prosecute former presidents. And it delivered another decision that expanded the rights of gun enthusiasts. \nThose rulings left no doubt that the court, with a six-justice super\nFifth Circuit Could Be a Standard-Bearer majority that had already upended abortion rights and affirmative action, is the most ideologically conservative Supreme Court since the early 1930s. Yet it is almost certainly not the most conservative federal court in the country. \n\nAbout 1,000 miles away, in New Orleans, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has turned its corner of the federal judiciary into a proving ground for some of the most aggressive conservative arguments in American law. Six of the 17 judges were nominated by former president Donald J. Trump, who has vowed to continue transforming the federal judiciary with further nominations if elected again in November. \nContinued on Page A13 \n\n# \nThreat to Affordable Homes Developers of subsidized housing, who cannot raise rents or charge more for starter homes, say insurance costs are derailing their efforts.
