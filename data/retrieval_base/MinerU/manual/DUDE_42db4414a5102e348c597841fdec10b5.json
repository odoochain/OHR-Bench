        "text": "$\\textcircled{\\scriptsize{\\circ}}$ Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Farm Designs are especially developed (1) to   \nmeet today's farming needs; (2) for proper and profitable housing of livestock; (3) to provide structural stability and exceptional durability; and (4) to take maximum advantage of the fact that lumber produced in Weyerhaeuser sawmills is manufactured in uniform lengths and sizes, with ends and edges already squared, which eliminates needless sawing, fitting, and material waste. In   \nplanning any new farm building, you'll find a Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Farm Design gives you unmatched advantages in design,durability,adaptability, economy and simplicity of construction- as well as in appearance. \n# \n# \n# \nNo matter how efficient and mechanized farm operations become, the true farmer who loveshis land and his work will never look at farming as aâ€œmass production factory'.Here in this book are Weyerhaeuser Farm Designs for the kind of buildings and equipment fromgreenhousestobridges-thatkeepfarming a way of life rather than just a job. There are many workshop plans ... many handy househoid items that help lighten the farm wife's work . . . post-free buildings in various sizes to house special projects or hobbies.

They are structurally sound,able to withstand severe storms ...and they are easily adapted to a wide variety of uses so that your investment in them is well protected.
