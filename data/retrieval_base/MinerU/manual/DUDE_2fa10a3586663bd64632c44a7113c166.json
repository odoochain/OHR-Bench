This procedure applies to both L.H.and R.H.Assemblies. \nSlide Top Hitch Bar Assembly (311.015) into Top Hitch Bracket with lugs uppermost and with hole required in forward position, leaving setscrews slack. Distance between shoulders of Category 1 (small) hitch pins should be approximately 30in., depending on Tine spacing required. Recommended Tine spacing for Models AS-A and AS-B is 12in. \nHaving spaced Tines and Top Hitch Bracket to suit, tighten Top Hitch Bracket, Lower Hitch Bracket, and Arm Assembly bolts. \nPosition Top Hitch Bar Assembly with Top Hitch Lugs spaced centrally between Top Hitch Bracket Assemblies for normal working.

        "text": "# \nEssentially simple to operate,the Toolbar Cultivator has several features withwhich the ownershouldbeconversant. \n# \nPatented clamps forming part of the Lower and Upper Hitch Bracket Assembliesmay be slackened off and moved to a limited extent in or out from the normal position (see assembly instructions) to allow for particular tine spacingwhen cultivatingrowcrops. \nThe main bar may also be offset to one side for orchard cultivation or similarwork. \n# \nWhen cultivating row crops it is possible to raise the front tines in their clamps by means of the series of holes in the upper part of the tine. This enables close cultivation without danger to roots whilst the rear tines are allowedtopenetratedeeper. \nThe fixed tines are designed with a shear bolt to protect the tine in the eventofstriking an obstruction. \n# \nHere, again, the tines can be spaced as required.The pre-loading of the springs is accomplished by positioning of the nut and locknut behind the spring pressure collar on both front and rear tines. \nThe pitch of the tines may be set individually by positioning the fully screwed clamp bolt against the head of which the tine upper end is held by the pressure of the spring. The penetrating ability of partly worn points can be improved by increasing the pitch in this manner. \nWhen repositioning the tines on the bar it is necessary to slacken the pressure on the springs. \nOn all tines the point is secured by one bolt and a tongue which is held by the tine strap. These straps are rivetted, and may be replaced when worn. \nA full range of tine points is illustrated at the back of this book. \n# \nTyre pressures (where depth wheels are fitted) should be maintained at approximately 45 1bs.sq. in. This is, of course, dependent upon conditions, since the object of the pneumatic tyres is to utilise their flexibility to prevent soil adherence. Using the above figure as a basis, practice will dictate the correcttyrepressure. \nDepth wheel should be lubricated twice daily when in use. Whenreplacing felt seals, provided for grease retention, it is advisable to soak the new seals in oil for ease of fitting. \nOn the stump jump tine a lubrication point is provided on the Inner Spring Pressure Collar.This point should be greased once daily. \nThe threaded section of the Spring Pressure Rod should be frequently given a protective coating of grease."
