        "text": "$\\textcircled{\\scriptsize{\\circ}}$ Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Farm Designs are especially developed (1) to   \nmeet today's farming needs; (2) for proper and profitable housing of livestock; (3) to provide structural stability and exceptional durability; and (4) to take maximum advantage of the fact that lumber produced in Weyerhaeuser sawmills is manufactured in uniform lengths and sizes, with ends and edges already squared, which eliminates needless sawing,fitting, and material waste.In   \nplanning any new farm building,you'll find a Weyerhaeuser4SquareFarmDesign gives you unmatched advantages in design,durability,adaptability, economy and simplicity of construction- as well as in appearance. \n# \n# \nBoth the portable and colony type hog houses included in this book have been engineered for tight,weatherproof construction to assure the warmth,dryness,sunlight,and ventilation baby pigs require. In the larger houses,interior space is held down to preserve animal heat without sacrificing head room or foor area. There is ample light,yet windows are kept to a minimum to reduce heat loss.All the houses are designed to fit in well with existing farm buildings and to give the same advantages in durability and easy maintenance common to all lumber buildings onthefarm. \nThe portable houses, designed for use with the popular Clean Range Sanitary System, include sectional floorpanels that can be removed and cleaned easily. There are many instances where soil drainage and ground conditions make this added feature desirable.If you choose a colony house,you should include a tightly fenced, easily cleaned concrete feeding and exercise platform. With the colony house, the sow and her litter can be moved to clean pasture if you provide range shelters. Or you can remove the sows at weaning time and confine the pigs to the house. \nYou'llfind Weyerhaeuser-designed Hog Houses and equipment items ease chores and save time, whether hogs are a sideline or major part of yourfarm operation. \n$\\textcircled{\\scriptsize{\\Theta}}$ Plans, specifications, and material lists for these and many other farm buildings available at your lumber dealer. \n# \n# \nPlanNo. TITLE Page   \n1302-a A-Type 1-Pen Hog House.. 4   \n1303-d 4-Pen U.M.U.TwoSection Hog House. 4   \n1303-f 6-Pen U.M.U.TwoSection Hog House. 4   \n1376 Growing and Finishing House 4   \n1308-d-1 Arched Roof 4-Pen Hog House(with floor). 4   \n1308-d-2 Arched Roof 4-Pen Hog House(without floor) 4   \n1311-b 2-Pen Shed Roof Hog House 5   \n1311-c 3-Pen Shed Roof Hog House. 5   \n1312-d Gambrel Roof 4-Pen Hog House 5   \n1313-a 1-PenModifiedGable Hog House 5   \n1313-b 2-PenModifiedGable Hog House 5   \n1313-c 3-PenModifiedGable Hog House 5   \n1314-a Modified A-Type1-Pen Hog House 5   \n1314-b ModifiedA-Type2-PenHog House 5   \n1375 12StallFarrowing and Nursery Unit 6   \n1371 Rigid Frame Colony Hog House.. 6   \n1372 Storage Loff Colony Hog House 6   \n1373 Farrowing-Growing House..   \n1374 Pig Shelter. 7 \n# \nPlatform HogFeeder-30Bushel OpenTrough HogFeeder 30Bushel Closed Trough HogFeeder-—Hog Range Shelter 100Bushel ClosedTrough Hog Feeder-—Farrowing Crate,etc.   \nIllustrationsandDescriptions 8-9   \nDrawings... 10-17   \nEquipmentMaterial Lists 18-19 \n# \nYour local Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Lumber Dealer will be glad to go over blueprints and material lists with you,answer any auestions you may have,and helpyou plan abuilding program that will fit in with your farm operation."
