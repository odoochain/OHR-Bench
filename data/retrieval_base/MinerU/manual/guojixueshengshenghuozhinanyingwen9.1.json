If passport has been renewed after application, be prepared to show both the old and new passport upon registration at Tsinghua. It is recommended to bring 8 recently taken passport-style photos (2 inches, with a white background), which may be required for school administrative formalities. \n4. Students under 18 years old should provide a “China Guardian Certificate” (to be obtained once in China). Chinese name: 在华监护人公证书 . \n5. Highest diploma and degree certificate (original copy) \n6. Foreigner Physical Examination Form.

        "text": "# \nAccording to Chinese law, it is not possible to apply for a visa or change visas by entering Mainland China using a visa-free entry. Do not use a visa-free entry to enter into China. \n1. For students applying for a visa from outside of China, please carefully research visa types, and read the description below: \na. X1 Visa: The X1 visa generally permits only one entry, and students must register at the university within 30 days after entry in order to apply for the required residence permit, otherwise it constitutes illegal residence. Since the university does not accept students registering in advance of the scheduled date, and it usually takes 3-5 working days to prepare the residence permit application, it is suggested that international students holding an X1 visa should have at least one week remaining on their visa before its expiry date at the time of registration at the university. \nb. X2 Visa: The number of entries and the duration of stay permitted per entry are both indicated on the X2 visa. Once international students on an X2 visa enter the country, they should keep in mind the permitted duration of their stay on their visa and must register at the university within the time limit specified. \n\\* Please note that entry into Mainland China from Hong Kong S.A.R., Macao S.A.R., or China Taiwan is considered as one entry. \n2. Regarding visa collection: When picking up one’s passport containing the visa for China, please ensure that the Embassy or Consulate returns the original copy of the Admission Notice and the Visa Application for Study in China (JW202/201 Form). These are important and required documents for international students for their study, residence permit application and other procedures whilst in China. \n# \n1. The nationality of the passport used by the international student when registering at the university should be consistent with the nationality listed when applying to study at the university, otherwise they will not be able to register. \n2. For international students who have both foreign nationality and a residence identity from Hong Kong, Macao or China Taiwan, if they applied to the university under their foreign nationality they must not register at the university using travel documents for Hong Kong, Macao and China Taiwan (such as the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents and the Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents). \n\n# \nThe university arranges specific registration dates for all international students to register at the university. Advance registration is not available. International students whose visa, stay permit or residence permit has expired or will expire in too short a time to go through the registration formalities will not be permitted to register at the university. Therefore, travel planning is essential. Please do not enter into China too early in advance before the designated university registration period to avoid the risk of the entry visa expiring before registration, which will lead to an inability to register at the university or other difficulties. \n\nIn addition, after registration, international students applying for a residence permit will be without their passport for approximately 3-4 weeks while it is being processed. International students holding an X2 visa, who after registration need to apply for an extension or increase of the number of entries on their visa, will be without their passport for approximately 3-4 weeks."

        "text": "# \nIf an international student decides to renounce their admission offer from the university, he or she can not use the documents issued by the university to apply for a visa, nor use that visa to enter China. According to Chinese government regulations, after the university registration period has concluded, the university will report all unregistered international students to the Division of Exit and Entry Administration of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. \nIf a student holds a visa to study in China but does not register at the university they have been admitted to, the visa may be cancelled and the individual will be penalized for making an illegal stay. \n# \nIt is illegal to stay in China after a visa, stay permit or residence permit has expired. Those committing such an offense will be subject to a fine of 500 RMB per day and will face detainment or deportation. \n\n# \nAll international students must submit the completed Foreigner Physical Examination Form. Below are the two options for how the physical examination can be completed. \n# \nThe Foreigner Physical Examination Form is included in the admission package that will be sent to students in the mail prior to arrival at the university. The student can take the form to a hospital or clinic in their home country. The form should be written, signed and stamped by the doctor conducting the examination. The original form must then be brought to China (including the original blood test reports) and presented at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center - Haidian branch for authentication. The student will then receive a Physical Examination Report after authentication is approved. If the health documents provided do not meet the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center’s standards, the student must redo the health examination at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center. \n# \nAfter arriving in China, students can undergo the physical examination at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare Center - Haidian branch to obtain the Physical Examination Report. More information can be found by referring to the Physical Examination Authentication section, on page 12 of this Guide. \n\n# \n# \nIn China, only banks are authorized to provide legal exchange services of foreign currencies. Before trying to exchange foreign currency, check with bank service personnel whether the bank is able to provide the exchange service for the required foreign currency. Sometimes it is necessary to make an appointment in advance (usually one working day in advance). NonChinese citizens can exchange no more than 500 US dollars of foreign currency per day (for specific information, please consult the bank). Therefore, planning ahead is essential if a large amount of foreign currency is to be exchanged. \nA valid passport is required to be presented at the bank when exchanging foreign currency. Be mindful that the exchange rate of different banks is different, and that the exchange rate fluctuates in real time throughout the day. \n# \nAs banks require several days to complete a wire transfer, it is recommended that students bring a sufficient amount of cash with them to China to pay for the first month's living expenses. \n# \nBanks impose a daily withdrawal limit on credit and debit cards. Students should confirm the daily limit of their personal credit card/debit card within China with their bank before departure."

Refer to the Climate section on page 29 of this Guide for more details. For shoes, running shoes and sandals should be brought. \nIt is recommended that students bring often-used personal health and sanitary items such as cold and flu and stomach medicine, face towel, pillowcase, low power hair dryer and basic toiletries. \nBring any personal study items such as a laptop computer, and an electronic translation dictionary. Pens and other items can be bought at supermarkets on-campus. \nPower plug adaptors: Bring both the three-prong type and two-prong type adaptors (Chinese power voltage is 220V). \n\n# \nDue to the limited amount of accommodation available on campus, students should reserve a dormitory in advance. For more information, please refer to the Instructions for Tsinghua University International Students Dormitory Room Booking Application System (included in the admission package). For those who could not reserve accommodation on-campus, they will need to make their own housing arrangements off campus. Students who will receive the Chinese Government Scholarship (full scholarship), or students who have been selected to live in the Asian Youth Center will automatically be reserved a room, and therefore do not need to reserve a room themselves. \n# \nThe Tsinghua University International Student Apartments are the Zijing Apartment Buildings 19-23, and the Asian Youth Exchange Center (Building 6). There are three different room arrangements: double rooms, single rooms and “AB” rooms (with separate bedrooms and a shared bathroom). Double rooms are 40 RMB per day and the single and “AB” rooms are 80 RMB per day. \nThe dormitories are each equipped with a desk, bed and closet. A mattress, quilt, pillow and bed linen are also provided. There are specific times for the use of hot water for showering in the dormitories, which are as follows: 7:00am - 2:00pm and 5:00pm - 12:00am each day. Each year, the air conditioning system for the buildings is turned on between June $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and September $30^{\\mathrm{th}}$ , and the heating system is turned on between November $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and March $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ . Each building has its own public spaces for use by students, such as a study lounge, workshop space, multi-purpose room, light sports space (facilities vary from building to building). Also, apart from the AB rooms in building 20 that have a small room kitchen, all buildings have communal kitchens. Students need to use their own cooking utensils and supplies. All buildings are equipped with public washing machines, and some buildings also have dryers. \n\nAccording to school regulations, the Zijing Apartment Buildings 19-23 are for international students. Friends or family members are allowed to visit, but they must first register at the reception desk on the ground floor of the building after presenting their valid ID document. Guests are not permitted to stay overnight, and can visit between the hours of 8:00am and $11{:}00\\mathsf{p m}$ . \nStudents residing in the dormitories must abide by the dormitory rules and regulations stipulated in the Tsinghua University Administrative Measures for International Student Dormitory Accommodation. The measures include that that smoking indoors and the use of cooking appliances in areas other than the common kitchens are prohibited in the apartment buildings, and that the following objects are prohibited for being used or stored in the apartments: electric vehicle batteries and chargers (including scooter batteries), immersion heaters, electric blankets, electric water heaters, electric heaters or open flames such as candles. In the event of illegal residence in the apartment, the charging of electric vehicle batteries, non-residents staying in the apartment overnight, or the use of prohibited electrical appliances of the causing of a fire, the student’s right to accommodation will be forfeit. \n# \nDue to the limited amount of on-campus accommodation, some students will need to find accommodation off campus. Students who do not have a dormitory room reserved on campus can choose to rent an apartment off campus. Before moving in to any off-campus accommodation, it should be checked whether the landlord can provide the documentation required for the issuing of a Registration Form of Temporary Residence ( 临时 住宿登记表 ). \nThere are many housing agencies located near the Tsinghua campus. Their services and prices offered should be compared in advance. Below are some factors to be aware of when looking for off-campus accommodation: \n1. Choose a legal, reputable housing agency. Research online or through the State Administration for Industry and Commerce ( 中国工商行政管理机关 ) for the credentials and qualifications of housing agents and inquire with friends or others about their experiences using housing agents in the area."

Check and verify the landlord’s credentials and property credentials, including whether the property has the right to be rented out. If signing a lease through a third-party agent, check the agency agreement and understand the agency’s terms and conditions and their right to sign the contract. \n4. Carefully read through the conditions outlined in the rental contract and check whether the rights and obligations of the two parties are fair. Take note of whether the responsibility for a specific breach of contract is clearly defined and ensure that all commitments are written and signed off by the agent in the contract, not simply conveyed by spoken word. \n5. Pay attention and check through the information provided in receipts given, including the deposit amount and rental fee, and keep safe official documents and payment receipts.

Also, students are not permitted to apply for a motorized vehicle pass in campus. Motorized vehicles are forbidden from entering the student dormitory areas. The university does not recommend students to purchase electric vehicles (including scooters). \nThe primary mode of on-campus transportation is by bicycle (either personal bicycles or shared bikes). Bicycles should be locked after use. When walking or cycling on campus, please use the pavement or lanes for non-motorized vehicles. Do not ride in a dangerous manner, such as riding the wrong way down a roadway, speeding, or turning without signaling. \n# \nAvoid strenuous exercise and stay hydrated. Rest when feeling tired, hungry or uncomfortable.   \nWhen exercising, dress according to the season and time of day.   \nThose with illnesses should choose exercise methods that suit their physical condition.   \nTo avoid injury, do warm-up exercises beforehand and recovery exercises afterwards. Choose suitable exercise equipment.   \nIf one is injured during exercise, stop exercising and rest sufficiently. Recovery exercises should be performed until the injury heals. If necessary, see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. \n# \nDo not leave large amounts of cash; student IC card;  keys or other important and valuable objects out in one’s room. Either keep them safely locked away or on one’s person. \nObey dormitory regulations. When leaving the student dormitory room or resting inside the dormitory, lock the windows and door and do not let others stay in the room. When entering a dormitory building, make sure that others do not sneak in behind. Take an active role to prevent the subleasing of dormitory rooms by reporting such situations to the building staff or security staff. \nBe careful when using electricity inside the dormitory. The connecting, disconnecting, or pulling of electrical wires without permission is strictly forbidden. It is also forbidden to use electrical devices that go against regulations, as well as open flames such as candles or mosquito-repellant incense. Smoking in the dormitories is forbidden. Take care to prevent any potential fires from occurring. Become familiar with dormitory emergency exits and evacuation routes. When there is a fire, promptly raise the alarm and exit the building. \n# \nWhen choosing a specific online shopping website, first compare information such as volume of trade and customer reviews.

Apart from Wudaokou, there is also a nearby area called Liudaokou ( 六道口 ), where many students also choose to live. It has its own subway station of the same name on line 15, the Golden Towers shopping market, and a large variety of Chinese restaurants. \n\n# \n# \nBeijing has a rich cultural history, the reason for which many visitors come to the city.
