Physical force is force that is not likely to result in death or serious physica! injury. Generally this would mean an attack with empty hands or no weapons involved. \n2.  The private citizen or armed private security officer could respond by using reasonable force such as defensive tactics controls, a chemical weapon like CapStun TM, an electronic weapon or stun gun, or a baton. \n3.  Physical force is also reasonable if it is the minimum degree of force necessary to cause the threat to stop the attack or be placed under physical control. \n# \nORs 161.219(3) states that a person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person unless the person reasonably believes that the other person is using or about to use deadly physical force against a person."

It is also helpful in avoiding becoming the aggressor. \nThe Determination of Force Matrix is often expressed as a chart that shows the level of resistance by the threat, from low to high, and the corresponding level of appropriate force or action by the officer. At the lowest level of resistance the threat may refuse to comply or offer verbal resistance. The officer would reasonably respond by calmly talking to the threat, getting information, asking the threat to comply, providing choices, and calling for assistance. \nMaybe the threat resists by punching, kicking or attempting to escape. The officer could reasonably defend him or herself by using non-lethal techniques: restraining techniques, pepper spray or impact weapons. If the threat's resistance is lethal (uses a firearm or other lethal weapon like a knife or club, uses a non-lethal weapon or any object in a lethal manner, or attempts to disarm the officer), then the officer could reasonably respond with deadly force. \nThe Matrix also allows downward movement. As the officer gains control and/or compliance and the threat reduces or stops using force, then the officer's level of force is reduced to a level appropriate to maintain control over the threat. \nAlways keep in mind that your primary goal in a violent or potentially violent situation is to defend yourself or other persons from the threat"

You should not try to equally match your force to the threat's resistance. You should use just enough greater force than the threat, but not deadly force. \nExample: You confront a recently fired employee in your client's place of business. You ask this person to leave, but he refuses. You call for police assistance, and you continue to talk and attempt to gain compliance. After you have talked to this person for several minutes, he finally complies and leaves the premises. \nYou have responded to this person's low level of resistance with a correspondingly low response on the Matrix: being present in uniform, asking for compliance, giving direction, and getting help on the way. \nExample: Now let's take the same situation, but when you initially confront this person, he attacks you with punches and kicks. It is not possible to respond effectively with presence and verbal requests. You should immediately move to an appropriately higher level of force. You respond with force greater than his, but less than deadly force. Such force may include (but is not limited to) pepper spray, defensive tactics control techniques or impact weapons. \nIf he stops the attack and backs away, you would properly reduce your force to a level that allows you to maintain control or keep the threat away from you. For instance, if you opted to use pepper spray, you would stop spraying, but you would be ready to use it again if the threat resumed his attack. \nExample: Let's look at this same situation again. In this case you confront the person, but before you can say anything, he draws a handgun from under his jacket and points it at you. It would be reasonable for you to believe that you are in immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. Your response is to move immediately to deadly force on the Matrix. You would not be required to attempt to stop his attack at a lower level on the Matrix. \n# \nIt is a criminal act to use physical force or deadly physical force without justification.

The student will understand that legally and morally justifiable shooting decisions require that the armed private security professional devote prior thought, study and decision-making practice. \n# \nMost everyday job-related decisions, both great and small, are made by understanding your private security mission, obtaining information, reviewing past experience, comparing options and alternatives, and then using this input to choose a course of action. The process for making use of deadly force decisions is similar, but the stakes are much higher. \n# \nEffective protection of the client requires the armed private security officer to observe, report and coordinate assistance. The armed officer has no statutory duty to protect by direct intervention, and, in any case, that is not the reason why the officer is armed. The armed officer carries the gun because a threat may perceive the officer to stand between him and the threat's objectives (access to the site, theft, escape), and is willing to attack and kill the officer. Also, carrying out the responsibilities of observing and reporting may place the officer in harm's way. The gun is a deterrent to the threat, and a ready means of self defense. \n# \nBeyond knowing that you are dealing with a potentially dangerous person, the actual facts surrounding the encounter may be unclear or confusing. Most use of force incidents share this characteristic. You may not immediately realize that you are under attack. Your initial contact with the threat may seem routine and innocuous. Since weapons may not be readily visible or may be purposely concealed, the threat may be difficult to identify as a dangerous person.

You need to see that the person is actually a deadly threat. \nTo help you identify a person as a deadly threat, you must ask and answer these questions: \n1. Is the threat armed?   \n2.

However, some people have the strength or ability to injure you with their hands and feet. Multiple unarmed attackers may be able to overwhelm your defense and seriously injure or kill you. You must realistically assess your physical ability to defend against a larger, better trained (martial arts) or younger opponent. \n# \nIs this person in a location, position or at a distance that will permit him to harm you or another person? A man armed with a knife is not an imminent threat when he is 1o0 yards away, but if he approaches within twenty feet, he will be able fo attack and kill you within two seconds. At 100 yards this man does not have the opportunity to harm even though he has the means (the knife). At twenty feet he does have the opportunity because he could carry out an attack before you could respond. A person armed with a firearm may be a deadly threat at a great distance. He would not need to get close to cause you serious physical injury or death. \n# \nThis means that this person's actions are directed at you or another in such a way that leads you to believe that the person may inflict serious physical injury or death. For instance, a man, walking toward you carrying a shotgun, has a weapon (MEANS), is within 20 yards and can see you (OPPORTUNITY). However, unless he points the shotgun at you, and unless you reasonably believe that he intends to do you harm (i.e. threatens to kill you), INTENT does not exist. Assessing the totality of circumstances will help you determine if INTENT exists. Let's say that you are on duty at a plant, and you observe an employee take a shotgun from the trunk of his car. The employee may be simply transferring it to a friend's car for an after-work trip to the range. Or, he may be heading into the plant to seek revenge for losing his job. You must evaluate the totality of all the circumstances and actions, as well as the employee's demeanor and response to your questions or commands. All of these factors will help you determine if this person intends to place you or another in jeopardy. \n# \nIn addition to MEANS, OPPORTUNITY and INTENT the decision to use force is influenced by one or more factors that a reasonable person must consider. Every use of force situation is different, and these influencing factors will vary from one incident to another. Factors can combine to place you in a disadvantageous position that may require increased force. Other factors may indicate the use of lesser force or taking alternative action if circumstances are weighted in your favor (e.g. a small sixty year old woman punches a fit, thirty year old officer)."
