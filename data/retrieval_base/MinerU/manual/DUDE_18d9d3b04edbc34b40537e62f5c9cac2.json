Note any internal defects. \n3.3.1 Measure the aircll height by means of aircell gauge while candling prior to breaking. \n3.4 Shell Thickness —- After breaking the egg, boil the shell in 2·5 percent sodium hydroxide solution for 5 minutes. Wash and dry in a thermostat1- cally controlledoven at 100 to $105^{\\circ}C$ for 24 hours. Determine the thickness of the shell by screw gauge at three different logitudinal points and take the average of the readings. \n3.5 Haugh Unit ( HU ) -- Haugh unit can be measured by using the interior egg quality calculator. The following precautions should be followed while estimating the sane: \ni) The internal tcmperature of eggs should not be lower than ${\\bf7^{\\circ}C}$ or higher than $15\\%$ at the time of performing the breakout test.   \nli) Care should be exercised to see that the thick white is not punctured whtle breaking.   \nii) One egg at a time should be broken since it is important to measure the albumen height immediately after breaking.   \niv) Measureiment of height of thick albumen should be made with the help of a spherometer or $\\mathbf{H}$ tugh meter or micrometer as given in Fig. 1.   \nv) Care should be taken to avoid measuring the albumen height in an area where there is a chalaza for air bubble. \n3.5.1 Eggs removed from the refrigerator should be kept for three hours at ambient temperature of $23^{\\circ}+2^{\\circ}\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}$ .Determine the Haugh unit reading of the eggs by the following procedure: \na) Check the zero reading by placing the instrument on a fat surface and lowering the plung until the point touches the surface. The pointer should be at zero.  If not, slacken the clamp and turn the bezol so that the zero mark coincides with the pointer. Retract the point upwards to its full extent.   \nb) Open the egg on to a flat glass plate of suficient size to contain It, place the instrument over the egg, and lower the point until just touches the albumen The height is then indicated on the dial."
