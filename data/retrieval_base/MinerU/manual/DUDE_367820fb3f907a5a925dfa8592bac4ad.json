Up to 99 positions can be indexed on one video cassette tape.The INDEX SELECT Buttons searches the desired recording start point and start playbackimmediately. \n# \nThis button searches any blank (unrecorded part of the tape extending for 14 seconds in the fast forward mode, about 3 minutes in the SP mode, or about 9 minutes in the SLP mode) during recording or playback. The tape is then broughtto the start of theblankportion. \n# \nWhen this button is pushed during recording and normal playback, the numerals on the Tape Counter disappear and the remaining tape time is indicated. \n# \nThe unit eliminates the editing problem common to previous VCRs. When the Pause/Still Button is pushed during recording, the tape will automatically rewind a little. This reduces to a minimum any interference caused by pauses during recording. \n# \nTwo audio tracks permit recording from two microphones, preamplified stereo phonograph, etc. for playback in stereo sound, or for bilingual source material. \n# \nA camera with a power consumption of less than 8.8 W can directlybe connected this terminal. \n# \nThis VCR can be operated with Dolby NR. Dolby NR is a noise reduction system which greatly suppresses background noise in the audio signal caused by the tape. Dolby NR circuitry enables you to retain a good sound quality. \n\\*'Dolby' and the double-D symbol are trademarks of Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation."

There areotherVHSunits availablewhichoperateon2-hour,4-hour (LP) and 6-hourformats. The unit cannot record LP recording.   \nOlf the VCR is suddenly moved from a cold place to a warm place, moisture that can cause damage to both the tape and the unit may form inside the unit. Avoid such changes in temperature, if possible. When excessive moisture is present within the VCR, the Dew Indicator Lamp will light up and the VCR will not operate to prevent damage to the tape or the video recording mechanism.   \nODo not block or cover the ventilation slots on the top, back and bottom of the unit. Especially avoid soft materials such as cloth orpaper.   \n●Use the unit in a horizontal position and do not place anything heavy on it.   \n●Take special care not to use or store the unit for a long period of time in direct sunlight, in excessively hot, cold, damp or dusty places, or places subject to heavy vibrations.   \n●Do not insert fingers or any other objects into the cassette holder. \n# \nThe video heads of your Panasonic video recorder are extremely sensitive. Although hardly ever necessary, in the event video head cleaning must be performed, it is recommended that the cleaning be done by a qualified technician. The need for video head cleaning is indicated if playback of a known good tape results in a very snowy picture but with good sound. ●Avoid operating or storing the unit and video cassettes near appliances generating strong magnetic fields (large motors, power transformers, or large audio speakers). OKeep the unit away from flower vases, tubs, sinks, etc. CAUTION: If liquids should be spilled into the unit, serious damage will be caused. If you spill any liquid into the unit consult qualified service personnel. ●Do not spray any cleaner or wax directly on the unit or use forced airtoremove dust. ODo not attempt to disassemble the unit. There are no user serviceablepartsinside. Refer to qualified service personnel for any technical problems.

Up to 99 positions can be indexed on one video cassette tape. These buttons search the desired recording start points and start playback automatically. \nAutomatic search with the INDEX SELECT Buttons is possible if the recording time is 2 or more minutes. Search operations can be performed more conveniently if numbers are jotted down along with the titles of the recordings on the video cassette in accordance with the recording sequence as an index. Then positions on the tape can be searched using the INDEX SELECT Buttons."
