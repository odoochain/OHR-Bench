Each course is worth 6 ECTS credits. \nSign up today! \n\n# \nWhat does it mean to know things by numbers? Do management tools describe or construct organizations? This course explores how calculative practices help managers ‘know’ their organizations and how and why it is that management technologies make organizations, activities, and people available for managerial intervention. \n# \nThe aim of this course is to provide students with intellectual and practical tools necessary for a critical knowledge and understanding of gender issues whilst working in organizations and in selfemployment in both developed and developing country contexts. It will also discuss theories of gender differences and strategies for workplace gender equality. \n# \nThe pursuit of the singular goal of shareholder wealth maximization has many interconnected sides. This advanced undergraduate course exposes the student to the essential principles of corporate financial decisionmaking that underpins the shareholder wealth maximization maxim. \n# \nThis course is centered around two often taken-for-granted concepts; communication and information. Special attention is given to differences in financial and non-financial information and numerical and nonnumerical communications."
