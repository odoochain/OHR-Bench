        "text": "# \n# \nNIST SRM 9983 High Rigidity Ball Bar Stand is designed to support a ball bar having $25.4~\\mathrm{mm}$ (one inch) diameter balls in various orientations during Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) performance evaluation. Ball bars with $25\\mathrm{mm}\\cdot$ $30~\\mathrm{mm}$ diameter balls will .work equally well. However, using ball bars with ball diameters larger than $30\\mathrm{mm}$ increases the instability of the ball bar during   CMM   measurements   and   is   not recommended for use with this stand. Do not use ball bars with ball diameters less than $25\\mathrm{mm}$ They will not sit properly in the kinematic mounts. \nSRM 9983 High Rigidity Ball Bar Stand will work with ball bar lengths ranging from $200\\mathrm{mm}$ to $1500~\\mathrm{mm}$ in the vertical, horizontal, and inclined  orientations.  For  ball  bars  in  the horizontal  orientation,  the  stand  is  limited   to supporting the ball bar from $115~\\mathrm{mm}$ (4.7 inches) to $1065\\mathrm{mm}$ (42 inches) above the table surface. \nThe stand is compatible with NIST SRM 2083 screw together type ball bars which are available through the NIST SRM program office. Additionally, the stand can be used with proposed SRMs 2501 - 2509 calibrated ball bars which are currently under development.  Other ball bars having the appropriate size ball may also be used. The calibrated ball bars are equipped with anti-roll collars situated at both ends of the ball bar which, when used with the High Rigidity Ball Bar Stand's capture collar, can help prevent the ball bar from falling from the stand in the event of an accidental collision. \nThe ANSVASME B89.1.12M  Methods for Performance Evaluation of Coordinate Measuring Machines recommended ball bar orientations can be achieved with this stand. See Appendix A for a complete description of the ball bar positions recommended by the standard. \n# \nThe stand should arrive in one case. Figure 1 contains the name and quantity of each item provided.   It is recommended that the user inventory all items before proceeding to the assembly section of this manual. \nFigure 1.

To assemble the stand, remove the bases from the stand case. The bases can be easily removed by inserting a M10 bolt into the center tapped hole. Using the bolt as a handle, gently pull the base from the case. \n# \n(1) The   bases  have  extremely  strong magnets mounted in them. Subsequently, they can clamp down on magnetic surfaces with sufficient force to cause injury. \n(2) Keep the bases away from magnetically sensitive items such as computer diskettes. \n# \nThe ball bar can be mounted in the horizontal position, as shown in Figure 2, by selecting the columns or combination of columns that best approximate the desired height.  The minimum height is formed by attaching the top mount directly to the base, resulting in the height of the ball center at approximately $115~\\mathrm{mm}$ above the table surface. (Appendix B provides a list of the heights of these components.)  For all higher horizontal orientations   various   column combinations will allow the ball bar to be positioned within $25\\mathrm{mm}$ (one inch) of the desired location, up to a maximum height of $1065~\\mathrm{mm}$ \nFigure 2.

Check to be sure the columns are securely attached together and to the base. The two stands should be separated by a distance that allows one ball of the ball bar to be located in the 3 ball top mount while the other ball is in the middle of the parallel cylinder top mount, centered over the magnet. If the ball is not within a few millimeters of this position, remove the ball bar and reposition the stand. Note: be sure that the parallel cylinders are aligned parallel to the ball bar axis as shown in Figure 2. \nFigure 5. Assembling a combination of columns \n\nFigure 6.

        "text": "Assemble the desired columns to the base, starting with the longest column segment first. Hand tighten this assembly firmly. Place the assembled structure on a flat surface in an erect position. Remove the three ring mount from the stand case. Orient the center hole in the ring mount over the column making sure the three ball mount is situated toward the top of the column (refer to Figure 10). Slide the ring mount over the erect assembly. If the ring mount does not easily slide over the column, remove the ring mount and check to ensure that the ratchet handle is disengaged. The ring mount should rest upon the base. Attach the parallel cylinder top mount to the column assembly. Align the top mount and ring mount such that the parallel cylinders located on the vertical face of the top mount are directly above the three ball ring mount. Secure both the top mount (using the ball driver) and the ring mount (using the ratchet lever -- note only a small amount of force on the ratchet lever is needed to secure the ring mount to the columns.) \nFor nonstandard ball bar lengths the height of the ring mount can be adjusted. In this case the ring mount will not rest upon the base. \nHolding the ball bar with both hands, gently place one ball of the ball bar into the three ball ring mount and the remaining ball into the parallel cylinder mount. The ball bar should be positioned vertically. If it is angled significantly to either side, remove the ball bar, reposition the ring mount and replace the ball bar as described above. \nIf a ball bar with anti roll collars is used, insert the capture collar into the two holes located on the vertical surface of the top mount as seen in Figure 10. \n# \nOnce the ball bar stand has been assembled, place it at the desired location on the CMM table. The magnets mounted in the bottom of each base provide holding force on magnetic surfaces, e.g., steel tables. The ball bar stand can be used on nonmagnetic surfaces. In this case, the stand can rest under its own weight. It is recommended that the user toe clamp the stand to nonmagnetic surfaces, when the probing forces are large $(\\geq50$ grams) or when the stand height is large $(\\geq700\\mathrm{mm})$ . The bases are robust and can be used as clamping surfaces if necessary. Additionally, there are threaded holes in the bottom of each base. If your CMM has threaded inserts at the correct spacing, these holes can be used to secure the bases directly to the table. \n\n# \nThe following section describes possible solutions to problems that may arise while using the ball bar stand  resulting in  unrepeatable   ball  bar measurements. \n(a) Make sure the mating surfaces of columns are not burred or dirty. \n(b) Make sure the magnets and feet located on the bottom of each base are free from debri. \n(C) Make sure the magnetic seats on the top mounts and ring mount where the ball bar seats are clean and free from debri. \n(d) Check to ensure the balls of the ball bar arerestingproperlyinthemountsandtheballs are not contacting the magnet.
