Submucous Myomectomy Transection of Intrauterine Adhesion Transection of Intrauterine Septa Endometrial Ablation etc. \n# \n# \nImproper use can lead to severe patient injuries and/or damage to the Endoscope. Due to the high energy from the   \nillumination fiber, the distal end of the   \nEndoscope may reach temperatures above $41^{\\circ}\\mathtt{C}$ $106^{\\circ}F)$ within a distance of $10\\mathsf{m m}$ . To avoid burns to the patient tissue, do not leave the tip of the Endoscope in direct contact. To prevent potential safety   \nthreads to the patient caused by a   \ndefective Endoscope, always have at least one additional Endoscope (sterile ） ready to be used for the current procedure.   \nIf High Frequency ( HF ） electro surgical instruments are used, keep the working element always within the field of view to prevent accidental burns. Always ensure a sufficient distance from the tip of the   \nEndoscope with conductive accessories before activating the HF output. Only   \nmedical electrical equipment which   \ncomplies with IEC 601-1 is allowed to be used with the Endoscope.   \nEndoscopes are fragile optomechanical devices which need to be handled with   \ncaution. To avoid damages caused from Laser burns it is necessary to keep the   \nLaser delivery fiber away from all parts of the Endoscope.   \nAlways hold the Endoscope at the housing   \nbody and/or eyepiece   \nDo not bend the tubing   \nAvoid shaking or dropping   \nStore and sterilize separate   \nUse protective polymer tubes (IEC  \nInnoView GMBH accessories 70-0018-00   \n) for storage and shipping \n\n# \n# \nThe Endoscope has to be checked before and after every use, whether the service performance is ok and the Endoscope has no damages. Furthermore check the light connector to make sure it is clean. Remove the Storz?, Wolf@ light adapter to assure proper cleaning if necessary ( see cleaning instructions ). \nSee our diagram for the correct choice of light adapters, which screw onto the light connector. \n3 Storz@/Olympus@ fitting 4 Wolf@/ Dyonics? fitting 5 ACMI@/Stryker? connector 6 Storz@-sheath lock 7 Eyepiece \n\n# \nCheck the Endoscope immediately after you receive it, as well as before and after each surgery.

        "text": "tubing and/or distal- and proximal end can be signs of damage to the Endoscope. \nTo ensure flawless performance, look through the Endoscope ( proximal end ) into the light while you rotate it clockwise.   \nAll surfaces should appear flat, shiny and without distortion. Moisture inside the Endoscope as well as damaged rod lenses cause a cloudy/hazy   \nimage or complete loss of the image. To ensure sufficient light coverage, connect the light fiber cable/light   \nsource to the light connector/adapter of the Endoscope.   \nThe light exiting the distal end has to be an evenly distributed ball of light without any dark areas. \n# \n# \nNever clean and sterilize Endoscopes together with other instruments unless they are individually secured in one container. \nIEC-InnoView GMBH Endoscopes must be cleaned with a PH-neutral cleaning solution which is recommended by the manufacturer for reprocessing of medical Endoscopes. Remove the light adapter and let the Endoscope soak inside the PH-neutral solution according to the manufacturers specifications. Ensure the thorough rinsing of the Endoscope and adapters to remove the cleaning solution. After the Endoscope and the adapter are dry, assemble both. \nEach Endoscope has three optical surfaces which constantly need to be checked and cleaned for optimum performance: \nDistal End Proximal Window Fiber Optic Light Connector \n# \n1. Use an Enzymatic Solution together with a gauze cloth to clean each of the above mentioned surfaces. Afterwards rinse the Endoscope thoroughly with distilled water. \n2. Repeat step one,but now use Isopropyl alcohol instead and rinse again with distilled water.   \n3. Repeat step one,but now use Acetone instead and rinse with distilled water.   \n4. Check each surface with reflective light for foreign particles and scratches, which could have a negative effect to the image quality. \n# \nUse theIEC-InnoViewGMBHwaterbased Mineral Fluid（Article # 10-0199-00） together with a Q-Tip to remove deposits from optical surfaces. Soak the end of the $\\mathsf{Q}$ -Tip with the Mineral Fluid, squeeze it slightly onto the optical surface and continue circular motions to remove the deposit. Afterwards rinse the surface with tap water and use a very soft brush to remove the Mineral fluid. \n# \nThis is NOT part of your routine cleaning. Use the water based Mineral Fluid only if the image is cloudy due to deposits on the optical surfaces. NEVER use UItrasonic Cleaners,because it will damage the optical system. The extreme steam temperatures caused during autoclaving will harden foreign particles on the optical surface which may lead to a decrease in image quality or a complete loss of the image. \n# \nIEC-InnoView GMBH Endoscopes must be sterilized in Sterilization-Containers, which are specifically designed for the purpose of sterilization. Each Endoscope is individually secured inside the container. It is not recommended to wrap Endoscopes in towels ( if the image quality is not sufficient ). Towels may leave residue on the optical surfaces. \n# \nEndoscopes NoT marked “autoclave” are not allowed to be used in temperatures above $60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ $(140^{\\circ}\\mathsf{F})$ . It can cause damage to the optical components and will ultimately lead to the expiration of your warranty. Please use chemical solutions which are designed specifically to sterilize instruments and devices ( always adhere to the manufacturers instructions ). \n# \nhttp://www.endoscopy.md/clientuploads/pdf/ST ERIS%20System%201%20%202-22- 10%20Letter.pdf \nInnoView GMBH Endoscopes can be placed in a disinfectant solution and must then be sterilized according to the manufacturers recommended sterilization process. InnoView GMBH Endoscopes comply with the SterisTM procedure. \n# \nOnly Endoscopes which are marked \"autoclave\"can be autoclaved!   \nBefore each Endoscope can be   \nautoclaved, make sure that all optical surfaces are without any foreign   \nparticles and the Endoscopes are   \nthoroughly cleaned. Lack of   \ncleanliness before autoclaving can result in severe damage to the   \nEndoscope.   \nCarefully secure the Endoscope   \ninside the Sterilizing-Container and make sure it does not touch any other metal objects   \n(instruments/container...)   \nRecommended steam sterilizing   \ncycle: $134^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ $(273^{\\circ}\\mathsf{F})$ I over a period of 5-8 minutes.   \nPlease keep the Sterilizing-Container closed until it has cooled to room   \ntemperature. NEVER immerse the Endoscope into cold water after it has been autoclaved. Rapid temperature change may damage the optical   \nsystem an will ultimately void the   \nwarranty. \n# \nNEVER immerse theEndoscope into cold water after it has been autoclaved. Rapid temperature change will damage the optical system and will ultimately void the warranty. \nPlease, use biological indicators on a regular basis to ensure compliant sterilization conditions. \n# \nAlways use the InnoView GMBH polymer tube protector ( if provided with the specific Endoscope ) for storing as well as the original shipping box ( including foam inserts ). Always make sure that Endoscopes are stored separately and secured from falling or touching other instruments. \n# \nIEC-InnoView GMBH offers a brand new Endoscope to it's dealers which will provide a drastic price reduction in exchange of the old damaged Endoscope to the hospital. \n# \nInnoView GMBH Endoscopes are CE approved P CE 0124 and have FDA approval P 510 (K) \n# \nInnoViewGMBH Endoscopes comewitha 2 year minimum warranty. Fluid invasion WITHOUT mechanical damage. NO warranty on shaver-cut Endoscopy distal tip, broken Rod Lenses and tubing due to mishandling, HF-burnt distal tip etc. \nRepairs and modifications performed by unauthorized professionals will lead to the expiration of the   \nwarranty. \n# \nU.S. Division ( Distribution ) \nINNOVATIVE ENDOSCOPY   \nCOMPONENTS,LLC   \n320 International Parkway   \nFort Lauderdale, Florida 33325   \nUSA   \nPhone: 954-217-8780   \nFax: 954-217-8781   \nE-mail: info@Endoscopy.MD   \nInternet: www.lECendoscopy.com"
