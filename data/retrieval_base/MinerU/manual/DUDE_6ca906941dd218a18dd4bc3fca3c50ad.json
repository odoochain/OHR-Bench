This standard is intended to assist in production of quality tiles. \nThe clay tiles used for farm drainage purpose are generally of two types : (a) tiles with open joints, and (b) perforated tiles with collar joints. This standard is issued in two parts, Part I covers tiles with open joints and  Part II covers requirements of perforated tiles with collar joints. \nThis standard was first published in the year 1978. This standard has been revised to incor. porate the requirements for the clay tiles joints \nFor the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with Is $2:1960$ \\*Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised )': The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard."
