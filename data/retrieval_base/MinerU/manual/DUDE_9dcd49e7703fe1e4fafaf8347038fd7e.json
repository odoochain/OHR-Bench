        "text": "$\\textcircled{6}$ Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Farm Designs are especially developed (1) to   \nmeet today’s farming needs;(2) for proper and profitable housing of livestock; (3) to provide structural stability and exceptional durability; and (4) to take maximum advantage of the fact that lumber produced in Weyerhaeuser sawmills is manufactured in uniform lengths and sizes, with ends and edges already squared, which eliminates needless sawing, fitting, and material waste. In   \nplanning any new farm building, you'll find a Weyerhaeuser 4-Square Farm Design gives you unmatched advantages in design, durability, adaptability, economy and simplicity of construction- as well as in appearance. \n# \n# \n# \n# \nWeyerhaeuser-designedMachine Sheds take into account the many ways these buildings can serve your needs,and are planned accordngly.First of all, they are carefully engineered so that interiors can be open and post-free without sacrificing the structural rigidity of the buildings. Every building features extra large doors so that access is never a problem. In addition to their primary job of protecting expensive farm equipment, these buildings provide a sheltered work space for servicing and maintenance. For this reason, provision is made for storage of small parts, lubricants, tools, and so on. With everything in one place,repair work can be done more quickly and easily. A variety of accessories have been designed to simplify your shop work. \nPlan No: Title: Page:   \n3202 Combination Garage and Shop... 4   \n3203 Pole-Type U.M.U.
