        "text": "FORD CAR AND TRUCK \nVEHICLE SHAKE CAUSED BY WATER IN TIRE AND WHEEL ASSEMBLY (A11 car linesand light trucks) \nSevere vehicle shake, encountered at vehicle speeds in excess of 40 mph. while traveling over uneven road surfaces may be caused by water in one or more of the wheel and tire assemblies. Water can enter tires stored outdoors and inadequately protected from the element. Water in tires may be difficult to detect even though there may be as much as a quart per tire. If the above road test conditions are encountered and the balancing results are inconsistent, suspect water. Under these conditions and prior to switching or exchanging tire and wheel assemblies the tire must be broken loose from the rim and the inside inspected for the presence of water. \nCIGAR LIGHTER AND EMERGENCY FLASHER DO NOT WORK DUE TO BLOWN FUSE (1969Ford and truck) \nInspect for an electrical short in the cigar lighter and emergency flashers circuit. If no short is evident, the problem may be caused by the lighter element metal retaining cup shortening to the socket by metal retaining bonds when the lighter is pushed fully into the socket tray. Check for this problem by installing a new fuse and checking lighter. You can check for this problem when installing a new fuse and checking lighter operation. If fuse blows when lighter is pushed into socket, the element should be replaced. \n# \nPart Number C7SZ-15054-A \nName \nElement Assembly Cigar Lighter (Cuno) \nFUSE LINK-CHARGING CIRCUIT (All 1969 cars except Thunderbird, all light trucks, and 1970 Maverick) \nThe fuse link is a short length of insulated wire integral with the engine compartment wire and harness. It is several wire gauges smaller than the circuit than it protects. Production fuse links are black. Service fuse links are green or black depending on usage. All fuse links have the words FUSE LINK printed on the insulation."

        "text": "A burned out link will generally have bare wire ends protruding from the insulation, or it may only have expanded or bubbled insulation with illegible identification. If it is hard to determine if the link is burned out. perform a continuity test (see main article). Do not puncture the fuse link insulation. Replace the fuse link by the procedure given if the link burnsout. \n# \nA。 Disconnect the battery ground cable.   \nB. Disconnect the fuse link from the battery stud of the starter relay. On the Bronco and Parcel Deliyery, disconnect the wires from the BAT terminal of the alternator. Refer to Figure l. C. On all vehicles except the Bronco and Parcel Delivery, use an ohmmeter or self-powered test light and check for continuity between the fuse link eyelet terminal and the BAT terminal on the alternator. \nOn those vehicles that have two wires connected to the fuse link eyelet, cut the additional wire from the eyelet before checking the fuse link continuity. Attach a new eyelet to the additional wire before connecting it back on the starter relay terminal. \nD. On the Bronco and Parcel Delivery vehicles, include an ohmmeter or a self-powered test light and check for continuity between points A. and B. Refer to Figure l.   \nE. A good fuse link will light the test light or show zero resistance on the ohmmeter.   \nF. Connect all wires and the battery cable if the fuse link is OK. \nFuse Link Replacement \nA. Procure the proper service fuse link for the vehicle being repaired. The two fuse links listed have an eyelet terminal for a 5/l6 inch stud on one end. When the terminal is not required, cut off the fuse link as close to the terminal as possible and strip approximately 3/8 inch off the insulation from the cut end. B. Disconnect the battery ground cable.   \nC. Disconnect the fuse link terminal at the starter relay (alternator for the Bronco and Parcel Delivery)."

Remove the complete fuse link at the splice(s) and, when applicable, remove the old terminal from the battery stud of starter motor relay of the 65 amp. alternator (Parcel Delivery). \nE. Cut out the original splice(s), then splice and solder the new fuse link with existing wires from the original splices. Wrap completely with vinyl electricians tape. Refer to Figure l for a fuse link terminating in a multiple connector on the Bronco and Parcel Delivery. \nOn those vehicles that have two wires connected to the fuse link eyelet, cut the fuse link from the eyelet and position the second wire with eyelet back on the starter relay terminal. \nF.

This loose connection may result in damage to the switch and wiring connector. The wiring connector should be replaced, as outlined below, on units that exhibit connector damage. \nA。 Disconnect battery.   \nB. Remove ignition switch and disconnect existing connector. C. Cut the wires at the ignition switch and discard the connector Refer to Figure 2.   \nNOTE: The pink and violet resistance wires should be cut as close to the connector as possible.   \nD. Strip 5/l6 inch off insulation from the main wiring end of the cut wires.   \nE. Refer to Figures 2 and 3 to determine proper color match for the appropriate vehicle line and securely crimp the wire into the proper butt connector of the new ignition feed wire assembly. F. Install new connector to ignition switch using care not to cock the connector during installation (cocking the connector may spread the new terminals).   \nG. Install ignition switch, connect battery, and check for proper operation of switch."
