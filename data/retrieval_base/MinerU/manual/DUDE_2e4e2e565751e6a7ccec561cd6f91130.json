This funding supports Interior Secretary Ken Salazar’s strategy to bolster the volume of timber offered for sale; support resource management planning; increase surveying for rare, uncommon, or endangered species; provide environmental analysis for landscapelevel timber sale projects; and facilitate joint development and implementation of a revised recovery plan for the northern spotted owl. \n# \n# \nDifficult choices were made during the formulation of the 2013 budget to support the initiatives and priorities described above. The President’s budget request will decrease grazing administration costs by $\\$15.8$ million. However, the impact of this decline will be mitigated by a new grazing administration fee of \\$1 per animal unit month that the BLM proposes to implement on a pilot basis, generating an estimated \\$6.5 million in 2013 to help the BLM in processing grazing permits. The budget proposal will reduce funding for the Alaska conveyance program by \\$12.4 million while the Department of the Interior looks for ways to further streamline and reduce costs in the program. Other proposals include: a \\$3.5 million reduction in the public domain forest management program; a $\\$2.5$ million decrease in the Youth in the Great Outdoors initiative; and a reduction of \\$2 million in the abandoned mine lands program. The budget request will also eliminate the construction appropriatio account with a proposed reduction of $\\$3.6$ million. \nTo advance Secretary Salazar’s wild horse and burro management strategy, the President’s proposed budget calls for a \\$2 million increase that will fund research and development of population-control methods. The goal is to slow the annual population growth rate for wild horses while decreasing the need to remove excess animals from overpopulated herds on western public rangelands. Fewer gathers will reduce off-the-range holding costs, which constitutes the single largest cost of the program. \n\n\n\n\n\"TheBureauofLandManagement is a vital andvaluable agency for boostingtourism,outdoor recreation,and visitation to America'spubliclands-allof whichpower newjobs and economicactivityincommunities across the country. \n-Interior Secretary Ken Salazar"

        "text": "# \nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) may best be described as a small agency with a big mission: to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of America’s public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Bureau administers more public land— over 245 million surface acres—than any other Federal agency in the United States. Most of this land is located in the 12 western states, including Alaska. The BLM also manages 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate throughout the nation. \ncreate jobs and enhance our nation’s economic growth. In FY 2010, the BLM contributed more than $\\$112$ billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 500,000 American jobs. The BLM is one of a handful of agencies that generates more revenue than it spends. In FY 2012, nearly $\\$5.7$ billion will be generated by activities on BLM-managed lands, including an estimated \\$5.1 billion from onshore oil and gas development, with about half of those revenues going to the states where the leasing occurred. \nIn accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the BLM manages public land resources for multiple uses, such as energy development, livestock grazing, recreation, and timber harvesting, while protecting a wide array of natural, cultural, and historical resources. Many of these resources are found within the BLM’s 27-million-acre National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The conservation system includes 16 national conservation areas, 221 wilderness areas, and 16 national monuments. \nPresident Obama’s proposed fiscal year (FY) 2013 budget will enable the BLM to \nThe public lands and resources administered by the BLM are one of America’s greatest assets. They benefit our nation as a whole, as well as local communities, both economically and environmentally. Communities throughout the West are supported and strengthened through activities, goods, and services associated with resources located on public lands. The BLM believes that the best management of these resources results from creativity, ingenuity, perseverance, the ability to learn and adapt, and the willingness to work together in cooperation and partnership. These qualities exemplify the American spirit. \n# \nWith a focus on sage-grouse conservation, outdoor recreation, renewable energy, and other key priorities, the President has requested \\$1.1 billion in appropriations for the BLM in FY 2013. The request represents an $\\$8.3$ million decrease from the FY 2012 enacted funding level for the BLM and its 10,365 full-time equivalent staff. \nThe 2013 President’s budget proposal reflects efforts by the administration and the Secretary of the Interior to maximize public benefits while recognizing the reality of funding constraints and the need to reduce the nation’s budget deficit. Under this cost-conscious proposal, the BLM can still meet the challenge of managing and protecting the nation’s public lands by focusing on the following priorities: \n\n\nThe President’s budget proposal requests a \\$15 million increase for the BLM to implement sage-grouse conservation measures to help prevent the future listing of this species for protection under the Endangered Species Act. In its March 2010 ruling that listing the species is “warranted but precluded,” the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said the BLM was not fully implementing the necessary measures to ensure species conservation. The BLM has been working closely with 10 western states as well as Federal, state, and local partners to amend multiple land-use plans. These changes will ensure short-term and long-term conservation and restoration measures for the greater sage-grouse and its habitat. The BLM strives to amend these plans in a way that protects the health of the land while also facilitating safe and responsible energy development and recreational opportunities that power our economy. This planning process was formally initiated in late 2011, and the additional funds requested in 2013 will enable the BLM to ramp up this process and take other actions to address the concerns of the FWS before a final decision on whether to list the sagegrouse is made in 2015. \n# \n\nThe 2013 budget request also includes increases for programs funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a vital component of the America’s Great Outdoors initiative. The 2013 budget proposal includes $\\$33.6$ million for Federal land acquisition, an increase of \\$11.2 million from FY 2012 funding. \nThe BLM plays a vital role in advancing the President’s conservation initiative to reconnect Americans to the outdoors. The 2013 budget includes proposed increases for recreation, cultural resources, and the NLCS. That funding will enable the BLM to expand and improve opportunities for recreation, education, and scientific activities. A \\$1.1 million increase in the cultural resources management program will allow the BLM to accelerate inventories and surveys to determine the presence of archaeological, paleontological, and historical resources; conduct more stabilization and protection projects; and expand interpretation and information sharing. A proposed \\$2.2 million increase in the recreation resources management program will allow the BLM to develop and implement more travel management plans and also strengthen management of national scenic and historic trails and national wild and scenic rivers. A \\$3 million increase for the NLCS will enable the BLM to strengthen law enforcement, enhance visitor safety and experiences, and expand interpretation programs and products for national monuments and national conservation areas. \n# \n\n# \nThe President’s 2013 budget request includes an increase of \\$7 million to further promote and facilitate the development of renewable energy on public lands. Of these funds, \\$1 million will be used to accelerate the identification of prime areas for utility-scale, renewable energy projects. Of the remaining funds, \\$4 million will support geothermal energy development, while \\$2 million in geothermal funds will be transferred from the oil and gas program to the renewable energy program. \nThe 2013 budget request will also provide the BLM with the necessary funds to facilitate timely access to and environmentally sound development of Federal oil and gas resources. In addition, the proposal will ensure that the Federal government is collecting its proper share of revenue from oil and gas production on public lands. A proposed \\$5 million increase will restore the BLM’s leasing and inspection capacity to the 2011 enacted level. \nThe 2013 budget request also proposes to expand and strengthen the BLM’s oil and gas inspection capabilities by imposing fees on industry. The fee schedule included in the budget will generate an estimated $\\$48$ million in collections, which will offset a proposed reduction of \\$38 million in appropriated funds, providing for a net increase of \\$10 million in funds available for this critical responsibility."
