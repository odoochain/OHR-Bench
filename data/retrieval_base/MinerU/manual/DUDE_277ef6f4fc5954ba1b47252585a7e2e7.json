This includes on public transport, in stores and on crowded sidewalks. • Children over 2 years of age should wear a face mask in public, too. Children under 2 years of age should NOT wear face coverings for safety reasons.   \n• Cloth face coverings should be made from fabric you can't see through when held up to the light. They must be cleaned before reusing.   \n• Disposable paper face masks should be used for one outing outside the home. They cannot be properly cleaned. • The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to continue social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from others),  even when wearing a face covering. \n# \n# \n• DO clean your hands with soap and water or if that’s not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, before putting on your face covering. • Make sure the face covering covers both your nose and mouth.   \n• DON'T wear your mask hanging under your nose or mouth or around your neck. You won't get the protection you need.   \n• DON'T wear the face covering on top of your head, or take it of and on repeatedly. Once it is in place, leave the covering in place until you are no longer in public.   \n• DO clean your hands with soap and water or if that’s not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, before taking of   \nyour face covering. • Remove your mask only touching the straps. • Discard the face covering if it is disposable. If you are reusing (cloth), place it in a paper bag or plastic bag for later.   \n• Wash your hands again.   \n• When cleaning a cloth face covering, DO put in the washer (preferably on the hot water setting). • Dry in dryer at high heat. When it is clean and dry, place in a clean paper or plastic bag for later use. If you live in a household with many people, you might want to label the bags with names so the face coverings are not mixed up."
