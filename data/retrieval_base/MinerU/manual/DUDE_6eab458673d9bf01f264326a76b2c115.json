        "text": "# \n# \n# \nThe Millennium Scholarship is a maximum $\\$10,000$ award paid on a per-credit hour basis, up to 15 credits each semester. Millennium Scholars at a NSHE community college will receive $\\$40$ per credit hour. Students at a NSHE state college will receive $\\$60$ per credit hour. Millennium Scholars at all other eligible institutions will receive $\\$80$ per enrolled credit hour. \n# \nThe Millennium Scholarship will NOT pay for remedial or graduate courses. NSHE defines remedial as any class with a course number less than 100. \n# \n# \nIf you are enrolled at two institutions and wish to receive funds at both institutions, you must submit a “Co-Enrollment Form” which can be found at nvggms.gov under “Forms and Documents”. A co-enrolled student must be enrolled in at least 12 credits between both institutions and may only be funded for a total of 15 credits. Credits taken at the host institution must meet degree requirements at student’s home institution. \n# \nNevada State College (702) 992-2150 financial aid www.nsc.edu \nYes, but only under certain circumstances. If you are receiving other financial aid, your institution may provide the remaining value of your Millennium Scholarship award in a residual check. These funds may be used for other educational purposes such as registration fees, required textbooks, and other costs related to attendance at your eligible institution. \nNo, you don’t have to notify our office that you are changing schools. However, please make sure you declare a major at your new institution and follow up with the financial aid office. \n# \nAny semester, in which you receive funding from the scholarship, you must always finish the term meeting all the minimum requirements. For example, if you are at a university and drop to 9 credits, you will lose your scholarship. At a community college, if you drop to 9 credits you are still meeting the minimum requirements for that institution, so you wouldn’t lose your scholarship. \nCollege of Southern Nevada (702) 651-4047 financial aid www.csn.edu \nGreat Basin College (775) 753-2399 financial aid www.gbcnv.edu \nRoseman University of Health Sciences (702) 968-2004 financial aid www.roseman.edu \nSierra Nevada College (775) 831-1314 financial aid www.sierranevada.edu \nTruckee Meadows Community   \nCollege   \n(775) 673-7072 financial aid   \nwww.tmcc.edu University of Nevada, Las Vegas   \n(702) 895-3424 financial aid www.unlv.edu \n\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno (775) 784-4666 financial aid www.unr.edu \nWestern Nevada College (775) 445-3264 financial aid www.wnc.edu \n# \n# \n# \n\nIf you want to know your MSID number \nUse the lookup tool at nvggms.gov \n\nIf you could not find your name in the lookup tool \nGive us a call at (702) 486-3383. \n: oo15 the Leaislature passed SB 128 wnticin mtudents. in 2uis, bor of credit hours required for certain studons toehe eliaible for the Millennium Scholarship To ho oliaible to receive funds, students husts bat To pelled gn at least nine semester credit hours at d community college.
