Outdoor bins up to capacity $7~\\mathrm{m^{3}}$ are generally_ preferred by farmers for such storage. With a view to helping the manufacturers to fabricate bins of required quality and performance and helping farmers in getting proper type of bins, this standard has been formuiated. \n0.3 It is recommended that the fat-bottom bins should be suitably mounted on prefabricated steel elevated base. The hopper-bottom bins should be mounted on brick masonry columns as given in Appendix A. \n0.4 The requirements contained in this standard are based on the survey carried out and designs developed by the Indian Grain Storage Institute, Hapur. Other types of bins will be taken up as and when developed by otherorganizations. \n0.5Forthepurposeof decidingwhetheraparticularrequirementofthis standard is compiied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordancewith $\\mathbf{IS}:2{\\cdot}1960^{*}$ .The number of significantplaces retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value inthisstandard. \n# \n1.1 This standard prescribes requirements for materials, dimensions, capacities and method of construction of circular galvanized plain steel outdoor bins for bulk storage of grains at farm level. This standard includes flat- and hopper-bottom bins."

The conical roof with a slope of $\\mathbf{25^{\\circ}}$ should be made by joining 12 roof panels and roof stiffeners. The bin should have an inlet either at the centre or at the side of the roof to facilitate filling of the bin and the inclined outlets be provided at the bottom of the bin at the foor level. In a small-capacity bin only one outlet should be provided while for large capacity structures two outlets diagonally located may be provided. The fat-bottom bins should be mounted on prefabricated steel elevated base is given in Appendix A. \n3.2 The outdoor hopper-bottom bin ( see Fig. 2 ) consists of a cylindrical body conical roof and self-emptying type hopper having the hopper angle eitherof $35^{\\circ}$ Or $45^{\\circ}$ as required for different foodgrains.  The hopper part of the bin carries one single outlet at the bottom which facilitates the emptying of the structure completely. The hopper bottom of the bin has an advantage over the fat-bottom bin as the former allows complete discharge of the grain while certain quantity of the grain is lcft over in the case of flat-bottom bin. The remaining grain from the fat-bottom bin is ultimately required to be reclaimed manually. The spout of the bin would be nearly $750~\\mathrm{mm}$ about the ground level to facilitate filling of the bags conveniently. The details of the construction of the foundation are given in Appendix A. \n# \n4.1 The capacities and dimensions of the flat-bottom and hopper-bottom bins shall be as given in Tables I and 2 respectively."
