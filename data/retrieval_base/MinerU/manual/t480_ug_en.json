Follow and retain all information included with your computer. The information in this document does not alter the terms of your purchase agreement or the Lenovo Limited Warranty. For more information, see \"Warranty Information\" in the Safety and Warranty Guide that comes with your computer. \nCustomer safety is important. Our products are developed to be safe and effective. However, personal computers are electronic devices. Power adapters and other features can create potential safety risks that can result in physical injury or property damage, especially if misused. To reduce these risks, follow the instructions included with your product, observe all warnings on the product and in the operating instructions, and review the information included in this document carefully. By carefully following the information contained in this document and provided with your product, you can help protect yourself from hazards and create a safer computer work environment. \nNote: This information includes references to power adapters and batteries. In addition to notebook computers, some products (such as speakers and monitors) ship with external power adapters. If you have such a product, this information applies to your product. In addition, computer products contain a coin-sized internal battery that provides power to the system clock even when the computer is unplugged, so the battery safety information applies to all computer products. \n# \nEnsure that you follow the important tips given here to get the most use and enjoyment out of your computer.   \nFailure to do so might lead to discomfort or injury, or cause the computer to fail. \n# \n\nWhen your computer is turned on or the battery is charging, the base, the palm rest, and some other parts may become hot. The temperature they reach depends on the amount of system activity and the level of charge in the battery. \nExtended contact with your body, even through clothing, could cause discomfort or even a skin burn. \n• Avoid keeping your hands, your lap, or any other part of your body in contact with a hot section of the computer for any extended time. • Periodically take hands from using the keyboard by lifting your hands from the palm rest."

For security, a longer password is recommended.   \n• The hard disk drive built into your computer can be protected by UEFI BIOS. To provide reliable security, use the security chip and a security program with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) management feature. See “Setting the security chip” on page 55.   \n• If a Disk Encryption storage drive is installed in your computer, ensure to protect the contents of your computer from unauthorized access by use of drive encryption software, such as Microsoft Windows BitLocker® Drive Encryption.   \n• Before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer, delete the data stored on it. For more information, see “Deleting data from your storage drive” on page 58. \n# \nTo help protect your computer against unauthorized access, use the drive encryption software, such as Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption. \nWindows BitLocker Drive Encryption (referred to as BitLocker) is an integral security feature of some editions of the Windows operating system. It can help you protect the operating system and data stored on your computer, even if your computer is lost or stolen. BitLocker can encrypt all user and system files, including the swap and hibernation files. \nBitLocker uses the TPM to provide enhanced protection for your data and to ensure early boot component integrity. A compatible TPM is defined as a V2.0 TPM. \nTo check the BitLocker status, go to Control Panel, view Control Panel by Category, and click System and Security $\\twoheadrightarrow$ BitLocker Drive Encryption. \nFor more information, see the help system of the Windows operating system, or search for “Microsoft Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Step-by-Step Guide” on the Microsoft Web site. \n# \nSome models contain the Disk Encryption hard disk drive, Encryption solid-state drive, or Encryption hybrid drive. This encryption technology helps to protect your computer against security attacks on media, NAND flash, or device controllers by use of a hardware encryption chip. For the efficient use of the encryption feature, set a hard disk password for the internal storage drive. \n# \nStrict security requirements are imposed on network client computers that transfer confidential information electronically. Depending on the options you ordered, your computer might have an embedded security chip (a cryptographic microprocessor). With the security chip, you can do the following: \n• Protect your data and system • Strengthen access controls • Secure communications \nBefore you start, print these instructions. \nTo set an item on the Security Chip submenu, do the following:"

Handing your computer over to someone else without deleting the installed software, such as operating systems and programs, might even violate the license agreements. Be sure to delete data stored on the storage drive before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer. \nYou can use the following methods to delete data from the storage drive: \n• Move the data to the Recycle Bin, and then empty the Recycle Bin.   \n• Format your storage drive, using the software to initialize it.   \n• Use the recovery program provided by Lenovo to bring the storage drive back to the factory default settings. \nThese operations, however, only change the file location of the data; they do not delete the data itself. The data is still there, even though it seems to be lost. Thus, it is sometimes possible to read the data by use of special software for data recovery. There is a risk that people of bad faith might read and misuse the critical data on storage drives for unexpected purposes. \nTo prevent leakage of data, it is important that you delete all the data from the hard disk drive when you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer. You can destroy the data physically by smashing the hard disk drive with a hammer, or magnetically by means of strong magnetic power, thus making the data unreadable. But it is recommended that you use the software (payware) or service (pay service) developed for that purpose. The process might take several hours. \nFor disposing of data on the solid-state drive, Lenovo provides the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the Cryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool. \nSome computers might support a Disk Encryption hard disk drive or Encryption solid-state drive and have such a drive installed. You can logically dispose of all the data on the drive in a short time by erasing the cryptographic key. The data encrypted with the old key is not physically erased but remains on the drive; however, it cannot be decrypted without the old key.

This topic provides instructions on how to install a Windows 10 operating system. \nBefore you start, print these instructions. \n# \n• It is recommended that you update your operating system through official channels. Any unofficial update might cause security risks.   \n• The process of installing a new operating system deletes all the data on your internal storage drive, including the data that were stored in a hidden folder. \nTo install the Windows 10 operating system, do the following: \n1. Ensure that you set the security chip to TPM 2.0. For more information, see “Setting the security chip” on page 55.   \n2. For computer models that support the Intel Optane™ technology, start the ThinkPad Setup program and select Config $\\twoheadrightarrow$ Storage $\\twoheadrightarrow$ Controller Mode. Ensure that RST mode is selected.   \n3. Connect the drive that contains the operating system installation program to the computer.   \n4. Start the ThinkPad Setup program. See “Using the ThinkPad Setup program” on page 63.   \n5. Select Startup $\\twoheadrightarrow$ Boot to display the Boot Priority Order submenu.   \n6. Select the drive that contains the operating system installation program, for example, USB HDD. Then press Esc.   \n7. Select Restart and ensure that OS Optimized Defaults is enabled. Then press F10 to save the settings and exit the ThinkPad Setup program.   \n8. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the device drivers and necessary programs. See “Installing device drivers” on page 62.   \n9. After installing the device drivers, apply Windows Update to get the latest modules, for example the security patches.   \n10. Depending on your preference, install Lenovo programs. For information about Lenovo programs, see “Lenovo programs” on page 14. \nNote: After installing the operating system, do not change the initial UEFI/Legacy Boot setting in the ThinkPad Setup program. Otherwise, the operating system will not start correctly. \nFor computer models that support the Intel Optane technology, continue to enable the Intel Optane memory by doing the following: \n1. Go to https://support.lenovo.com. Download and install the Intel Rapid Storage Technology (iRST) Console with Device Driver on your computer.   \n2. Run the iRST Console with Device Driver.   \n3.

SMBIOS provides information about the hardware components of your computer. It is the responsibility of the UEFI BIOS to provide information about itself and the devices on the system board. This specification documents the standards for getting access to this BIOS information. \n# \nThe Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) technology makes the computer more manageable by enabling the computer to start from a server. Your computer supports the personal computer functions that PXE requires. For example, with the appropriate LAN card, your computer can be started from the PXE server. \nNote: The Remote Initial Program Load (RIPL or RPL) function cannot be used with your computer."

        "text": "# \nThis chapter provides information about what to do if you experience a problem with your computer. \n# \nThis topic provides the following tips to help you prevent computing problems: \n• Empty your recycle bin on a regular basis.   \n• Use a disk defragment tool regularly on your storage drive to improve data seek and read times.   \n• To free up disk space, uninstall unused programs. You also might want to look for program duplication or overlapping versions.   \n• Clean out your Inbox, Sent, and Trash folders from your e-mail client program.   \n• Back up your data at least once a week. If critical data is present, it is a good idea to back up the data daily. Lenovo has many backup options available for your computer.   \n• Schedule system restore operations to take a system snapshot periodically. For information about system restore, see Chapter 8 “Recovery information” on page 97.   \n• Go to https://support.lenovo.com to download and install updates for the device drivers and UEFI BIOS when needed.   \n• Keep up to date for device drivers on other non-Lenovo hardware. Before updating device drivers, read the device driver information release notes for compatibility or known issues.   \n• Keep a log book. Entries might include major hardware or software changes, driver updates, minor issues you have experienced, and how you resolved the minor issues.   \n• If you ever need to run a recovery on your computer to return the preinstalled contents onto the machine, the following tips might help along the way: 1. Remove all external devices such as the printer and keyboard. 2. Ensure that your battery is charged and your computer has the ac power connected. 3. Access ThinkPad Setup and load the default settings. 4. Restart the computer and start the recovery operation. 5. If your computer uses discs as the recovery media, do not remove the disc from the drive until prompted to do so. \n# \nMany computer problems can be solved without outside assistance. If you experience a problem with your computer, the first place to start is the troubleshooting information in your computer documentation. If you suspect a software problem, see the documentation, including readme files and help information systems, that come with the operating system or program. ThinkPad notebook computers come with a set of diagnostic programs that you can use to help you identify hardware problems. \nNote: If you are unable to isolate and repair the problem yourself after running Lenovo Vantage, save and print the log files created by the program. You need the log files when you speak to a Lenovo technical support representative. \nLenovo Vantage supports the hardware scan function. It combines diagnostic tests, system information collection, security status, and support information, along with hints and tips for optimal system performance. To run Lenovo Vantage, see “Accessing Lenovo programs” on page 14."
