Certain conventions are, however, not identical to those used in Indian Standards.  Attention is particularly drawn to the following: \na) Wherever the words International Standard' appear referring to this standard, they should be read as ‘Indian Standard’.   \nb) Comma (,) has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards, the current practice is to use a point (.) as the decimal marker. \nIn reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)’."
