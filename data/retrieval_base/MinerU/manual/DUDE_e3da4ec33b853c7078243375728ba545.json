For more information call the Connector at 877-MA-ENROLL or visit the Connector website (mahealthconnector.org). \nThis health plan meets the Minimum Creditable Coverage standards that became effective July 1, 2008 as part of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law.

        "text": "# \nThis handbook is a guide to benefits for you and your dependents covered under UniCare State Indemnity Plan/Community Choice (the Community Choice plan). These benefits are provided through the Group Insurance Commission (GIC), the state agency responsible for the design and payment of all benefits for state, participating municipalities and other governmental entities’ employees and retirees. This Plan is funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and administered by UniCare. \nUniCare provides administrative services for UniCare State Indemnity Plan/Community Choice – including claims processing, customer service, pre-service reviews and case management – at its Customer Service Center in Andover, Massachusetts. UniCare is not the fiduciary or the insurer of the Community Choice plan. \nRead this handbook carefully to fully understand your benefits. If you have questions about any of your benefits, see the contact information on page 3. \n# \nUniCare State Indemnity Plan/Community Choice provides comprehensive coverage for many health services including hospital stays, surgery, emergency care, preventive care, outpatient services and other medically necessary treatment. Keep in mind, however, that benefits differ depending on the service and the provider, and that not all services are covered by the Plan. \n# \n Your prescription drug benefits are administered by CVS Caremark. These benefits are described in Part 2 of this handbook (pages 107-121). \n Your behavioral health benefits are administered by Beacon Health Options. These benefits include coverage for mental health, substance use disorder and the Enrollee Assistance Program (EAP). They are described in Part 3 of this handbook (pages 123-147). \n# \nIf you or a family member is covered under another health plan, you must let UniCare know about the other plan. When you received your member materials (including this handbook), you should have filled out and returned the Other Health Insurance form. If you have other health coverage and haven’t yet filled out this form, please call UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 to request one. \nTo learn more about how UniCare coordinates benefits with other health plans, turn to “Coordination of Benefits (COB)” on page 94."

        "text": "# \n# \nMember costs are the costs for medical care that are your responsibility to pay (they are sometimes called out-of-pocket costs). There are three different types of member costs. These costs are separate and unrelated; they apply in different situations and are for different services. The three types of member costs which are described in this chapter are: \nDeductible – This is a fixed amount you pay toward medical services each year before the Plan starts paying benefits for those services. Once you have paid the full amount, you won’t owe any more deductible until the start of the following plan year. See page 21 for details about the deductible. \n Copays (copayments) – A copay is a set amount you pay when you get certain medical services. For example, you pay a copay when you see your doctor for a sore throat, or when you get outpatient surgery at a hospital. The dollar amount of your copay varies based on the service you’re getting and the provider you’re using. See pages 21-25 for details about copays. \n Coinsurance – This is your share of the cost of a covered service when the service isn’t covered at $100\\%$ . For example, if the Plan pays $80\\%$ of the allowed amount for a service, you are responsible for paying the other $20\\%$ . See page 25. \n\nImportant! You have different copays and coinsurance for certain services at Community Choice and non-Community Choice hospitals. Always use Community Choice hospitals to get the maximum benefit. Appendix B lists all the Community Choice hospitals. \nThere are caps that limit how much you could pay each plan year for these member costs. See pages 25-26 for details about the out-of-pocket limits and the non-Community Choice coinsurance limit. \nWhat is a plan year? The plan year starts on July 1 each year and ends the following June 30th. \n# \nWhen UniCare gets a claim for medical services that you or someone in your family had, we subtract any member costs you owe from the amount we pay to that provider. If there is a copay, that gets subtracted first. Then, the deductible – if it applies – is subtracted, and finally the coinsurance, if any. If you owe any member costs, we’ll send you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statement that shows you how the claim has been paid and what you owe to the provider. \nAfter receiving payment from UniCare, your provider will send you a bill for the amount of your member costs; that is, the amount UniCare subtracted from the bill before paying the provider. \nNote that we process your claims as they arrive at UniCare. This means that your claims may not be paid in the same order in which you got the medical services."

        "text": "# \nThe deductible is a set amount you pay toward medical services each plan year before UniCare starts paying benefits for those services. Your deductible starts on July 1 each year. Depending on how much a claim is for, it may take more than one claim before your deductible is satisfied (fully paid). \nThe deductible applies to many, but not all, covered services. For example, you owe your deductible for inpatient hospital care, but not for occupational therapy. Inpatient hospital care is subject to the deductible, but occupational therapy is not. Chapter 3 shows which services are subject to the deductible. \nYou have one deductible that applies to both your medical claims and any claims you have for out-ofnetwork behavioral health (mental health/substance use disorder) services. The deductible amounts are shown in Table 2. \nTable 2. Deductible Amounts \n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\nForanindividual & $3o0foroneperson \\\\\nForafamily & $9o0 for the entirefamily \\\\\n & For any one person in the family, the deductible is capped at $300 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nThe $\\$300$ individual deductible is the amount you must pay each plan year before UniCare starts to pay for many medical services and out-of-network behavioral health services. \nExample – In July, you get behavioral health services from an out-of-network provider and pay $\\$200$ toward your deductible. You now have $\\$100$ of your deductible left. In August, you go to a provider for medical care. If this second bill is more than $\\$100$ , you pay $\\$100$ – the rest of your deductible – and the Plan pays the covered amount of the remaining charges. However, if this second bill is less than $\\$100$ , then the rest of your deductible will be taken the next time you go to a medical or out-of-network behavioral health provider. \n# \nThe $\\$900$ family deductible is the most your family could pay each plan year before UniCare starts to pay for many medical services or out-of-network behavioral health services. The most you’ll owe for any one family member is $\\$300$ , until the family as a whole reaches the $\\$900$ limit. \nExample – In July, you and your two children go to providers for medical care. All three of you pay $\\$230$ deductibles, for a total of $\\$750$ toward the family deductible. In August, your spouse goes to an out-of-network behavioral health provider and pays $\\$150$ deductible. Even though no single family member has reached the $\\$300$ cap, the family deductible of $\\$900$ has been met. Therefore, no additional deductible will apply to your family for the rest of the plan year. \n# \nA copay (copayment) is a set amount you pay when you get certain medical services. For example, you pay a copay when you see your doctor for a sore throat, or when you get outpatient surgery at a hospital. The dollar amount of your copay depends on what service you’re getting, what kind of provider you’re seeing, and whether you’re using a Community Choice or non-Community Choice hospital. See the tables on pages 24-25 for a list of services and copay amounts."

        "text": "Copays can work in two ways: \n Per-occurrence copays – These are copays you pay every time you have a particular service. Per-occurrence copays apply to inpatient hospital care and outpatient surgery at non-Community Choice hospitals. Doctor visits, high-tech imaging, physical therapy, occupational therapy and emergency room visits are also per-occurrence copays. Quarterly copays – You pay quarterly copays only once each calendar quarter, no matter how many times you get that service during the quarter. There are quarterly copays for inpatient hospital care and outpatient surgery at Community Choice hospitals. \nWhat is a calendar quarter? The calendar quarters are July/August/September, October/November/December, January/February/March, and April/May/June. \n# \nYour copay for inpatient hospital services depends on where you go for your care. \nInpatient services at Community Choice hospitals or under special circumstances \nYour copay for inpatient hospital services will be lowest under any of the following circumstances: \n1. You get your inpatient care at a Community Choice hospital   \n2. You go to a designated hospital for any of the complex procedures listed in Table 10 (page 52)   \n3. You go to a Quality Center and Designated Hospital for a transplant (page 64)   \n4. You get care at an acute rehabilitation facility \nIn any of these situations, your inpatient hospital copay is a per-person quarterly copay. Each time you or a covered dependent is admitted to a hospital, you owe this copay. However, once you pay this copay during a calendar quarter, you won’t have to pay it again for this person during the same quarter. \nExample – You are admitted to a Community Choice hospital in July and stay overnight, so you owe this copay. If you are readmitted to a Community Choice hospital in September, you won’t owe another copay because July and September are in the same calendar quarter. But if you are readmitted to a hospital in November, you will have to pay the copay again. \n# \nWhen you use a non-Community Choice hospital, the inpatient copay is a per-person, per-admission copay. You must pay this copay each time you or a covered dependent is admitted to a non-Community Choice hospital for anything other than the cases listed above (and again in Table 4 on page 24). You will also owe coinsurance when you get inpatient services at a non-Community Choice hospital. \nExample – You are admitted to a non-Community Choice hospital in July and stay overnight, so you owe this copay. If you are readmitted to a non-Community Choice hospital in September, you owe another copay even though the admissions are in the same calendar quarter, because the inpatient copay applies to each admission. \n# \nIf you are readmitted to either a Community Choice or non-Community Choice hospital within 30 days of the date of your last hospital stay, you won’t owe another inpatient hospital copay if both admissions are in the same plan year. This is true even if the two admissions occur in different calendar quarters."

        "text": "Example – You are admitted to the hospital at the end of September and then readmitted in October (within 30 days of your September discharge). You don’t owe another copay, even though the admissions are in different calendar quarters. But if you are readmitted to a hospital in November (more than 30 days from your September discharge), you will have to pay the copay again. \nIf you have two hospital admissions in different plan years, you will owe a copay for each admission, even if the readmission occurs within 30 days. \nExample – You are admitted to the hospital at the end of June and then are readmitted in the beginning of July. You must pay a copay for each admission, even though the two admissions occur within 30 days of each other. \n# \nYour copay for outpatient surgery depends on where you have your surgery. \n# \nThe outpatient surgery copay at Community Choice hospitals is a per-person quarterly copay. Each time you or a covered dependent has outpatient surgery at a Community Choice hospital, you owe this copay. However, once you pay this copay during a calendar quarter, you won’t have to pay it again for this person during the same quarter. \nExample – You have outpatient surgery at a Community Choice hospital in July, so you owe the outpatient surgery copay on the hospital charges. If you have another outpatient hospital surgery in September, you won’t owe another copay, because July and September are in the same calendar quarter. But if you have outpatient surgery at a hospital in November, you will have to pay the copay again. \n# \nThe outpatient surgery copay at a non-Community Choice hospital is a per-person, per-occurrence copay. You must pay this copay each time you or a covered dependent has surgery at one of these hospitals. You will also owe coinsurance when you have outpatient surgery at a non-Community Choice hospital. \nExample – You have outpatient surgery at a non-Community Choice hospital in July, so you owe the outpatient surgery copay. If you have another outpatient hospital surgery in September, you owe another copay even though the admissions are in the same calendar quarter, because the outpatient surgery copay at a non-Community Choice hospital applies to each admission. \n# \nThere’s no outpatient surgery copay if you have your surgery at a non-hospital-owned ambulatory surgery center or doctor’s office. \n# \nTable 3 lists the copays you will have for office visits and services with different kinds of providers, including primary care providers and specialists. \nImportant! Some specialists may also provide primary care. If so, they will be considered specialists when we determine their tier and copay assignments. This means you will pay the specialist office visit copay whether you see the specialist for a primary care or specialty care visit."

Keeping these tips in mind will help you avoid paying more than you need to for your care. \n# \n# \n See Tier 1 or Tier 2 specialists – Tier 1 and Tier 2 specialists have demonstrated quality and/or cost efficiency in their practices. Your copays are lower when you use Tier 1 or Tier 2 specialists. See pages 79-80 for more information about physician tiering. \n Use Community Choice hospitals – Your copays are lower at Community Choice hospitals, and all inpatient care and outpatient surgery is covered at $100\\%$ . Non-Community Choice hospitals are covered at $80\\%$ so you’ll owe $20\\%$ coinsurance, and the copays are higher. \nTo compare your benefits at Community Choice hospitals and non-Community Choice hospitals, see Chapter 3. See Appendix B for a list of Community Choice hospitals. \n Use UniCare preferred vendors – Services from preferred vendors are covered at $100\\%$ . When you use non-preferred vendors, services are covered at $80\\%$ , so you’ll owe $20\\%$ coinsurance. And, outside of Massachusetts, non-preferred vendors may balance bill you for charges over the Plan’s allowed amounts. (Note that your deductible may also apply, no matter which type of vendor you use.) \nIn this handbook, the checkmark  identifies services that have preferred vendors. For more information, see “About preferred vendors” on page 27. \n Have outpatient surgery at a non-hospital-owned location – You don’t have an outpatient surgery copay when you have your surgery at a non-hospital-owned ambulatory surgery center or doctor’s office. \n Take advantage of non-hospital-owned walk-in clinics for non-emergency care – You’ll have a $\\$20$ copay if you go to a walk-in clinic, like an urgent care center, instead of a hospital emergency room. Just make sure the clinic isn’t owned by a hospital. Hospital-owned urgent care centers often bill your visits as emergency room treatment, which means you would owe the $\\$100$ emergency room copay. \n# \nIf you need urgent care while traveling, use a Travel Access provider – Always use Travel Access providers if you need urgent care when you aren’t in Massachusetts. \nMake sure your out-of-state student dependent uses Travel Access providers – Covered students who attend school outside Massachusetts should use Travel Access providers when they need urgent care. However, to avoid being balance billed, they must get all their non-urgent care – including annual checkups – at home in Massachusetts."

These benefits are administered by Beacon, not by UniCare. See Part 3 (pages 123-147) for information about these benefits. \n# \n Be sure to provide notice if you will be having any of the services or procedures listed in Table 1 (pages 16-19). Your benefit may be reduced by up to $\\$500$ if you don’t provide enough notice.

For details, see “When you must provide notice about your care” on pages 14-19. \n# \nThis handbook talks about many different providers of medical care and services. Here’s a brief look at what to know about the different kinds of providers. \nTo find health care providers, go to the Members page at unicarestateplan.com and choose Find a doctor. You can also call UniCare Customer Service at 800-442-9300 for help. \n# \nWe strongly encourage all UniCare members to choose a primary care provider, or PCP. Having a PCP means working with a provider who is familiar with you and your health care needs. Your PCP can help you understand and coordinate care you get from other providers, such as specialists, who may not know you as well. \nA PCP can be a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or physician whose specialty is family medicine, general medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics or internal medicine. \nImportant! Some specialists may also provide primary care. If so, they will be considered specialists when we determine their tier and copay assignments. This means you will pay the specialist office visit copay, whether you see the specialist for a primary care or specialty care visit. \n# \nMany PCPs in Massachusetts belong to practices that are in UniCare’s Patient-Centered Primary Care program, part of the GIC’s Centered Care Initiative. \nThe Centered Care Initiative seeks to improve health care coordination and quality while reducing costs. PCPs play a critical role in helping their patients get the right care at the right place with the right provider. The central idea is to coordinate health care services around the needs of you – the patient. Because health care is so expensive, Centered Care also seeks to engage providers and health plans on managing these dollars more efficiently. \nThe Patient-Centered Primary Care program is UniCare’s application of the Centered Care initiative. Patient-Centered Primary Care practices are Massachusetts primary care practices that participate in the program. \nYou can find more information about the Patient-Centered Primary Care program at unicarestateplan.com."

When you do seek specialty care, you’ll have lower office visit copays when you use Tier 1 and Tier 2 specialists. \n# \nWhen you need inpatient or outpatient hospital services, your costs will be lowest when: \n You go to a Community Choice hospital for your care (Appendix B).   \n You go to a designated hospital for any of the procedures listed in Table 10 (page 52).   \n You go to a Quality Center or Designated Hospital for a transplant (page 64).   \n You get care at an acute rehabilitation facility. \nYou’ll have higher member costs for all other inpatient and outpatient hospital care at non-Communit Choice hospitals.

Physician tiering is a program implemented by the Plan whereby Massachusetts specialists are assigned to different tiers based on an extensive evaluation of both their quality and cost efficiency. \nUnder this program, we assign individual Massachusetts specialists to tiers based on how they score on quality and/or cost efficiency compared to the other physicians in the same specialty. We use this comparison to place specialists into one of three tiers, as described below. The names of the tiers have been assigned by the GIC for use uniformly across all of its participating health plans. \n# \nTier 1 specialists have met or exceeded the quality threshold we established for their specialty. Based on our measures, they also showed that they are the most cost efficient compared to their peers in the same medical specialty. Tier 1 is designed to acknowledge the performance of these physicians in terms of both quality and/or cost-efficiency measures, as determined by the available claims data and the standards we use."

When you choose your physicians, you may rely on other information that we cannot get through claims data. You may also rely on your own views about what quality means.

See Appendix E for instructions on how to file an appeal. \nAppeals for prescription drug or behavioral health services – These appeals must be filed with the administrator of those services. For prescription drug appeals, see Part 2 (pages 107-121). For mental health, substance use disorder and EAP appeals, see Part 3 (pages 123-147). \n# \nAs explained in “When you must provide notice about your care” on page 14, either UniCare or AIM Specialty Health must be notified if you are scheduled to have any of the services listed in Table 1 (pages 16-19). These services are reviewed to make sure they are eligible for benefits. Pre-service reviews are a standard practice of most health plans. These reviews help ensure that benefits are paid appropriately for services that meet the Plan’s definition of medical necessity. \nThe clinical criteria used for these reviews are developed with input from actively practicing physicians, and in accordance with the standards adopted by the national accreditation organizations. The criteria are regularly updated as new treatments, applications and technologies become generally-accepted professional medical practice. \nA UniCare nurse may speak with your health care providers to determine if a service is eligible for benefits. The nurse will also review your clinical situation and circumstances. \nIf the nurse is unable to make a determination, the Plan will invite your provider to speak with one of UniCare’s physician advisors to discuss the proposed treatment and/or the treatment setting. Once a decision is made, UniCare will contact your provider directly, and you will be notified in writing. \n# \nIf your request has been denied either before or while you are getting health care services, you or your doctor may ask for reconsideration. Your request can be made by phone or in writing. The reconsideration process gives your doctor the opportunity to speak with another clinical peer reviewer who was not involved in the original denial. \nFor an immediate reconsideration, the UniCare Customer Service Center must get the request and all supporting information within three business days of when you received the denial. The reconsideration will take place within two business days after all necessary supporting documents have been received. The decision is then communicated in writing to you and your doctor. \nIf the denial is upheld, you can appeal the decision. See Appendix E for instructions on how to file an appeal."

        "text": "# \nIt is common for family members to be covered by more than one health care plan. This happens, for example, when spouses or partners have family coverage through both of their employers or former employers. When you or your dependents are covered by more than one health plan, one plan is identified as the primary plan for coordination of benefits (COB). Any other plan is then the secondary plan. The goal of COB is to determine how much each plan should pay when you have a claim, and to make sure that the combined payments of all plans do not add up to more than your covered health care expenses. \n# \nFor the purposes of COB, the term plan is defined as any plan that provides medical or dental care coverage. Examples include, but are not limited to, group or blanket coverage; group practice or other group prepayment coverage, including hospital or medical services coverage; labor-management trusteed plans; union welfare plans; employer organization plans; employee benefit organization plans; automobile no-fault coverage; and coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law, including any legally required, no-fault motor vehicle liability insurance. (This does not include a state plan under Medicaid or any plan when, by law, its benefits are in excess of those of any private insurance program or other non-governmental program.) \nThe term plan does not include school-accident type plans or coverage that you purchased on a non-group basis. \n# \nIf the UniCare State Indemnity Plan is the primary plan, benefit payments will be made as if the secondary plan or plans did not exist. A secondary plan may reduce its benefits if payments were made by the UniCare State Indemnity Plan. \nIf another plan is primary, benefit payments under the UniCare State Indemnity Plan are determined in the following manner: \na) The Plan determines its covered expenses – that is, what the Plan would pay in the absence of other insurance; then   \nb) The Plan subtracts the primary plan’s benefits – benefits paid by the other plan, or the reasonable cash value of any benefits in the form of services – from the covered expenses in (a) above; and then   \nc) The Plan pays the difference, if any, between (a) and (b). \nThe following are the rules used by the UniCare State Indemnity Plan (and most other plans) to determine which plan is the primary plan and which plan is the secondary plan: \n1. The plan without a COB provision is primary.   \n2. The plan that covers the person as an employee, member, or retiree (that is, other than as a dependent) is primary, and the plan that covers the person as a dependent is secondary.   \n3. The order of coverage for a dependent child who is covered under both parents’ plans is determined by the birthday rule, as follows: a) The primary plan is the plan of the parent whose birthday falls first in the calendar year, or b) If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the primary plan is the plan tha has covered a parent for the longest period of time \nHowever, if the other plan has a rule based on the gender of the parent, and if the plans do not agree on the order of coverage, the rules of the other plan will determine the order."

According to the active before retiree rule, the plan that covers a person as an active employee is primary, and the plan that covers that same person as a retiree is secondary.

However, if the other plan’s rule is based on length of coverage, and if the plans do not agree on the order of coverage, the rules of the other plan will determine the order. \nIf none of the above rules can be applied, the plan that has covered the person for a longer period of time is primary, and the plan that has covered that same person for the shorter period of time is secondary. \n# \nIn order to fulfill the terms of this COB provision or any similar provision: \n A claimant must provide the Plan with all necessary information  The Plan may obtain from or release information to any other person or entity as necessary \n# \nA payment made under another plan may include an amount that should have been paid by the UniCare State Indemnity Plan.

The dollar amount of the copay depends on the service it applies to. Not all services have copays. \nCosmetic services (page 70) – Services performed mainly to improve appearance. These services do not restore bodily function or correct functional impairment. Cosmetic services are not covered. \nCustodial care (page 70) – A level of care that is chiefly designed to assist a person in the activities of daily living and cannot reasonably be expected to greatly restore health or bodily function. \nDeductible (page 21) – A set amount you must pay toward covered health care services before the Plan starts to pay. For example, if your deductible is $\\$300$ , the Plan won’t pay anything until you’ve paid that amount toward services that are subject to the deductible.

In addition, with the exception of the over-the-counter versions of Preventive Drugs, medications are covered only if a prescription is required for their dispensing. Diabetes supplies and insulin are also covered by the plan. \nThe plan categorizes medications into seven major categories: \n# \nGeneric versions of brand medications contain the same active ingredients as their brand counterparts, thus offering the same clinical value. The FDA requires generic drugs to be just as strong, pure and stable as brand-name drugs. They must also be of the same quality and manufactured to the same rigorous standards. These requirements help to assure that generic drugs are as safe and effective as brand-name drugs. \n# \nA maintenance drug is a medication taken on a regular basis for chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. \n# \nA non-preferred brand-name drug is a medication that usually has an alternative therapeutically equivalent drug available on the formulary. \n# \nA preferred brand-name drug, also known as a formulary drug, is a medication that has been reviewed and approved by a group of physicians and pharmacists, and has been selected by CVS Caremark for formulary inclusion based on its proven clinical and cost effectiveness. \n# \nPreventive drugs consist primarily of drugs recommended for coverage by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and as specified by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Once you begin using mail service, or the option of your local CVS Pharmacy, you can order refills online or by phone. \n# \nTo begin using mail service for your prescriptions, just follow these three simple steps: \n1. Ask your physician to write a prescription for up to a 90-day supply of your maintenance medication plus refills for up to one year, if appropriate. (Remember also to ask for a second prescription for an initial 30-day supply and take it to your local participating retail pharmacy.)   \n2.

Prior Authorization ensures that you are receiving the appropriate drug for the treatment of a specific condition, in quantities approved by the FDA. For select drugs, prior authorization also includes a medical necessity review that ensures the use of less expensive first-line formulary prescription drugs before the plan will pay for more expensive prescription drugs. First-line formulary prescription drugs are safe and effective medications used for the treatment of medical conditions or diseases. \nIf a drug that you take requires prior authorization, your physician will need to contact CVS Caremark to see if the prescription meets the plan’s conditions for coverage. If you are prescribed a drug that requires prior authorization, your physician should call CVS Caremark Prior Authorization at 800-294-5979."

Out-of-network benefits are paid based on allowed amounts, which are Beacon’s “reasonable and customary” fees, a percentage of Medicare, or negotiated fee maximums. Allowed amounts are subject to change at any time without notice. If your out-of-network provider or facility charges more than these allowed amounts, you may be balance billed (asked to pay for charges above the allowed amount). Beacon does not cover balance bills. \nBeacon’s in-network providers must accept the Plan’s allowed amounts, so you won’t be balance billed as long as you use providers in the Beacon network. Call Beacon at 855-750-8980 (TDD: 866-727-9441) for help finding an in-network provider. \nYou have a deductible of $\\$300$ for one person or $\\$900$ for the entire family for out-of-network mental health and substance use disorder treatment. \nThe out-of-pocket limit for out-of-network services is $\\$3,000$ for one person.

If you are considering joining a non-GIC plan, you should compare your current coverage – particularly which drugs are covered, and at what cost – with that of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage can be found at the end of this notice. \nFor most people, the drug coverage that you currently have through your GIC health plan is a better value than the Medicare drug plans. \nThere are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare’s prescription drug coverage: \n1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available to everyone with Medicare in 2006. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage.

The GIC has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by your plan is, on average for all participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage.

If you are disenrolled from CVS Caremark, you will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.   \n If you are the insured and decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan, both you and your covered spouse/dependents will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.   \n If you have limited income and assets, the Social Security Administration offers help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage. Help is available online at socialsecurity.gov or by phone at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778). \n# \nYou should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with a GIC plan and don’t join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later. \nIf you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least $1\\%$ of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least $19\\%$ higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium.

USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. The GIC has more generous guidelines for benefit coverage that apply to persons subject to USERRA, as set forth below: \n If you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your dependents while in the military.  Service members who elect to continue their GIC health coverage are required to pay the employee’s share for such coverage.  Even if you don’t elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated to GIC health coverage when you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. \nThe U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations. \nFor assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 866-4-USA-DOL or visit its website at www.dol.gov/vets. An interactive online USERRA Advisor can be viewed at www.dol.gov/elaws/userra.htm. If you file a complaint with VETS and VETS is unable to resolve it, you may request that your case be referred to the Department of Justice or the Office of Special Counsel, as applicable, for representation.

The ACA brought many benefits to Massachusetts and its residents, helping us expand coverage to more Massachusetts residents, making it more affordable for small businesses to offer their employees healthcare, and providing additional tools to help families, individuals and businesses find affordable coverage. This notice is meant to help you understand health insurance marketplaces, which are required by the ACA to make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the state marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector. While you may or may not qualify for health insurance through the Health Connector, it may still be helpful for you to read and understand the information included here. \n# \nThere is an easy way for many individuals and small businesses in Massachusetts to buy health insurance: the Massachusetts Health Connector. This notice provides some basic information about the Health Connector, and how coverage available through the Health Connector relates to any coverage that may be offered by your employer. You can find out more by visiting: MAhealthconnector.org, or for non-Massachusetts residents, Healthcare.gov or (800-318-2596; TTY: 855-889-4325). \n# \nThe Health Connector is our state’s health insurance marketplace. It is designed to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health insurance that meets their needs and fits their budget. The Health Connector offers “one-stop shopping” to easily find and compare private health insurance options from the state’s leading health and dental insurance companies. Some individuals and families may also qualify for a new kind of tax credit that lowers their monthly premium right away, as well as cost sharing reductions that can lower out-of-pocket expenses. This new tax credit is enabled by $\\S26\\mathrm{B}$ of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code. \nOpen enrollment for individuals and families to buy health insurance coverage through the Health Connector occurs every year. You can find out more by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 877-MA ENROLL (877-623-6765). \n# \nDepending on your income, you may qualify for federal and/or state tax credits and other subsidies that reduce your premiums and lower your out-of-pocket expenses if you shop through the Health Connector. You can find out more about the income criteria for qualifying for these subsidies by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 877-MA ENROLL (877-623-6765)."

Also, please note that the amount that you and your employer contribute to your employer-sponsored health insurance is often excluded from federal and state income taxes.

To be eligible for GIC health insurance, a state employee must work a minimum of $18\\%$ hours in a 37.5 hour work week or 20 hours in a 40 hour work week. The employee must contribute to a participating GIC retirement system, such as the State Board of Retirement, a municipal retirement board, the Teachers Retirement Board, the Optional Retirement Pension System for Higher Education, a Housing, Redevelopment Retirement Plan, or another Massachusetts public sector retirement system (OBRA is not such a public retirement system for this purpose). Visit www.mass.gov/gic or see your GIC coordinator for more information.  Temporary employees, contractors, less-than-half time part time workers, and most seasonal employees are not eligible for GIC health insurance benefits. These employees may shop for health insurance through the Health Connector and may be eligible for advanced premium federal tax credits and/or state subsidies if their gross family income is at or below $400\\%$ federal poverty level (which is approximately $\\$46,000$ for an individual and $\\$94,000$ for a family of four).

If you or your children are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you will not be eligible for these premium assistance programs, but you may be able to buy individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information visit www.healthcare.gov. \nIf you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a state listed below, contact your state Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available. \nIf you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your state Medicaid or CHIP office, or dial 877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan. \nIf you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you are not already enrolled. This is called a “special enrollment” opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance. If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor electronically at www.askebsa.dol.gov or call 866-444-EBSA (3272). \nIf you live in one of the following states, you may be eligible for assistance paying your employer health plan premiums. The following list of states is current as of January 31, 2016. Contact your state for further information on eligibility."

        "text": "# \nThis appendix describes how UniCare handles member appeals in accordance with federal regulations. \nFor purposes of these appeal provisions, “claim for benefits” means a request for benefits under the Plan. The term includes both pre-service and post-service claims. \n A pre-service claim is a claim for benefits under the plan for which you have not received the benefit or for which you may need to obtain approval in advance.   \n A post-service claim is any other claim for benefits under the plan for which you have received the service. \nIf your claim is denied or if your coverage is rescinded: \n You will be provided with a written notice of the denial or rescission; and  You are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial or rescission. \nA rescission is a retroactive termination of coverage as a result of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of material fact. A cancellation or discontinuance of coverage is not a rescission if the cancellation has a prospective effect or if the cancellation is due to a failure to timely pay required premiums or contributions toward the cost of coverage. \nThe procedure UniCare follows satisfies the requirements for a full and fair review under applicable federal regulations. \n# \nIf your claim is denied, UniCare’s notice of the adverse benefit determination (denial) will include the following, when applicable: \n Information sufficient to identify the claim involved;   \n The specific reasons for the denial;   \n A reference to the plan provisions on which UniCare’s determination is based;   \n A description of any additional material or information needed to reconsider your claim;   \n An explanation of why the additional material or information is needed;   \n A description of the plan’s review procedures and the time limits that apply to them;   \n Information about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making the claim determination, and about your right to request a copy of it free of charge;   \n Information about your right to a discussion of the claims denial decision;   \n Information about the scientific or clinical judgment for any determination based on medical necessity or experimental treatment, and about your right to request this explanation free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision; and   \n The availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman who may assist you."

You or your authorized representative must file your appeal within 180 calendar days after you are notified of the denial or rescission. You will have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting your claim. UniCare’s review of your claim will take into account all information you submit, regardless of whether it was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. \nUniCare shall offer an appeals process and an external review process. In cases involving eligibility for coverage, you may only appeal; there is no external review. The time frame allowed for UniCare to complete its review is dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g., pre-service, concurrent, post-service, urgent, etc.). \n# \nYou may obtain an expedited appeal.

The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination. \nIf the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether the treatment is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the judgment. This health care professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier determination or who works for one who was consulted in making an earlier determination. \n# \n# \nUniCare will notify you of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of your request for appeal. \n# \nUniCare will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal. \n# \nUniCare will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal. \n# \nIf your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification from UniCare will include all pertinent information set forth in “Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination” on page 167."

        "text": "# \nIf the outcome of the appeal is adverse to you, you may be eligible for an independent external review pursuant to federal law. \nUnless you are filing an expedited external review, you must first file an appeal with UniCare before you can pursue an external review. You must submit your request for external review to UniCare within four months of the notice of UniCare’s adverse determination of your appeal. \nA request for an external review must be in writing unless UniCare determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re-send the information that you submitted for your appeal. However, you are encouraged to submit any additional information that you think is important for review. \nFor pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may proceed with an expedited external review without filing an appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal. You or your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including UniCare’s decision, can be exchanged by telephone, fax, or other similar method. \nTo proceed with an expedited external review, you or your authorized representative must contact UniCare at the number shown on your UniCare ID card and provide at least the following information: \n The identity of the claimant;   \n The dates of the medical service;   \n The specific medical condition or symptom;   \n The provider’s name;   \n The service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and  Any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. \nAll other requests for external review should be submitted in writing unless UniCare determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. Such requests should be submitted by you or your authorized representative to: \nUniCare State Indemnity Plan P.O. Box 2011 Andover, MA 01810 \nThis is not an additional step that you must take in order to fulfill your appeal procedure obligations described above. Your decision to seek external review will not affect your rights to any other benefits under this health care plan. The external review decision is final and binding on all parties except for any relief available through applicable state laws."
