It makes this solution completely undetectable by the targets or the operators unlike active interception solutions in the markets. Thanks to its dense FPGA architecture, this solution is able to intercept up to 60000 communications per hour, which enables this solution to be suited for massive application (border control for example), the go2INTERCEPT (passive) is able to demodulate and decipher in real time up to 320 duplex communication. \n\nTwo versions of go2INTERCEPT (passive) are available either in a 2U format for low cost application (up to 20 full duplex simulta-neous communication) or in a 3U format to get the full power of the systems. \nThe front end can be connected to the deciphering box (go2DECIPHER) through ethernet connection using either Vsat, 3G or cable links. In the case of a powerful deciphering box, multiple front ends can be connected. \n#"

        "text": "# \ngo2INTERCEPT (active extended) is designed to perform man-in-the-middle attacks for mobile phones over GSM (2G, 2.5G) and UMTS (3G) networks. \nThe system emulates a real cell (base station) attempting the surrounding phones to select and register to the fake cell. As a result, the system becomes the serving cell of the surrounding phones (all phones or only designated phones) and consequently controls the phones communication. \n\nAs such, the system is used to extract the target identity, to track the target location, to monitor the target communication and to manipulate the target phone in advanced methods. \n# \n# \ngo2INTERCEPT (active extended) conducts seamless interception of target inbound and outbound and SMS over GSM networks with-out cooperation or authorization from the GSM operator. The system can monitor as much targets as required and handle multiple live calls simulta-neously. \n# \nBesides of monitoring the target calls and SMS, the system allows to manipulate the target communication in various ways: \n· Block or disconnect specific or all calls and SMSmessages of any target.   \n· Send fake SMS messages (fake content and fake identity) to the target or on behalf of the target.   \n· Reroute calls and SMS from/to the target.   \n: Change SMS content that was sent from/to the target. \n# \nThe system allows to extract the identity of any phone in the area and also to alert about the presence of specific phones or targets in a certain area. \n# \nThe system can block the communication of all phones in a certain area or to block the communication of only specific phones. \nFind a target \nThe system force the phone to transmit a seamless signal. The phone signal is tracked by a dedicated receiver and allows getting closer to the target till final resolution of its position. \n# \nSince interception is not possible over 3G networks, the 3G module generates a signal to the 3G phones that cause them to move to the GSM network. \nOnce the phone moves to the GSM network, the GSM module takes over and conducts the interception of the target as well as all other actions that are described above."
