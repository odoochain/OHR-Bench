        "text": "# \nIf you will be gone a month or more: \n1. Remove all food from the refrigerator.   \n2. Turn off the water supply to the ice maker at least one day ahead of time.   \n3. When the last load of ice drops, turn off the ice maker. Make sure all ice is dispensed out of the ice maker mechanism.   \n4. Unplug the refrigerator.   \n5. Clean it, rinse well, and dry.   \n6. Tape rubber or wood blocks to the tops of both doors to prop them open far enough for air to get in. This stops odor and mold from building up. \n# \n# \nDo not allow children to climb on, play near, or climb inside the refrigerator when the doors are blocked open. They may become injured or trapped. \nTo restart refrigerator, see \"Using Your Refrigerator' on page 8. \n# \nWhen you are moving the refrigerator to a new home: \n1. Turn off the water supply to the ice maker at least one day ahead of time.   \n2. Disconnect the water line.   \n3. After the last load of ice drops, lift the signal arm to the OFF (up) position.   \n4. Remove all food from the refrigerator.   \n5. Pack atl frozen food in dry ice.   \n6. Unplug the refrigerator.   \n7. Clean it thoroughly. Rinse well and dry.   \n8. Take out all removable parts, wrap them well, and tape them together so they don't shift and rattle.   \n9. Screw in the leveling rollers.   \n10. Tape the doors shut and tape the power supply cord to the cabinet. \nWhen you get to your new home, put everything back and refer to page 6. Also, remember to reconnect the water supply line. \n# \nIf electricity goes off, call the power company. Ask how long power will be off. \n1. If service will be interrupted 24 hours or less, keep both doors closed. This helps foods stay frozen. \n2. If service will be interupted longer than 24 hours: (a) Remove all frozen food and store in a frozen food locker. OR (b) Place 32 grams of dry ice in freezer for every liter (2 Ibs. for every cubic foot) of freezer space. This will keep food frozen for 2 to 4 days. Wear gloves to protect your hands from dry ice burns. \n# \n(c) If neither a food locker or dry ice is available, use or can perishable food at once. \n3. A full freezer stays cold longer than a partly filled one.A freezer full of meat stays cold longer than a freezer full of baked goods. If food contains ice crystals, it may be safely refrozen, although the quality and flavor may be affected. If the condition of the food is poor, or if you feel it is unsafe, dispose of it."

        "text": "# \nThe freezer section is designed for storage of commercially frozen food and for freezing food at home. \nNOTE: For further information about preparing food for freezing or food storage times, check a freezer guide or reliable cookbook. \n# \nThe secret of successful freezing is in the packaging. The way you close and seal the package must not allow air or moisture in or out. Packaging done in any other way could cause food odor and taste transfer throughout the refrigerator and drying of frozen food. \n# \n· Rigid plastic containers with tight-fitting lids   \n· Straight-sided canning/freezing jars   \n· Heavy-duty aluminum foil   \n· Plastic-coated paper   \n· Non-permeable plastic wraps (made from a saran film) \nFollow package or container instructions for proper freezing methods. \n# \n· Bread wrappers   \n· Non-polyethylene plastic containers   \n· Containers without tight lids   \n· Wax paper   \n· Wax-coated freezer wrap   \n· Thin, semi-permeable wrap \nThe use of these wrappings could cause food odor, taste transfer, and drying of frozen food. \n# \nDo not expect your freezer to quick-freeze any large quantity of food. Put no more unfrozenfood into thefreezer than will freeze within 24 hours (no more than 32 to 48 grams of food per liter [2 to 3 lbs. per cubic foot] of freezer space). Leave enough space for air to circulate around packages. Be careful to leave enough room at the front so the door can close tightly. \nStorage times will vary according to the quality of the food, the type of packaging or wrap used (airtight and moisture-proof), and the storage temperature, which should be $\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}17.8^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$ $(0^{\\circ}\\mathsf{F})$"
