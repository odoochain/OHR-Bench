We are always seeking to improve our program and the treatment we provide to our clients. We appreciate the time you have taken to assist us in this process. Set forth below you will find our proposed Corrective Action Plan. We have included some footnotes throughout the Corrective Action Plan for clarification purposes. Again, thanks for your assistance in this matter. \n# \n# \nAn incident occurred on June 21, 2018 that resulted in a client being physically abused by Havenwood staff. The client was then zip-tied on the hands and feet and placed in a horse's water trough until law enforcement arrived.1 \n# \nSteps to be Taken: Havenwood shall take the following steps to correct this issue: \n1. All staff will be re-trained in the proper use of restraints using AEGIS and all staff will be re-trained that physical (\"mechanical\") restraints may not be used at any time for any reason;"

        "text": "2. AEGIS trainings will continue and be increased as follows: \na. When a new employee is hired (this is currently protocol);   \nb.Yearly (this is currently protocol);   \nC。 Quarterly review/refresher trainings (this is not currently protocol and will be implemented); \n3. All independent contractors who are interacting with clients will be required to participate in all the above referenced AEGIS trainings and will execute a form indicating that they understand that physical (\"mechanical\") restraints may not be used at any time; \n4. All independent contractors, including the current equine contractor, shall be supervised by a representative of Program and/or Clinical at all times that the independent contractor is interacting with clients; \n5. The Program and/or Clinical representative shall be in control of all events occurring within an activity and shall have the authority to override any action taken or proposed to be taken by the independent contractor; \n6. All activities of an independent contractor shall be reviewed and approved by the appropriate treatment team before the same are implemented by the independent contractor; \n7. Any use of the “trough\" shall be discontinued and other appropriate and approved methods of teaching shall be implemented that comply with all rules and regulations of the Division of Licensing. \n# \nImmediately. \n# \nDuring the June 21st incident, 2 Havenwood staff allowed the use of physical restraint to be associated with punishment by placing the client in the horse water trough while zip-tied.2 \nSteps to be Taken: Havenwood shall take the following steps to correct this issue: \n1. All corrective action steps identified in response to Violation 1 shall also apply to Violation 2;   \n2. Additionally, proper employee discipline shall be applied to the two staff members involved;"

        "text": "3. Staff will also be trained that not only are they not to use physical restraints or punishments but that they are to prevent any independent contractor or other party from doing the same; \n4. The use of the trough for any reason shall be completely discontinued. \n# \nImmediately. \n# \nLinda Reeves (Clinical Director for Havenwood Academy) disclosed to the Office of Licensing and to Child Protective Services that for over the past 3 years she has allowed a horse water trough to be used for therapeutic discipline. This practice was never approved by the Office of Licensing and was not disclosed to the Office of Licensing, parents, and/or legal guardians of the consumers.3 \nSteps to be Taken: Havenwood shalltake the following steps to correct this issue: \n1. Linda Reeves shall review all rules and regulations of the Department of Licensing to ensure that she is aware of them and that the clinical program and overall program at Havenwood is and remains in compliance therewith;   \n2. Havenwood has recently retained the services of Ken Stettler as an advisor and auditor for the program. All clinical and program methodologies that involve “discipline” or \"client correction” shall be presented to Ms. Stettler and will not be implemented without notifying the Division of Licensing. \nDate Havenwood will achieve compliance with administrative rules and statutes: \nImmediately. \nVery Truly Yours, \nBlaine T. Hofeling CEO Havenwood Academy, Inc."
