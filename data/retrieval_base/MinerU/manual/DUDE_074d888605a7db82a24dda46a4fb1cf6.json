It is a seasonal crop and is highly perishable.  Fruits picked at proper stage of maturity can be kept in fresh state for a few days only, under normal conditions. It is, therefore, necessary that fruits should be preserved under proper conditions so as to prolong their life for human consumption and processing. \n0.3 Some guidelines for storing. of important yarieties of mangoes on scientific lines are given in this standard. It is hoped that these guide. lines stipulating the conditions to be maintained for various important varieties would prove helpful in increasing the shelf life and in preventing the wastage of fruits. Refrigerated storage of mangoes has not been found successful in our country. \n0.4 This Institution had earlier issued $\\mathbf{IS}:7252{\\circ}{\\cdot}1974^{\\star}$ which_prescribes definitions and information concerning measurement of physical factors in cold stores. \n# \n1.1 This standard describes methods for obtaining conditions for the successful storage of important varieties of mangoes ( Mangifera indica L. ) for table purposes and for processing them into various mango products. \n# \n# \n2.1.1 Mangoes should be picked at full maturity stage, just before they start ripening. In case of mangoes stored for later conversion into pickles, picking may be done just prior to the maturity stage as the fruits advanced to full maturity should not be used for pickling. The principal criteria which may be used to determine the optimal maturity stage for harvesting are as follows:"

        "text": "a) Firmness offruits  judged by fruit pressure tester. The fruit should be firm.   \nb)  Colour -- The stage when the colour of the skin just starts changing from deep green to light green. For pickles, green fruits are suitable as this maintains acidity.   \nc) The age of the fruit -— This is expressed as the number of days lapsed since full fowering.   \nd) Total soluble solids — measured by a refractometer at ${27}^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}$   \ne)  Acidity -- measured by titrating the mango juice with alkali.   \nf) Flesh colour   \ng) Specific gravity \n2.1.2 These criteria, may vary from variety to variety and for a single variety may vary from one region to another. Some of the physical and chemical characteristics of Alphanso variety are given below. These characteristics are also applicable to the Peter variety. \n# \na) Physical Characteristics \ni) Colour of the skin: Olive green with prominent white specks, white waxy bloom   \nii) Development of shoulders 1) Not developed at stem end: 2) Partly developed 3) _Well developed [The above (2) and (3) stages are preferred for harvesting]   \nii) Mass of individual Over ${\\bf200_{8}}$ fruit   \niv) Texture Firm   \nv)Flesh colour Cream \nb) Chemical Characteristics \ni) Total soluble solids, 8±1 percent   \nii) Acidity ( as malic acid ), ${3^{\\cdot}5\\pm\\:0^{\\cdot}2}$ percent"

        "text": "2.2 Quality Characteristics for Storage - The fruits to be stored should be clean, sound, free from blemishes, bruises or obvious physiologic disorders. It should also be free from traces of water and dirt and any visible signs of fungal or bacterial attack. \n# \na)  The practice of pre-ripening should be forbidden.   \nb) Fruits may be dipped in a wax emulsion containing fungicide of suitable strength and dried in a current of hot air, in order to delayripening. \n# \n2.4.1 The fruits should be stored as soon as possible after harvesting. since mature fruits start ripening just after harvesting. \n2.4.2 The package should be of such kind and arranged in the storage in a manner as to permit free circulation of air. The size of the package should be such as to avoid crushing and damaging of fruits at the bottom due to the weight of the fruits on top. \n2.4.3 The fruits should be packed into crates/cartons provided with lids or covers. Fruits may be packed in each case and the cases stacked on top of each other. The cases should not be packed to a height of more  than $7$ tiers. The container should be $550~\\mathrm{mm}$ long, $300~\\mathrm{min}$ wide and $210~\\mathrm{mm}$ high. The cartons should be provided with round holes for adequate ventilation. The box may have 6 holes each on top and bottom, and 3 holes each on broad sides ( breadthwise ） and 6 holes eachlengthwise. The holes maybe about $30~\\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter. The packages should be stored in shade, and in a ratproof room. \n2.4.4 The storage density between 250 to $300~\\mathrm{~kg}$ percubic_metreof usable space is considered suitable. The use of box pallets may, however, increase the storage density by approximately 10 percent. \n# \n3.1 Mangoes may be stored in well-ventilated premises at a _ temperature of $30\\pm\\mathbf{\\bar{2}^{\\circ}C}$ ..Relative humidity should be between 60 to 85 percent. \n3.1.1 Storage Life -- The fruits may be stored until edible ripe.
