        "text": "# \nThe X-30 National Aerospace Plane will be the biggest,fastest experimental $^{\\mathrm{11}}\\mathrm{X}$ plane\"ever.Shortly after the year 2000 it will takeoff,orbittheEarth,thencome back through the atmosphere and land on a runway. The goal: Give the U.S. space program themeans tobuild an airplanelike vehicle that can fly regularly into space. \nThe X-30 will differ from today's space vehicles in several ways: \nAIt will take off horizontally like an airplane,unliketheSpaceShuttleand other boosters that lift off straight up. That means the X-30 can be prepared for flight inside a large hangar and then rolled out to the runway. It won't need a special launch pad. \nAThe X-30 will have\"scramjet\" engines that burn a mix of hydrogen fuel carried on board and oxygen scooped up from the air as the plane flies at very high speeds.Today'srocketboostersmust carry alltheirfuel andoxidizeraboard at liftoff, a heavy weight that must be lifted from the ground. \nAThe Space Shuttle and other launchers usevery coldhydrogenfuel to cool only their engines. The X-30 will circulate hydrogen fuel through some of its structures tokeep them within temperature limits; its flight path is more shallow and theplanewill beheated for a longer time. \nAThe ${\\mathrm{X}}{\\cdot}30^{\\prime}s$ body will be shaped to produce \"lift,\"in the atmosphere to supportitsownweight.Thebottom ofthe ${\\mathrm{X}}{\\cdot}30^{\\prime}s$ nose also will compress and feed air to the scramjet engines. Thebottomof thetail iscurved to act as anozzlethatwill addpowerwhen the exhaust (mostly water vapor) leaves the engines. \nNASA, the Department of Defense and a team of America's leading aerospace companiesarenowworkingonadvanced designs in materials, engines and flight controls that will make theX-30 a reality. X-30 test flights are expected to start around theyear2000. \nThe National Aero-Space Plane program will: \nA Lower cost to send people and cargo into space. \nMaintain America'sworld-wide leadership in aviation and space. \nA Lead to new technology for everyday use. \nA Make new jobs and careers."
