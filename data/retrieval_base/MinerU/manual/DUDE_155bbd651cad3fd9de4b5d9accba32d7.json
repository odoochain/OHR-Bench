        "text": "# \nThis Indian Standard (First Revision), which is identical with ISO 6663 : 1995 'Garlic - Cold storage' issued by the International Organization for Standardization (Iso) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendation of the Processed Fruits and Vegetables Products Sectional Committee and approval of the Food and Agriculture Division Council. \nThis standard was first published in 1987 as dual number standard based on 1983 version of ISO 6663. With the revision of corresponding IsO Standard, this standard is also revised to align it with the latest ISO Standard. This revision incorporates among others, the following changes: \na) Normative reference clause has been added.   \nb) Requirements on harvesting, characteristics for storage, prestorage treatment and sizing have been modified.   \nc)  In method of storage, a space left between both below and above the stacks have been reduced to 0.5 m from 1.5 m earlier. \nIn the adopted standard certain terminology and conventions are not identical with those used in the Indian Standards. Attention is drawn specially to the following: \na)  Wherever the words International Standard' appear, referring to this standard, they should be read as 'Indian Standard'.   \nb)  Comma (,) has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards, the current practice is to use a point (.) as the decimal marker. \nIn this Indian Standard, the following International Standard is referred to. Read in its respective place the following: \nInternational Standard Indian Standard Degree of Correspondence ISO 2169 : 1981, Fruits and IS 7252 : 1974 Guide for testing of physi-  Related vegetables —— Physical conditions in cal conditions in cold stores cold stores -- Definitions and measurement"

        "text": "# \n# \nThis International Standard gives guidance on conditions for cold storage for the successful keeping of garlic (Allium sativum Linnaeus) intended for consumption in the fresh state. \n# \nThe following standard contains provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this International Standard. At the time of publication, the edition indicated was valid. Ail standards are subject to revision, and parties to agreements based on this international Standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent edition of the standard indicated below. Members of IEC and ISO maintain registers of currently valid International Standards. \nISO 2169:1981, Fruits and  vegetables --  Physical conditions in cold stores — Definitions and measurement. \n# \n# \nGarlic intended for storage should be harvested when the tips or leaves begin to turn yellow, the neck tissue of the bulb begins to soften, and the mass of the bulb no longer increases. The bulbs shouid be well formed and physiologically at rest. The protective exterior scale should be dry and have a characteristic colour. \nHarvesting should be carried out during dry weather over a short period of time. \n# \nOnly those varieties (cultivars) of garlic suitable for long-term keeping should be stored. Garlic intended for cold storage should be of good commercial quality. It should be: \n\n-- clean, dry and whole;   \n-- firm, ripe but not sprouting;   \n-- healthy with a dry exterior scale;   \n- free from all field and store pests (nematodes and mites);   \n- free from sun or frost damage; and   \n- free of any foreign odour or taste. \n# \nAfter harvesting, the garlic shouid be dried (cured). This operation begins in the fields and continues in the store rooms at temperatures of $20~^{\\circ}C$ to $30~^{\\circ}C$ for 8 or 10 days, or at temperatures of $35^{\\circ}C$ to $40~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for $1/2$ to 1 day. with $60\\%$ or $75\\%$ relative humidity. \nDisinfection  of  the  bulbs  with'  methyl  bromide (bromomethane) is permissible only for garlic to be used for seed. \nThe storage life of garlic can be extended by using treatment with maleic hydrazide or other sprout inhibitors before harvesting. This treatment is effective for the control of sprouting and weight losses. \n# \nSizing of garlic buibs should be carried out according to their diameters. The minimum diameter is $45\\mathrm{mm}$ for garlic in the Extra Class, and $30m m$ for garlic in Classes I and Il. The differences in diameters of bulbs which are in the same package should not exceed $2,5\\mathrm{~mm}$"

The stores should be filled within a short period of time. \n# \nSacks should be filled in a manner that ensures circulation of air. Box pallets or sacks on post pallets may be stacked up to five or six high. For boxes which can be stored on pallets, stacking may be up to eight or nine high, leaving spaces to aliow the circulation of air in all directions. \nA space of about $0,5m$ should be left both below and above the stacks. \n# \nFor measurement of the physical quantities affecting storage, see ISO 2169. \n# \nGarlic should be stored at ${\\circ\\circ\\mathsf C}$ and temperature variations shouid not exceed $\\pm0.5\\Upsilon$ \n# \nDuring storage the relative humidity of the air should bemaintainedbetween $65\\%$ and $75\\%$ \n# \nAir should be circulated constantly to ensure a homo geneous temperature. \n# \nThe storage life varies with the variety (cultivar) and method of cultivation and ranges from 130 to 220 days. The condition of the stored product should be checked every 7 to 10 days. \n# \nWhen removed from cold store, garlic should be gradually rewarmed to avoid condensation forming on the surface of the product. \nIf required, garlic should be sorted according to quality."
