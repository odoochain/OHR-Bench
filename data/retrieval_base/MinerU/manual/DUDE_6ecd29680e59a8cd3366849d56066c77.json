The uploader is a lightweight Java desktop application which allows you to choose the {{Artwork}}, {{Photograph}} or {{Information}} Commons templates – and then tweak them according to your needs, choosing only the fields that are needed, pre-filling the fields in which the information stays the same for one batch upload (e.g. the Institution or License field) and simplifying the process of uploading a batch of files from one source. \n# \nChoose a Commons template: {{Artwork}}, {{Information}}, {{Photograph}}, then   \nchoose needed, specific description fields from that template   \nUpload faster (all repetitive information needs only to be copied across)   \nInput your own wikicode in any field   \nPreview the completed file description before uploading \n# \nEasy to use   \nDetailed descriptions of files ensure they can be found and reused Upload files from any folder on a PC   \nCreate only descriptions and  templates relevant to your institution \n# \n• Prepare a folder containing the files to upload   \n• Download Pattypan and run the pattypan.jar file   \n• Click Generate spreadsheet and navigate to a folder containing the files you would like to upload Select the fields to include in the file descriptions (e.g. date, dimensions, institution, source, etc.)   \n• Open and edit the resulting spreadsheet, then save   \n• Validate and upload: preview file descriptions and correct any errors Login and upload! \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{((Artwork)) Template documentation Select fields youfindnecessaryby using radio buttons below.If you chooseYes,you can pre-populate fields using text} \\\\\nfield.If you chooseConst\"，value from text field willbe applied to allfiles without possibility to change it per file.
