CARTER, J.O. CuRTIS, and K.H.HINcHCLIFF of the Department of Agriculutural Engineering) \n# \nThe plans that you will find listed on the following pages are generally recommended for Illinois. They have been tested by wide use. The small charge made for each plan is only enough to cover the cost of printing and handling. \nThe plans in this book were selected from a large number prepared by the University of Illinois,the U. S. Department of Agriculture,and the Midwest Plan Service. The Midwest Plan Service is a cooperative program of the states in the North-Central region,of which Illinois is a part.Plans are developed cooperatively， are published as Midwest plans,and are then distributed by the individual states.In the future an increasing number of the plans distributed by the University of Illinois College of Agriculture will be Midwest plans.Illinois will continue,however,to develop new designs and to prepare plans to meetneeds not otherwise satisfied. \nThese plans and planning aids are one result of the research work carried on by the Departmentof Agricultural Engineering in a wide variety of subjects connected with farm buildings and rural housing.Much of this research is conducted through cooperative projects with other departments,other state experiment stations, and the U.S.Department of Agriculture. \nFarm and home advisers are ready to help in selecting plans, placing orders,or obtaining information.Many materials dealers, contractors,and vocational-agriculture teachers are also familiar with these plans and can give advice about them. \nFarm-building planning at the University of Illinois College of Agriculture is concerned with more than just the preparation and distribution of plans. Some of the other activities include county or communitymeetings atwhich extension specialists discuss farmbuilding problems, short courses and conferences,and the distribution of publications on a variety of subjects relating to building. Personal planning isnota partof the service but questions are answered by correspondence,visitorstalkover problemswith staff members,and some demonstration planning is carried on. \n# \nPlans.

        "text": "# \nA long-time program for building construction, maintenance,and remodeling,projected the same way that a crop or livestock program is projected, will keep you from making expensive mistakes in your building improvements. Such a program is the only sound basis for such decisions as whether to make minor repairs on an old building so that it can be used a few more years, make major repairs and alterations on an existing building so that it will serve many more years, or build a new building. \nIf you decide on a new building, you need to give careful consideration to several questions before you are ready to build. What is the best way to arrange the space in the building? How large should it be? What building materials ought to be used? How much ought you to spend? Where should you locate it? \nStart with a good plan. Those that you find in this book will help you make a good choice, whatever building you have in mind. They have been planned and designed in line with the recommendations of the College of Agriculture. The building types,measurements, arrangements,and constructions they show have been proved by research and experience.Even though no one of the plans satisfies your building needs in every detail, the plans can be used as a guide to good construction and effective arrangement. \nThe special requirements and problems of different farm enterprises have been considered in developing these plans. For example, sanitation has been emphasized in designing structures for use in hog production. Shelters and equipment for beef cattle aim for effcient handling of the animals. Dairy barns and milkhouses meet the requirements for the production of grade A milk. Cribs and bins have been designed for safe storage and conditioning. \nIn deciding on a plan, you will normally have to choose between two or more systems of housing.For example,you will need to decide whether you prefer the loose housing barn for your dairy cattle or the stanchion barn,whether you will use individual houses or a central house for swine farrowing,whether you want ground level or loft storage for hay, and whether you will have earcorn cribs or shelled-corn bins. \nFigure building size and capacity carefully. Adjust to the amount of crops,livestock,and equipment youwill store or house.Mostof the plans in this book are for buildings of a definite size,but in the exact size shown they would meet the needs of only a few farms. The size can be varied to meet the needs of the individual farm; the plans will show good arrangements and standard methods of construction. Ordinarily farm buildings can best be varied in size by changing the length without affecting width,height,or type ofconstruction. \nChoose a suitable building material. Most of the plans are adaptable enough that materials other than those shown on the plans can be used. Roofing materials are usually not indicated, so their choice is left entirely up to the builder. Prefabricated parts or fully prefabricated buildings can be used in place of ordinary construction; the plans can then be used merely as a guide to effective space arrangement. \nBalance amount spent against expected return. Buildings must pay out in terms of their value for shelter, storage, labor saved, and improved quality of products.You normally cannot justify elaborate buildings where low-cost buildings —pole frames, open sheds, or straw shelters will serve the purpose. You may justify a higher investment,however,where increased returns can be expected from better-quality buildings. \nHigh costs of construction can best be offset by carefully planning each step of the job to insure that you get the maximum improvement for each dollar spent. There is no magic way to cut down building costs. You can, however, make a sizable reduction in the cash outlay by using as much of your own labor as possible. Using materials already on the farm or available locally will alsohelp. \nLocate the building wisely. A good location may mean the difference between convenience and efficiency on one hand and dissatisfaction on the other. Give careful consideration to such things as sheltered yards, windbreaks, drainage, access from driveways, and distances between buildings."

        "text": "# \nThe most critical time in a hog's life is from birth until it reaches a weight of about 75 pounds. During this period it needs a carefully planned house and protective equipment. \nSome of themore important features of a good hog-housing system are: \nEnough space for the animals \nProtection from cold, wind,rain,and snow, and from too much summer sunshine \nGuard rails and other equipment and constructions thatwill protect the animals \nTemperatures and moisture conditions in the house that help to keep the animals healthy and comfortable \nEasy to keep sanitary \nOpportunity to feed and handle the animalswith a minimum of the operator's time \nThe current interest in winter and early spring farrowing and in houses for year-round (hatchery)production emphasizes the central hog house for the larger enterprises. Central houses help to save labor by centering the work in one building, but to meet present needs such houses have to be provided with supplementary heat,heat lamps, insulation,and facilities for sanitation.New designs are being studied and plans will be made available that will incorporate these features. \nThree types of movable houses are in good demand: (1) individual houses, such as Plans 428 and 262 shown on page 13;(2) multi-unit houses with room for 2, 3, or 4 pens; and (3) divided 3-unit houses which can be brought together to form 6-pen houses with a service alley in the center (Plan 507,page 13,illustrated below). \nReady-made movable hog houses and selffeeders can be bought from materials dealers and manufacturers.It may bemore practicable to buy these prefabricated items than to make them on thefarm. \nA number of Midwest plans for structures which serve as grain storages can be converted readily to farrowing houses or self-feeders (see page 7).They are Plan 72626 (15),two-unit house or 300-bushel bin;Plan 72627 $(30\\phi$ );central farrowing house or 3,400-bushel bin;Plan 77613 $\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{15}}\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ self-feeder and short-time storage; Plan77614 $(\\boldsymbol{{1}}\\boldsymbol{{5}}\\boldsymbol{{\\phi}})$ ,self-feeder or 400-bushel bin; and Plan77615 $.30\\phi$ ),self-feeder,drier,orbin for 550bushels of ear corn or1,100 bushelsof shelled corn."

        "text": "# \nA farm poultry enterprise usually needs houses for growing stock (fryers, broilers, or replacements);laying houses; and equipment such as nests,roosts, feeders,and waterers. The houses must be carefully designed,especially in the colder regions,to protect the birds from rain and snow, cold wind, dampness, extreme changes in temperature,low temperature,and high summer temperatures. \nHouses for growing stock. For farm flocks the common type of house for young chicks or growing stock is a single-unit brooder house from $10\\mathrm{~x~}12$ feetto $12\\mathrm{~x~}14$ feetfor200to300baby chicks. Single-unit houses can be bought prefabricated so that they come to the farm ready touse. \nLaying houses. Laying houses for farm-size focks may be either uninsulated,partly insulated with a straw loft and ventilated attic,or tightly built,fully insulated houses with controlled ventilation. \nThe straw-loft house is commonly recommended for Illinois. The straw fill lets moisture outand permits air to circulate.Withventilated space above the straw and with adjustable windows,ventilation isreasonably good and a special ventilating system isnot needed.In the coldest parts of Illinois,fully insulated houses with ventilating systems will maintain better conditions inside,but they are more expensive.Uninsulated houses are built with only one layer of wood or other material for siding and have a low roof without a loft. They are generally used in the southern partofIllinois. \n\nLaying houses are planned on the basis of about3to4 square feetof foor areaper bird, depending on the breed. Less space results in overcrowding.A house 20 feet square will take care of 100 to 135hens and is sometimes called a unithouse. \nEquipment. When considering the equipment for a laying house, it is well to plan for: \n8 to 10 inches of roosting space per bird   \none open nest for each 5 or 6hens or one trap nestforeach3or4hens   \nabout1 foot ofmash-hopper feeding space for every5hens   \nan ample water supply-preferably running water with automatic controls and protection against freezing   \nrodent-proof feed storage—metal cans or barrels,or in a large house a separate feed room   \ntwo40-to60-wattlightswithrefectorsoverthe feed hoppers for each 20-foot length of pen"

        "text": "# \nPlanning of farm buildings should begin with a study of the farmstead so that each new building can be located to best advantage and the arrangement of buildings, driveway, yards, and plantings can be effective and attractive. A longtime plan is needed as a guide. Each improvement as it is added can then be located to fit into the long-timeplan. \nThe general principles of farm planning are the same formostfarmsteads even though the details vary because of differences between farms. The following suggestions apply to most farmsteads in Illinois. \nLocate each new building on elevated ground so that surface water will drain away from it. If necessary, build the foor above the ground line and grade the ground to get the right slope. \nTry to group buildings according to the production program; place animal shelters, hay storage, grain and feed supplies, and feeding foors or milk rooms in compact, labor-saving units. Keep machinery-storage and shop buildings away from barns tominimize danger from fire,butplace them so it will be easy to get machinery in and out. \nLocate a new dwelling 80 to 100 feet from the road with the garage near the house. Poultry buildings may be reasonably close to the house 100feet or even less. \n\nPlan a service court or farmyard so that you will not have to go through gates to reach the principal buildings. Make the court large enough for trucks, tractors, and farm machinery to be handled and turned easily. This means the yard should be at least 80 feet across the narrow width. \nProtect feedlots, pens, and yards by locating them to the south or south and east of the barns and other shelters. This arrangement will cut off cold winds in winter, get as much sunlight as possible in the lots, and reduce the danger of icy yards. \nLocate windbreaks north and west of the buildings. Keep the area reasonably open to the south and southwest. Avoid locating hog lots and cattle yards southwest of the dwelling. \nUsually provide only one all-weather driveway from the road into the farmstead.Provide space for parking cars. Make it easy to get to the front and back doors of the house, to the garage, and to the farm buildings from the driveway. \nPlan for water supply and electric service to all principal buildings and for septic-tank sewage disposal from the dwelling. \nFARMSTEAD PLANNING AID. Plan459 $(60\\phi)$ .A set of seven farm-building models. These models can be used to study farmstead arrangement and 1ocation of buildings.
