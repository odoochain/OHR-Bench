        "text": "# \nIt's hard to tell that George \nBrown is one of the largest colleges in Ontario.That's because College activity is divided between 13 locations in downtown Toronto. There are five main campuses,each reflecting a different aspect of the city. For exact locations and addresses,look at the map on the back panel. \n# \nOur largest campus is across the streetfrom the Toronto landmark of the same name built by Sir Henry Pellatt early in this century. Its five buildings house most of our technology and trade programs.Students in dental, ceramics, jewellery,andfitness instructor programs study here too. \n\n# \nLocated a fewblocks east of the centre of Canadian business the intersection of King and Bay Streets this campus is where students in business,graphic arts,dance,drama, nursing and electrical programs study. Named after the nearby St.James Cathedral, the main building is of historical interest itself. Built as a bakery in \n1874,it has been completely renovated for College use. \n# \nFruit and fabric vie for sidewalk space around this campus near the intersection of College and Spadina.Fashion students are just steps away from Spadina Avenue,the traditional centre of clothing manufacturing,and our hospitality students are right next door to the Kensington food market with its colour, noise and bargains. \n\n# \nStudents in community service and post-diploma nursing programs are surrounded by the Toronto medical establishment at this campus.Toronto General,The Hospital for Sick Children, Mount Sinai and \nmany other medical and social service institutions are steps away from ourbuilding near Queen’s Park \nLocated on cosmopolitan College Street,nearBathurst Street this campus is home to the College's language training programs,ncluding a large English as a Second Language program."
