        "text": "# \nThe National Health & Medical Research Council (2008) define an AEFI as “… an unwanted or unexpected event occurring after the administration of vaccine(s). Such an event may be caused by the vaccine(s) or may occur by chance after vaccination (ie. it would have occurred regardless of vaccination).” \nThe Children’s Hospital at Westmead in partnership with the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance now has over 15 years of experience in the management and assessment of children and adolescents who have either experienced an AEFI or are at increased risk of developing an AEFI because of an underlying medical condition. \nThe clinic is staffed by experienced doctors and nurses whose speciality is immunisation. \nThe setting of the clinic within the hospital allows us to offer vaccination under close supervision on a number of different levels: \n1. Outpatient Department   \n2. Day stay ward   \n3. Inpatient stay \n# \n• Assessment and management of a child or adolescent who has experienced an AEFI   \n• In depth discussion with parents who have   \nconcerns about vaccines, side effects and possible adverse events   \n• Administration of vaccines under close supervision, if appropriate   \n• Personalised follow up by telephone call after vaccination   \n• Outline of options for future vaccination schedule (may differ from the standard schedule depending on the nature of the AEFI) \n# \n• You and your child will see a doctor who specialises in immunisation • The doctor will examine your child, take the medical history, discuss your concerns and make a plan with you for future vaccinations if appropriate • Your child may be vaccinated on the day after the consultation by the specialist nurse, may be asked to return at a later date, or may need to be admitted to hospital for closer supervision \n# \n• No. Attendance at the clinic is free for Medicare card holders \n# \n• Obtain a referral letter from your local doctor   \n• Contact Kath Cannings, Immunisation Adverse Events Clinical Nurse Consultant (details overleaf) \n# \n• The referral from your local doctor   \n• Your child’s Medicare card   \n• Your child’s Personal Health Record (“Blue   \nBook”) \n\nthink. kids."
