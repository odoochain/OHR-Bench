        "text": "# \n# \n0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution on 31 July 1975, after the draft finalized by the Fruits and Vegetables Sectional Committee had been approved by the Agricultural and Food Products Division Council. \n0.2 To ensure fuller utilization of perishable foodstuffs such as fruits and vegetables it is necessary that they should be preserved under conditions so as to maintain their fitness for human consumption over a period of time. Refrigeration is one of the important means to preserve these foodstuffs. For cold storage of various fruits and vegetables on scientific lines, a series of Indian Standard guides based on corresponding ISO Recommendations are being issued. It is hoped that these guides stipulating the conditions to be maintained for different fruits and vegetables would prove to be helpful in better administration of cold storages and in preventing avoidable wastage of fruits. \n0.3 In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been drawnfrom $\\mathbf{I}\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}\\mathbf{O}/\\mathbf{R}$ 1134-1968 ‘Guide to cold storage of pears' issued by the International Organization for Standardization. \n0.4 This Institution had earlier issued IS : $7252{\\cdot}1974^{*}$ which_prescribes definitions and information concerning measurement of physical factors in coldstores. \n# \n1.1 This standard describes methods for obtaining conditions for the successful storage of pears. \n# \n# \n2.1.1 The practical criteria of maturity most frequently used for defining the best time for harvesting may be as given below : \na) The basic colour of the outer skin; \nNoTE -- The basic ground colour should be distinguished from the red anthocyanin pigmentation, the intensity and extent of which vary according to the variety and, to some extent,with the exposure to sunlight."

It should be clean and dry. \n2.3 Putting into Storage--The fruit should be put into the cold store as soon as possible after harvesting preferably after precooling. The temperature of the fruit should be lowered to a value suitable for the variety within four days. For achieving this, large quantities of cold air should be circulated in the cold storage room. \n2.4 Method of Storage -- The fruit should be handled with care. The packages should allow free circulation of air. Storage densities. of about $\\mathbf{\\dot{2}00~k g}$ per cubic metre of usable space are recommended. \n2.4.1 When the fruits are stored in pellets, the storage density may be increased by 10 to 20 percent. \n# \n# \n3.1.1 Pears should be kept at as low a temperature as possible, subject only to avoiding the risk of freezing. In general, the best results are obtainedat $-1\\i_{0}+\\o{0^{\\cdot}5^{\\circ}}\\mathrm{C}$ \n3.1.2 A difference of $1^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}$ in storage temperature has a profound effect on the time for which the pears can be kept. It has been shown that during cold storage the freezing point of the fruit falls slightly."
