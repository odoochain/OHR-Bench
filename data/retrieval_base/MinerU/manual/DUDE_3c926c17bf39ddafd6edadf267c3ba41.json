You gamble on a parts failure and a service call back when you use anything but Sears parts and Sears quality service. \nSears parts are made to the original specifications to fit right ... function better ...last longer. Remember ... when your Kenmore needs service to specify Sears service which provides: \nPrompt service whenever you need it.   \nExpert service by factory trained technicians.   \n·Guaranteed Factory Specification Parts especially made for your Kenmore. \n# \n# \nYour new KENMORE Appliance carries a most liberal service and parts guarantee.
