Appropriate consideration of equipment nameplate ratings should be used when addressing this concern. \nReliable Earthing- Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should be maintained. \nParticular attention should be given to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit (e.g. use of power strips). \n# \nCaution: ESD can damage drives, boards, and other parts.
