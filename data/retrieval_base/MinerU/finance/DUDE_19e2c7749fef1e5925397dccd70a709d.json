        "text": "# \nItems Included by the Senate and House \n1. Receipt of Federal and Private Funds. Specifies that Federal and private funds received by the State for use of a college or university are appropriated for the purposes for which they are received.

Governor included new language that would limit payments made to universities under this program to a per-credit payment that does not exceed three times the average community college in-district tuition rate.

Governor reduced the allowable tuition increase under this section from $3.8\\%$ or $\\$490$ to $3.2\\%$ or $\\$427$ . This change reflects a new policy of setting the tuition restraint cap at the rate of inflation plus $1.0\\%$ , whereas the policy in previous years had been twice the rate of inflation. House concurred with the Governor. Senate and Conference maintained the current policy, which resulted in a tuition cap of $4.4\\%$ or $\\$587$ . (Sec. 265) \n12. Tuition Restraint - Exceeding Limit. Governor removed language that restricts a university that exceeds the rate cap from receiving a capital outlay planning or construction authorization, as well as language that specifies that the Legislature may adjust the appropriation to any university that exceeds the rate cap.

The fourth column is the most recent data on the cost for each university to provide waivers to students who qualify for the ITW. In FY 1996-97, the Legislature rolled separately-identified ITW amounts for each university into that university's operations line item.  Each year, this amount has been tracked and adjusted for across-the-board increases or decreases in university operating appropriations; this amount is shown in the second column.  The third column is the amount that must be added to the amount already built in to each university's operations appropriation to produce the number in the fourth column."
