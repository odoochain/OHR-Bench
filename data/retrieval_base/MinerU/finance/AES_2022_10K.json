        "text": "Incorporated in 1981, AES is a global energy company accelerating the future of energy. Together with our many stakeholders, we are improving lives by delivering the greener, smarter energy solutions the world needs. Our diverse workforce is committed to continuous innovation and operational excellence, while partnering with our customers on their strategic energy transitions and continuing to meet their energy needs today. \n\n# \nAES is an industry leader in developing and operating the solutions that will enable the transition to zero and low-carbon sources of energy nd achievement of the Paris Agreement's goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. \nToday we see an enormous business opportunity from the once-in-a-lifetime transformation of the electricity sector driven by decarbonization, electrification, and digitalization. There is a substantial need for more renewable energy as well as an opportunity for innovation to develop new products and solutions that help customers accomplish their individual decarbonization goals. \nThe focus of our strategy continues to be on partnering with large companies that are looking to transition to carbon-free sources of lectricity. As an indication of our success, in 2022 we were recognized by BNEF as the #1 global clean energy developer for corporations. \nIn 2022, we signed long-term contracts for 5.2 GW of renewable power, bringing our backlog of projects — those with signed contracts, b which are not yet in operation — to 12.2 GW. Our backlog serves as the core component of future growth. \nCentral to our renewables growth strategy is a focus on customer collaboration and co-creation, which helps us develop unique solutions tailored to a specific customer's needs. This approach not only contributes to customer satisfaction and repeat business, but it also allows AES to work with key customers on a bilateral basis rather than just through participation in bid processes. \nThis approach has led to the co-creation of several first-of-its-kind industry innovations, including agreements to supply 24/7 carbon-free energy for global data center companies. Our unique capabilities in developing tailored energy solutions, enabled us to partner with Air Products to announce our plans to develop, build, own, and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility to date in the United States. \nWe are also working with some of the world's largest mining companies in their transition to renewable energy in South America, essentially educing the emissions of major supply chains.

At AES Indiana, for example, we are working to retire its remaining coal generation by the end of 2025, while adding new renewables and natural gas to the grid. \nOur renewable growth strategy includes taking steps to ensure and enable growth in future years. We massively expanded our pipeline of development projects, which grew from 55 GW in January 2022 to 64 GW as of the end of 2022, both through acquisitions and increased investment in development activities, such as securing land or advancing permitting and interconnection processes. For our projects in latestage development, we worked to secure supplier arrangements to avoid any potential delays in relation to industry shortages, aided by our scale, supplier relationships, and advanced planning measures. A substantial portion of our expected capital expenditures through 2025 will be related to the development of renewable projects. \nWe are also developing and incubating new technologies that add value today and will drive our business in the future. We understand that the energy industry is changing rapidly, and aim to proactively seek solutions that will give us a continued competitive advantage. At the core of our innovation strategy is AES Next, our business and technology incubator. AES Next works to identify new and innovative technologies and business opportunities that provide or support leading-edge greener energy solutions. \n# \n• We signed 5,153 MW of renewables and energy storage under long-term PPAs, including 2,553 MW of solar, wind and energy storage in the United States.   \n• We completed the construction or acquisition of operating projects totaling 1,943 MW in the United States, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Chile and Colombia, primarily wind, solar and energy storage.   \n• Our backlog, which includes projects with signed contracts, but which are not yet operational, is now 12,179 MW, consisting of: ◦ 5,453 MW under construction; and ◦ 6,726 MW with signed PPAs, but that are not yet under construction.   \n• We announced a partnership with Air Products to develop, build, own and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility to date in the United States. ◦ Includes approximately 1.4 GW of wind and solar generation, along with electrolyzer capacity capable of producing over 200 metric tons per day (MT/D) of green hydrogen.   \n• The Company expects to announce certain internal management changes which will result in modifications to its financial reporting segments. \n# \n# \nWe currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 32,326 MW, including generation from our integrated utility, AES Indiana. Our eneration fleet is diversified by fuel type. See discussion below under Fuel Costs. \nPerformance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, availability of generation capacity to meet contracted sales, fuel costs, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition. The financial performance of our renewables business is also impacted by our ability to complete construction projects and earn U.S. renewable tax credits. \nContract Sales — Most of our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts (\"contract sales\") or under shortterm agreements in competitive markets (\"short-term sales\"). Our medium-term contract sales have terms of two to five years, while our longterm contracts have terms of more than five years. \nContracts requiring fuel to generate energy, such as natural gas or coal, are structured to recover variable costs, including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel or energy supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion below under Fuel Costs).

        "text": "ontracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing. \nCertain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses, debt service, and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payments be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. \nContracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payment are structured based on long-term spot prices with some negotiated pass-through costs, allowing us to recover expected fixed and variable costs as well as provide a return on investment. \nThese contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. We generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the Short-Term Sales section below. \nThus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and, as applicable, fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract. \nShort-Term Sales — Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of less than two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves. \nMany of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market. \nPlant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs. \nFuel Costs — For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include indexation for fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants. \nIn short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk please see Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Form 10-K. \n$46\\%$ of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by renewables, including hydro, solar, wind, energy storage, biomass and landfi gas, which do not have significant fuel costs."

        "text": "$32\\%$ of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natural gas. With the exception of our plants in the Dominican Republic and Panama, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. \n$20\\%$ of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our coal-fired plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants, and at our plant in Puerto Rico, we source coal from a mix of sources from the international market and in the local jurisdictions. To the extent possible, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement. \n$2\\%$ of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes pet coke, diesel or oil for fuel. We source oil and diesel locally at prices linked to nternational markets. We largely source pet coke from Mexico and the U.S. \nSeasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power. \nFixed-Cost Management — In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance. \nCompetition — For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. Fo short-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules. \n# \nOur utility businesses consist of AES Indiana and AES Ohio in the U.S. and four utilities in El Salvador. AES' six utility businesses distribute power to 2.6 million customers and AES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation capacity totaling 3,495 MW. \nAES Indiana, our fully integrated utility, and AES Ohio, our transmission and distribution regulated utility, operate as the sole distributors of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. AES Indiana owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. AES Ohio owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to transmit and distribute electricity. At our distribution business in El Salvador, we face limited competition due to significant barriers to enter the market. According to El Salvador's regulation, large regulated customers have the option of becoming unregulated users and requesting service directly from generation or commercialization agents. \nIn general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity and reliability of service. Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nRegulated Rate of Return and Tariff — In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses ar subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (\"tariffs\") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers fo electricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet. \nOur utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator, within the framework of applicable local laws, and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers. \nThe tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the"

        "text": "customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract directly with the utility or with other retail energy suppliers and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system. \nThe regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage uncollectible amounts, quality of service and technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns. \nSeasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity — Our utility businesses are generally affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels and patterns. Retail sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are also affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers. \nReliability of Service — Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those standards may be explicit, with defined performance incentives or penalties, or implicit, where the utility must operate to meet customer and/or regulator expectations. \n# \nWe develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing plants retrofitted in response to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is in key growth markets, where we can leverage our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses by adding renewable energy. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the strategic fit, project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment. \nIn some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners, when it is commercially attractive. We typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards. \n# \nThe segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the businesses internally and is mainly organized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. \nWe are organized into four market-oriented SBUs: US and Utilities (United States, Puerto Rico and El Salvador); South America (Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil); MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia) — which are led by our SBU Presidents. We have two lines of business: generation and utilities. Each of our SBUs participates in our first business line, generation, in which we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our US and Utilities SBU participates in our second business line, utilities, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market. \nWe measure the operating performance of our SBUs using Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure. The Adjusted PTC by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2022 is shown below. The percentages for Adjusted PTC are the contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by SBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for reconciliation and definitions of Adjusted PTC."

        "text": "The following map illustrates the locations of our US and Utilities facilities: \n# \n\n# \nBusiness Description — IPALCO is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is AES Indiana. AES Indiana is an integrated utility that is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Indiana has an exclusive right to provide electric service to the customers in its service area, covering about 528 square miles with an estimated population of approximately 971,000 people. AES Indiana owns and operates four generating stations, all within the state of Indiana. AES Indiana’s largest generating station, Petersburg, is coal-fired. AES Indiana retired 230 MW Petersburg Unit 1 on May 31, 2021 and has plans to retire 415 MW Petersburg Unit 2 in 2023, which would result in 630 MW of total retired economic capacity at this station. AES Indiana plans to convert the remaining two coal units at Petersburg to natural gas by the end of 2025 (see Integrated Resource Plan below). The second largest station, Harding Street, uses natural gas and fuel oil to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana operates a 20 MW battery-based energy storage unit at this location, which provides frequency response. The third station, Eagle Valley, is a CCGT natural gas plant. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana helps meet its customers' energy needs with long-term contracts for the purchase of 300 MW of wind-generated electricity and 94 MW of solar-generated electricity. In July 2021, AES Indiana executed an agreement to acquire a 250 MW solar and 180 MWh energy storage facility (the \"Petersburg Solar Project\"). As amended in October 2022 and subject to IURC approval, the Petersburg Solar Project is now expected to be completed in 2025. In December 2021, AES Indiana completed the acquisition of Hardy Hills Solar Energy LLC, including the development of a 195 MW solar project (the \"Hardy Hills Solar Project\"). As amended in December 2022 and subject to IURC approval, the Hardy Hills Solar Project is now expected to be completed in 2024. \nKey Financial Drivers — AES Indiana's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition, AES Indiana's financial results are likely to be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to: \nregulatory outcomes and impacts;"

        "page_idx": 17,
        "text": "the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulation; and timely recovery of capital expenditures. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — AES Indiana is subject to comprehensive regulation by the IURC with respect to its services and facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of long-term securities, and certain other matters. The regulatory authority of the IURC over AES Indiana's business is typical of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for electric service provided by AES Indiana. The IURC considers all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used and useful to providing service to customers. \nAES Indiana's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and approved charges. In addition, AES Indiana's rates include various adjustment mechanisms, including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet AES Indiana's retail load requirements, referred to as the Fuel Adjustment Charge, (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including a return, (iii) a rider to reflect changes in ongoing RTO costs, (iv) riders for passing through to customers wholesale sales margins and capacity sales above and below established annual benchmarks, (v) a rider for a return on, and of, investments for eligible TDSIC improvements, and (vi) a rider for cost recovery, lost margin recoveries and performance incentives from AES Indiana's demand side management energy efficiency programs. Each of these tariff rate components function somewhat independently of one another, but the overall structure of AES Indiana's rates is subject to review at the time of any review of AES Indiana's basic rates and charges. Additionally, AES Indiana's rider recoveries are reviewed through recurring filings. \nOn October 31, 2018, the IURC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement agreement to increase AES Indiana's annual revenues by $\\$44$ million, or $3\\%$ (the \"2018 Base Rate Order\"). This revenue increase primarily includes recovery through rates of costs associated with the CCGT at Eagle Valley, completed in the first half of 2018, and other construction projects. New base rates and charges became effective on December 5, 2018. The 2018 Base Rate Order was AES Indiana's most recent base rate order and also provided customers with approximately $\\$50$ million in benefits through a rate adjustment mechanism over a two-year period. \nAES Indiana is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. MISO dispatches generation assets in economic order considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. AES Indiana offers electricity in the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. \nDevelopment Strategy — AES Indiana's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and compliance with environmental regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance. \nSenate Enrolled Act 560, the Transmission, Distribution, and Storage System Improvement Charge (\"TDSIC\") statute, provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement electric and gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a public utility undertakes for the purposes of safety, reliability, system modernization, or economic development. Provisions of the TDSIC statute require that requests for recovery include a plan of at least five years and not more than seven for eligible investments. Once a plan is approved by the IURC, eighty percent of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, referred to as a TDSIC mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on, and of, the investment, including AFUDC, post-in-service carrying charges, operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in the public utility’s next base rate case. The TDSIC mechanism is capped at an annual increase of two percent of total retail revenues. \nOn March 4, 2020, the IURC issued an order approving the projects in AES Indiana's seven-year TDSIC Plan for eligible transmission, distribution, and storage system improvements totaling $\\$1.2$ billion from 2020 through 2026. Beginning in June 2020, AES Indiana files an annual TDSIC rate adjustment for a return on, and of, investments through March 31 with rates requested to be effective each November. Annual TDSIC plan update filings are required to be staggered by six months as ordered by the IURC and are filed each December. The total amount of AES Indiana’s equipment approved for TDSIC recovery as of December 31, 2022 was $\\$324$ million. \nIntegrated Resource Plan — In December 2022, AES Indiana filed its Integrated Resource Plan (\"IRP\"), which describes AES Indiana's Preferred Resource Portfolio for meeting generation capacity needs for serving AES Indiana's retail customers over the next several years. The Preferred Resource Portfolio is AES Indiana's reasonable least cost option and provides a cleaner and more diverse generation mix for customers. The 2022 IRP"

AES Indiana has not yet filed for the necessary regulatory approvals from the IURC to convert Petersburg units 3 and 4, however, AES Indiana expects to do so at the appropriate time. Additionally, AES Indiana plans to add up to 1,300 MW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage by 2027. As new technologies, such as green hydrogen, small modular reactors and carbon capture are developed and cost effective, we will evaluate them in the future planning processes \nAES Indiana's 2019 IRP included the retirement of 230 MW Petersburg Unit 1 on May 31, 2021 and plans to retire 415 MW Petersburg Unit 2 in 2023. In November 2021, AES Indiana received approval from the IURC for approvals and cost recovery associated with the Petersburg retirements, which includes: (1) AES Indiana's creation of regulatory assets for the net book value of Petersburg units 1 and 2 upon retirement; (2) a method for amortization of the regulatory assets; and (3) recovery of the regulatory assets through ongoing amortization in AES Indiana’s future rate cases. The order reserves all rights of all the parties with respect to the ratemaking treatment related to the regulatory assets, including the proper rate of return and mechanisms for recovery. \nIn December 2021, AES Indiana completed the acquisition of the Hardy Hills Solar Project, which is a 195 MW solar project to be developed and expected to commence operations in 2024. AES Indiana received an order from the IURC approving the project in June of 2021. In July 2021, AES Indiana executed an agreement to acquire the Petersburg Solar Project, which is a 250 MW solar and 180 MWh energy storage facility expected to commence operations in 2025. In November 2021, AES Indiana received an order from the IURC approving the project. \nIn December 2021 and 2022, AES Indiana received equity capital contributions of $\\$275$ million and $\\$253$ million, respectively, from AES and CDPQ on a proportional share basis to be used for funding needs related to AES Indiana’s TDSIC and replacement generation projects. \n# \nBusiness Description — DPL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is AES Ohio. AES Ohio is a utility company that transmits and distributes electricity to approximately 536,000 retail customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Ohio has the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services to its customers, and procures retail standard service offer (\"SSO\") electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental customers through a competitive bid auction process. In previous years, AES Ohio Generation was also a primary subsidiary, but DPL has systematically exited this generation business. AES Ohio Generation retired and sold its last remaining operating asset in 2020. \nKey Financial Drivers — AES Ohio's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand and weather. AES Ohio's financial results are likely to be driven by other factors as well, including, but not limited to: \nregulatory outcomes and impacts;   \nthe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulations; and timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — AES Ohio is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services and facilities, retail rate and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and certain other matters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over the delivery of electricity, SSO, and other retail electric services. \nElectric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a Competitive Retail Electric Service (\"CRES\") provider or from their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ohio utilities have the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services in their state-certified territories. While Ohio allows customers to choose retail generation providers, AES Ohio is required to provide retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that ha not signed a contract with a CRES provider or as a provider of last resort in the event of a CRES provider default. SSO rates are subject to rule and regulations of the PUCO and are established through a competitive bid process for the supply of power to SSO customers. \nAES Ohio's distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. AES Ohio is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure, and cost of capital. AES Ohio's retail rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costs incurred related to power purchased through the competitive bid process,"

        "text": "participation in the PJM RTO, severe storm damage, and energy efficiency. AES Ohio's transmission rates are regulated by FERC. \nIn March 2020, AES Ohio filed an application for a formula-based rate for its transmission service, which was approved and made effective May 3, 2020. In December 2020, an uncontested settlement was reached regarding these rates and filed with the FERC. It was approved on April 15, 2021. \nAES Ohio is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of a multi-state region, including Ohio. PJM also administers the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members. \nOhio law requires utilities to file either an Electric Security Plan (\"ESP\") or MRO plan to establish SSO rates. On December 18, 2019, the PUCO approved AES Ohio's Notice of Withdrawal and reversion to its prior rate plan (ESP 1). Among other items, the PUCO Order approving the ESP 1 rate plan includes reinstating the non-bypassable RSC Rider, which provides annual revenues of approximately $\\$79$ million. The OCC has appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, the Commission’s decision approving the reversion to ESP 1 as well as argued for a refund of the Rate Stabilization Charge (\"RSC\") revenues dating back to August 2021. A decision is pending. We are unable to predict the outcome of this appeal, but if this results in terms that are more adverse than AES Ohio's current ESP rate plan, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nOn September 26, 2022, AES Ohio filed its latest ESP (\"ESP 4\") with the PUCO. ESP 4 is a comprehensive plan to enhance and upgrade its network and improve service reliability, provide greater safeguards for price stability and continue investments in local economic development. As part of this plan, AES Ohio intends to increase investments in the distribution infrastructure and deploy a proactive vegetation management program. The plan also includes proposals for new customer programs, including renewable options, electric vehicle programs and energy efficiency programs for residential and low-income customers. ESP 4 also seeks to recover outstanding regulatory assets not currently in rates. AES Ohio did not propose that the Rate Stabilization Charge would continue as part of ESP 4. The plan requires PUCO approval, which we anticipate in 2023. \nOn November 30, 2020, AES Ohio filed a new distribution rate case application with the PUCO to increase AES Ohio’s base rates for electric distribution service to address, in part, increased costs of materials and labor and substantial investments to improve distribution structures. On December 14, 2022, the PUCO issued an order on the application. Among other matters, the order (i) establishes a revenue increase of $\\$76$ million for AES Ohio’s base rates for electric distribution service and (ii) provides for a return on equity of $9.999\\%$ and a cost of long-term debt of $4.4\\%$ on a rate base of $\\$783$ million and based on a capital structure of $53.87\\%$ equity and $46.13\\%$ long-term debt. This increase will go into effect when AES Ohio has a new electric security plan in place, which we anticipate in 2023. \nSmart Grid and Comprehensive Settlement — On October 23, 2020, AES Ohio entered into a Stipulation and Recommendation (settlement) with the staff of the PUCO and various customers, and organizations representing customers of AES Ohio and certain other parties with respect to, among other matters, AES Ohio's applications pending at the PUCO for (i) approval of AES Ohio's plan to modernize its distribution grid (the \"Smart Grid Plan\"), (ii) findings that AES Ohio passed the Significantly Excessive Earnings Test (\"SEET\") for 2018 and 2019, and (iii) findings that AES Ohio's current ESP 1 satisfies the SEET and the more favorable in the aggregate (\"MFA\") regulatory test. In June 2021, the PUCO issued their opinion and order accepting the stipulation as filed. With the PUCO’s issuance of their opinion and order, AES made cash contributions of $\\$150$ million in 2021 to improve AES Ohio's infrastructure and modernize its grid while maintaining liquidity. Several applications for rehearing of the PUCO's orders relating to the comprehensive settlement were filed and denied on December 1, 2021. The OCC appealed this final PUCO Order to the Ohio Supreme Court on December 6, 2021; this appeal remains pending. \nSeparate from the ESP process, on January 23, 2020, AES Ohio filed with the PUCO requesting approval to defer its decoupling costs consistent with the methodology approved in its Distribution Rate Case. If approved, deferral would be effective December 18, 2019 and going forward would reduce impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs, and economic changes in customer demand. An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on May 4, 2021. These amounts were also included in the ESP 4 application and are proposed to be recovered in a new rider. \nDevelopment Strategy — Planned construction projects primarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to AES Ohio's transmission and distribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments, and changing environmental standards, among other factors."

        "text": "AES Ohio is projecting to spend an estimated $\\$1.2$ billion on capital projects from 2023 through 2025, which includes expected spending under AES Ohio's Smart Grid Plan included in the Stipulation and Recommendation entered into in October 2020 (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure above) as well as other new transmission and distribution projects. The Smart Grid Plan, as approved, provides for a return on and recovery of up to $\\$249$ million of Phase 1 investments and recovery of operational and maintenance expenses through AES Ohio's existing Infrastructure Investment Rider for a term of four years, under an aggregate cap of $\\$268$ million on the amount of such investments and expenses that is recoverable, and an acknowledgement that AES Ohio may file a subsequent application with the PUCO within three years seeking approvals for Phase 2 of the Smart Grid Plan. AES Ohio’s spending programs are contingent on successful regulatory outcomes in pending proceedings. \n# \nBusiness Description — AES' U.S. renewables portfolio, referred to as AES Clean Energy, is one of the top U.S. renewables growth platforms. AES Clean Energy aims to solve customers' energy challenges by offering an expanded portfolio of innovative solutions based on cutting-edge technologies that are designed to accelerate their energy futures. The generation capacity of the systems owned and/or operated under AES Clean Energy is 4,919 MW across the U.S., with another 2,862 MW under construction, including 1,707 MW of solar, 639 MW of wind, and 516 MW of energy storage. AES Clean Energy has a 5.2 GW backlog of projects, the majority of which are expected to come online through 2025. The adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") in 2022 is expected to be a significant accelerant to the growth of the U.S. renewables market and AES plans to meet this demand with its 51 GW development pipeline. \nAES Clean Energy comprises AES Renewable Holdings, sPower, AES Clean Energy Development (\"ACED\"), and other renewable assets, as part of its broader investments in the U.S. ACED was formed on February 1, 2021, as specifically identified projects in the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms were merged. ACED serves as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. Following the merger, ACED expanded through the acquisitions of the Valcour Intermediate Holdings wind platform and Community Energy, a U.S. solar developer. AES Clean Energy has also grown organically at a rapid pace and now has more than 1,000 employees, in contrast to less than 500 employees at the time of its formation in 2021. During the same time period, the development pipeline has also more than doubled. \nIn line with AES' strategy of using partnerships to promote the effective deployment of capital, in February 2023, the Company sold $49\\%$ of its indirect interest in a $1.3\\mathsf{G W}$ portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\") that includes 17 solar projects and one wind project, located across six states, to Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. \nKey Financial Drivers — The financial results of AES Clean Energy are primarily driven by the efficient construction and operation of renewable energy facilities across the U.S. under long-term PPAs, through which the energy price on the entire production of these facilities is guaranteed. Tax credits associated with the development of U.S. renewables projects can be substantial and have increased with the adoption of the IRA. In 2022, AES recognized $\\$246$ million of pre-tax contribution related to the allocation of tax credits to tax equity partners of U.S. renewables projects. The financial results of U.S. renewable assets are primarily driven by the amount of wind or solar resource at the facilities, availability of facilities, growth in projects, and by tax credit recognition once placed in service. \nA majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the earnings reported at the facilities. In 2022, AES Clean Energy largely generated investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") from its renewable assets. We expect that the extension of the current ITCs and production tax credits (\"PTCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements under the IRA, will increase demand for our renewable products. \nLaurel Mountain, Buffalo Gap I, Buffalo Gap II, and Buffalo Gap III are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and their revenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations. Laurel Mountain also operates 16 MW of battery energy storage that is sold into the PJM market as regulation energy. For these projects, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results. \nDevelopment Strategy — As states, communities, and organizations of all types make commitments and plan to reduce their carbon footprints, renewables are the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the U.S. AES Clean Energy works with its customers to cocreate and deliver the smarter, greener energy solutions that meet"

        "text": "their needs, including 24/7 carbon-free energy. For example. AES has worked with several major technology companies to provide clean energy solutions to power their network of data centers. \nIn 2022, AES Clean Energy signed or was awarded 1,990 MW of PPAs. As of December 31, 2022, AES Clean Energy's renewable project backlog includes 5.2 GW of projects for which long-term PPAs have been signed or, as applicable, tariffs have been assigned through a regulatory process. The budget for construction of the projects currently under construction and the contracted projects is over $\\$6$ billion. The IRA includes increases, extensions, and/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage, and hydrogen projects. These changes in tax policy are supportive of our strategy to grow the AES Clean Energy business through development of our 51 GW U.S. pipeline. \nTo support this growth and address challenges related to a primarily foreign supply chain for solar panels, AES has spearheaded the creation of a U.S. Solar Buyer Consortium, in cooperation with other leading solar companies, with the intent to support the development of U.S. domestic solar manufacturing. \nAES Clean Energy is actively developing new products and renewable sites to serve the current and future needs of its customers. To further this aim, AES Clean Energy matured its pipeline and expanded it to a total of 51 GW during 2022. \n# \nBusiness Description — In the U.S., we own a conventional generation portfolio. The principal markets and locations where we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the California Independent System Operator (\"CAISO\"), PJM, and Puerto Rico. AES Southland, operating in the CAISO, is our most significant generation business. AES Hawaii previously operated a coal plant under a PPA. The PPA expired and the plant was retired in the third quarter of 2022. \nMany of our non-renewable U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet certain requirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas prices are generally set domestically. Recently we have seen international impacts on domestic gas prices (Henry Hub) due to the large amount of U.S. natural gas that can be exported through the liquefaction plants that have come online in recent years. Price variations for these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses. \nThe generation businesses with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment partially based on the market price of fuel. When market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue may change as fuel prices fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should remain consistent. These businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under their PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, and fuel flexibility. \nWarrior Run currently operates as a QF, as defined under the PURPA. This business entered into a long-term contract with an electric utility that had a mandatory obligation to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e. the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling application in certain proportions to the facility's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria or be a cogeneration facility that simultaneously generates electricity and process heat or steam. \nOur non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, amending the Public Utility Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”). These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the Energy Policy Act and FERC's regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry, and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. \nThe U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and"

These rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.—Risk Factors for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory matters. \n# \nBusiness Description — AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California by aggregate installed capacity, with an installed gross capacity of 3,799 MW at the end of 2022. The five coastal power plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important role in integrating the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California. AES Southland is composed of three once-through cooling (\"OTC\") power plants, two combined cycle gas-fired generation facilities and an interconnected battery-based energy storage facility. \nSouthland — Southland comprises AES Huntington Beach, LLC, AES Alamitos, LLC, and AES Redondo Beach (\"Southland OTC units\"). The Southland OTC units are contracted through Resource Adequacy Purchase Agreements (“RAPAs”). Under the RAPAs, as approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, these generating stations provide resource adequacy capacity, and have no obligation to produce or sell any energy to the RAPA counterparty. However, the generating stations are required to bid energy into the California ISO markets. Southland OTC units enter into commodity swap contracts to economically hedge price variability inherent in electricity sales arrangements. Compensation under these RAPAs is dependent on the availability of the Southland OTC units in the California ISO market. Failure to achieve the minimum availability target would result in an assessed penalty. \nThe SWRCB OTC Policy previously required the shutdown and permanent retirement of all remaining Southland OTC generating units by December 31, 2020, and there is currently no plan to replace the OTC generating units at the AES Redondo Beach generating station following the retirement. On January 23, 2020, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures adopted a recommendation to present to the SWRCB to extend OTC compliance dates for the remaining Southland OTC units at AES Huntington Beach and AES Alamitos until December 31, 2023 and AES Redondo Beach until December 31, 2021. On September 1, 2020, in response to a request by the state's energy, utility, and grid operators and regulators, the SWRCB approved amendments to its OTC. The SWRCB public hearing regarding the final decision on the amendment of the OTC policy was held on October 19, 2021 and the Board voted in favor of extending the compliance date for AES Redondo Beach to December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2022, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures approved a recommendation to the SWRCB to consider an extension of the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach and AES Alamitos to December 31, 2026, in support of grid reliability. The SWRCB staff released a draft OTC Policy amendment on January 31, 2023 to be heard by the SWRCB on March 7, 2023. The final decision from SWRCB is expected during the second half of 2023. See United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations—Cooling Water Intake for further discussion of AES Southland’s plans regarding the OTC Policy. \nSouthland Energy — AES Huntington Beach Energy, LLC, AES Alamitos Energy, LLC, and AES ES Alamitos, LLC (collectively \"Southland Energy\") each operate under 20-year tolling agreements with Southern California Edison (\"SCE\") to provide 1,387 MW of combined cycle gasfired generation (through 2040) and 100 MW of interconnected battery-based energy storage (through 2041). \nThe contracts are RAPAs with annual energy tolling put options. If Southland Energy exercises the annual put option, all capacity, energy and ancillary services will be sold to SCE in exchange for a monthly energy and fixed capacity payment that covers fixed operating cost, debt service, and return on capital. In addition, SCE will reimburse variable costs and provide the natural gas. Southland Energy may exercise the annual put option for any contract year by delivering notice of such exercise to SCE at least one year before the start of such contract year, and no more than two years before the start of any contract year. If the annual put options are not exercised, Southland Energy is required to sell the physical output of the combined cycle gas-fired generation units to AES Integrated Energy. AES Integrated Energy is required to bid energy into the California ISO market. Southland Energy continues to receive the monthly fixed capacity payments for periods when the put option is not exercised. \nKey Financial Drivers — AES Southland's availability is one of the most important drivers of operations, along with market demand and prices for gas and electricity."

Both plants are fully contracted through long-term PPAs with PREPA expiring in 2027 and 2037, respectively. AES Puerto Rico receives a capacity payment based on the plants' twelve month rolling average availability, receiving the full payment when the availability is $90\\%$ or higher. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico for further discussion of the long-term PPAs with PREPA. \nKey Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, improved operational performance and plant availability. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — Puerto Rico has a single electric grid managed by PREPA, a state-owned entity that provides virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits, and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. Since June 2021, PREPA has contracted LUMA Energy to manage the transmission, distribution and commercialization activities. The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau is the main regulatory body. The bureau approves wholesale and retail rates, sets efficiency and interconnection standards, and oversees PREPA's compliance with Puerto Rico's renewable portfolio standard. \nPuerto Rico's electricity is $98\\%$ produced by thermal plants ( $48\\%$ from petroleum, $33\\%$ from natural gas, and $17\\%$ from coal), while the emaining $2\\%$ is supplied by renewable resources (wind, solar, and hydro). \nDevelopment Strategy — Puerto Rico has clear goals of supplying its system from renewable resources, with targets of $40\\%$ from renewables by 2025 and $100\\%$ from renewables by 2050. To achieve the established targets, PREPA intends to issue six requests for proposal for generation from renewable sources in the coming years. The first request for proposal was issued on February 22, 2021. AES Puerto Rico, through AES Clean Flexible Energy, is working to deliver green energy solutions to meet the country's needs, with a long-term strategy to achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy. AES Clean Flexible Energy expects to have a portfolio of solar and storage projects participating. As applicable, tariffs will be assigned through a regulatory process. AES Clean Flexible Energy is actively developing new renewable sites to serve the future needs of Puerto Rico and its communities. On August 26, 2022, AES Clean Flexible Energy and PREPA fully executed six contracts (four power purchase and operating agreements and two energy storage service agreements) for a total installed capacity of 245 MW Solar PV and 200 MW-4h Storage.

        "text": "The following map illustrates the location of our South America facilities: \n# \n\n# \nBusiness Description — In Chile, through AES Andes, we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in the SEN—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Andes is the third largest generation operator in Chile in terms of installed capacity with 3,299 MW, excluding energy storage, and has a market share of approximately $11\\%$ as of December 31, 2022. \nAES Andes owns a diversified generation portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers, and energy resources. AES Andes' generation plants are located near the principal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso, and Antofagasta. AES Andes' diverse generation portfolio provides flexibility for the management of contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers, provides backup energy to the spot market and facilitates operations under a variety of market and hydrological conditions. \nAES Andes' Green Blend strategy aims to reduce carbon intensity and incorporate renewable energy to extend our existing conventional PPAs. This strategy de-links company's PPAs from legacy fossil resources, grows its renewable energy portfolio, and delivers a competitive, reliable energy solution. In line with the Green Blend strategy, AES Andes has committed to not build additional coal-based power plants and to advance the development of new renewable projects, including the implementation of battery energy storage systems (\"BESS\") and other technological innovations that will provide greater flexibility and reliability to the system. \nAES Andes currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 10 years, with regulated distribution companies and unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include pass-through mechanisms for fuel costs along with price indexations to U.S. Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\"). \nIn addition to energy payments, AES Andes also receives capacity payments to compensate for availability during periods of peak demand.

        "text": "capacity requirements for each power plant. The capacity price is fixed semiannually by the National Energy Commission and indexed to the CP and other relevant indices. \nKey Financial Drivers — Hedging strategies at AES Andes limit volatility to the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: \nspot market prices (largely impacted by dry hydrology scenarios, forced outages and international fuel prices);   \nchanges in current regulatory rulings altering the ability to pass through or recover certain costs;   \nfluctuations of the Chilean peso;   \ntax policy changes; and legislation promoting renewable energy and/or more restrictive regulations on thermal generation assets. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Chilean electricity industry is divided into three business segments: generation, transmission, and distribution. Private companies operate in all three segments, and generators can enter into PPAs to sell energy to regulated and unregulated customers, as well as to other generators in the spot market. \nChile operates in a single power market, referred to as the SEN, which is managed by the grid operator CEN. The SEN has an installed capacity of 31,141 MW, and represents $99\\%$ of the installed generation capacity of the country. \nCEN coordinates all generation and transmission companies in the SEN. CEN minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, while maximizing service quality and reliability requirements. CEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost. In the south-central region of the SEN, thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric, solar, and wind output and is critical to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrological conditions in the highest demand area of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN, which includes the Atacama Desert, thermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG, are indexed to international prices. In 2022, the installed generation capacity in the Chilean market was composed of $42\\%$ thermoelectric, $23\\%$ hydroelectric, $20\\%$ solar, $13\\%$ wind, and $2\\%$ other fuel sources. \nHydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrological conditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby influencing spot market prices. \nThe Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels. \nAll generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 5 MW. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5 MW can opt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in USD, although payments are made in Chilean pesos. \nThe Chilean government’s decarbonization plan includes the complete retirement of the SEN coal fleet by the end of 2040 and carbon neutrality by 2050. On December 26, 2020, the Ministry of Energy’s Supreme Decree Number 42 went into effect, allowing coal plants to enter into Strategic Reserve Status (“SRS”) and receive $60\\%$ of capacity payments for the 5-year period following its shutdown to remain connected as a backup in case of a system emergency. Following the issuance of this regulation and per the disconnection and termination agreement signed with the Chilean government in June 2019, AES Andes accelerated the retirement plans of its Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired units. On July 22, 2022, AES Andes was authorized by the CEN to retire, cease operations, and definitively disconnect Ventanas 1 from the SEN as of June 30, 2022. This coal-fired unit had been in SRS since December 29, 2020. Concurrently, AES Andes requested the shutdown of Ventanas 2 as soon as possible. Ventanas 2’s shut down and transition into SRS is pending resolution of current system transmission constraints in order to guarantee system stability and ensure a responsible energy transition. The unit’s retirement"

        "page_idx": 31,
        "text": "nto SRS has been postponed and is expected to occur during 2023. The definitive cessation of operations of Ventanas 2 is expected by December 29, 2025 as informed by the National Energy Commission on July 22, 2022 through Exempt Resolution No. 555. \nIn July 2021, AES Andes committed to allow the shutdown of coal-fired operations at its Ventanas 3, Ventanas 4, Angamos 1, and Angamos 2 units as soon as January 1, 2025, once the safety, sufficiency, and competitiveness of the system allows it. These four units together have an installed capacity of 1,095 MW and each unit has publicly announced phase-out plans in line with the Company’s decarbonization strategy. In July 2021, the Company also sold its entire ownership interest in Guacolda, a 764 MW coal-fired plant located in Chile. Guacolda, Ventanas, and Angamos represent an aggregate of $2.2\\mathsf{G W}$ of coal-fired capacity, or $72\\%$ of AES Andes’ legacy coal fleet. AES Andes continues to work under the Green Blend strategy to accelerate the phase-out of the remaining two coal-fired plants. \nEnvironmental Regulation — Chilean law requires all electricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations with non-conventional renewable energy (\"NCRE\"). Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by building NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and small hydroelectric technology) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Noncompliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES Andes currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Andes' solar, wind, and biomass power plants. \nSince 2017, emissions of particulate matter, ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ , ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ , and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these emissions are taxed. In the case of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , the tax is equivalent to $\\$5$ per ton emitted. Certain PPAs have clauses allowing the Company to pass the green tax costs to unregulated customers, while some distribution PPAs do not allow for the pass through of these costs. During 2021, the Chilean General Water Direction, as part of the Ministry of Public Works, established the obligation to install and maintain effective monitoring systems for water withdrawal. We are currently implementing these systems in the power plants for which they are required. \nDuring 2022, new regulations associated with monitoring requirements were published, including Law 21,455, which is the framework on climate change; the new Ventanas power plant Operational Plan; emission standards for back up generators; and recently enacted Law 21,505, which promotes electric energy storage and electromobility. A Prioritized Program of Standards was published, establishing a set of environmental regulations that will impose new obligations for projects both in operation and under construction, including the regulation of environmental noise, thermoelectric power plant emissions, industrial liquid waste, Green Tax offsets, and environmental quality regulations for the protection of marine waters and sediments of the Quintero-Puchuncaví Bay, among others. \nAES Andes and its subsidiaries are undergoing administrative environmental sanctioning processes. The compliance programs associated with the Ventanas power plant and the Mesamávida wind farm are being executed, and the compliance program associated with the Cochrane power plant is under review by the authority. The Angamos power plant is currently undergoing an environmental review process of the Environmental Qualification Resolution (RCA in Chile). See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings of this Form $10-\\mathsf{K}$ for further discussion. \nDevelopment Strategy — AES Andes is committed to reducing the coal intensity of the Chilean power grid and plans to increase the renewable energy capacity in its portfolio. As part of this commitment, there are several projects under construction to supply agreements with its main mining customers in execution of the new Green Blend strategy by integrating renewable energy sources into its portfolio, and by providing contracting options that contain a mix of both renewable and nonrenewable solutions. In total, the pipeline currently has 4.2 GW under development at different stages and diversified geographically. \nWithin this portfolio, the Company has made significant progress in the development of NCRE projects that are already contracted. In the Biobío region, the Rinconada wind project (258 MW) is being developed, and in Antofagasta, a new expansion of the Andes Solar power plant is being developed, which will include a battery system to optimize solar generation $\\cdot186~\\mathsf{M W}+186~\\mathsf{M W}{-}5\\mathsf{h r})$ . \nIn addition, Empresa Eléctrica Angamos, a subsidiary of AES Andes, submitted for environmental processing a worldwide pioneering initiative, referred to as the Alba project, that seeks an alternative for the conversion of thermoelectric plants through the use of molten salts. This project explores the possibility of replacing the current coal-fired generation of units 1 and 2 of the Angamos thermoelectric power plant, located in Mejillones, Antofagasta region, with a molten salt system. With this technology, renewable energy is stored as heat to later be used to provide energy and emission-free capacity to the electrical system."

        "text": "Empresa Eléctrica Angamos is also promoting the advancement of green hydrogen technology for mass production through the Adelaida project, which involves the installation of a low-scale green hydrogen production plant with a capacity of 1,000 kg/day of green hydrogen, equivalent to 2.5 MW of power. \n# \nBusiness Description — We operate in Colombia through AES Colombia, a subsidiary of AES Andes, which owns Chivor, a hydroelectric plant with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric plant, both located approximately 160 km east of Bogota, as well as the solar facilities of Castilla, Brisas, and San Fernando, 21 MW, 27 MW, and 61 MW respectively. AES Colombia’s installed capacity accounted for approximately $6\\%$ of system capacity at the end of 2022. AES Colombia is dependent on hydrological conditions, which influence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia. \nAES Colombia's commercial strategy aims to execute contracts with commercial and industrial customers and bid in public tenders, mainly with distribution companies, in order to reduce margin volatility with proper portfolio risk management. The remaining energy generated by our portfolio is sold to the spot market, including ancillary services. Additionally, AES Colombia receives reliability payments for maintaining the plant's availability and generating firm energy during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent power shortages. \nKey Financial Drivers — Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's power generation. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while maximizing revenue through the sale of excess generation, is key to AES Colombia's results of operations. In addition to hydrology, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: \n• forced outages; fluctuations of the Colombian peso; and spot market prices. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN, which encompasses one-third of Colombia's territory, providing electricity to $97\\%$ of the country's population. The SIN's installed capacity, primarily hydroelectric $(67\\%)$ , other renewable $(3\\%)$ and thermal $(30\\%)$ , totaled 18,771 MW as of December 31, 2022. The marked seasonal variations in Colombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2022, $84\\%$ of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants. \nThe electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale of electricity, and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution of electricity. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by Colombian laws and CREG, the Colombian regulating entity for energy and gas. Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeing utility companies; and the Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion planning of the generation and transmission network. \nThe generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices. The National Dispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units. \nThe expansion of the system is supported by two schemes: i) reliability charge auctions where firm energy commitments are focused on conventional technology power plants, and ii) auctions of long-term energy contracts assigned for periods of 15 years aimed at non-conventional renewable resources. \nEnvironmental Regulation — Decree 1076 of 2015 established the current Environmental Licensing Scheme that defines the scope of the National Environmental Licensing Authority (\"ANLA\") for granting environmental licenses. In recent years, the Ministry of the Environment has generated regulations in connection with licenses, such as the biotic compensation methodology and guidance for presentation of environmental studies in 2018, and the regulation of minor changes to environmental licenses in 2022. AES Colombia has obtained environmental licenses for 406 MW of wind projects included in its development pipeline. \nDevelopment Strategy — AES Colombia is committed to supporting its customers to diversify their energy supply and become more competitive. As part of this commitment, AES Colombia is developing a pipeline of 1.3"

Of this ,149 MW, 255 MW were awarded a 15-year PPA at the renewable auction in 2019. \n# \nBusiness Description — AES operates plants in Argentina totaling 4,220 MW, representing $10\\%$ of the country's total installed capacity. AES owns a diversified generation portfolio in Argentina in terms of geography, technology, and fuel source. AES Argentina's plants are placed in strategic locations within the country in order to provide energy to the spot market and customers, making use of wind, hydro, and thermal plants. \nAES primarily sells its energy in the wholesale electricity market where prices are largely regulated. In 2022, approximately $84\\%$ of the energy was sold in the wholesale electricity market and $16\\%$ was sold under contract sales made by TermoAndes, Vientos Neuquinos, and Vientos Bonaerenses power plants. \nKey Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: \nforced outages;   \nexposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso;   \nchanges in hydrology and wind resources;   \ntimely collection of FONINVEMEM installments and outstanding receivables (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below);   \nnatural gas prices and availability for contracted generation at TermoAndes; and domestic energy demand and exports. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — Argentina has one main power system, the SADI, which serves $96\\%$ of the country. As of December 31, 2022, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 42,927 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectric generation $(59\\%)$ and hydroelectric generation $(26\\%)$ , as well as wind $(8\\%)$ , nuclear $(4\\%)$ , and solar $(3\\%)$ . \nThermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural gas. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter periods (June to August) due to transport constraints result in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants. Hydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and, therefore, influence market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally from May to October. \nThe Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission, and distribution. The wholesale electric market is comprised of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies, and large customers who are permitted to trade electricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is responsible for dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the Secretariat of Energy regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, there is a tolling scheme in which the regulator establishes prices for electricity and defines fuel reference prices. As a result, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation. \nThe Argentine electric market is an \"average cost\" system. Generators are compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variable costs, under prices denominated in Argentine pesos. CAMMESA is in charge of providing the natural gas and liquid fuels required by the generation companies, except for coal. \nThe expansion of renewable capacity in the system is promoted by allowing the new power plants to sign contracts either with CAMMESA hrough the RenovAr program or directly by trading energy in the private market. \nDuring 2022, although the government increased prices to the end user, subsidies and the system deficit also increased. By December 022, distribution companies recovered an average $40\\%$ of the total cost of the system. \nIn past years, AES Argentina contributed certain accounts receivable to fund the construction of three power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years after commercial operation date of the related plant takes place. In 2020, FONINVEMEM I and II installments were fully repaid and in 2021 the ownership interests in Termoeléctrica San Martín and Termoeléctrica Manuel Belgrano were defined after the incorporation of the National Government as majority shareholder. The transfer of the power plants to these companies has not yet occurred. FONINVEMEM III is related to Termoeléctrica Guillermo Brown, which commenced operations in April 2016, and the installments are still being collected. AES Argentina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in this plant, which shall not be greater than $30\\%$ ,"

Since September 2019, currency controls have been established to govern the devaluation of the Argentine peso and keep Argentine central bank reserves at acceptable levels. \nEnvironmental Regulation — Argentina has agreed to commitments made by the international community ratified in the Paris Agreement nd in Law 27,270 passed in September 2016. \nIn October 2015, Law 27,191 was passed, seeking to create a successful framework for the development of renewable energy. This law set an objective of $8\\%$ renewable energy by 2017 and $20\\%$ by 2025 and also introduced tax exemptions for importing equipment used in the construction of renewable energy projects in addition to other tax benefits. This framework fostered AES Argentina's construction of Vientos Bonaerenses and Vientos Neuquinos power plants, which are fully contracted with national and private customers in the long term. \nIn December 2019, Law 27,520 established a minimum budget to grant adequate actions, instruments, and strategies to mitigate and adapt to global climate change effects in all national territories and created the National Office of Climate Change to designate private and public actors to design policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gases and to provide coordinated responses in sectors that are vulnerable to climate change impacts. \nAll AES Argentina plants are certified under international standards of Quality (ISO 9001), Safety and Health (ISO 45.001) and Environment (ISO 14001). \nDevelopment Strategy — Leveraging existing wind operating facilities in southern Buenos Aires and market opportunities, AES Argentina is developing 890 MW of wind greenfield projects that are in mid-to-late stages of development and could be funded locally. These projects are adjacent or nearby to AES Argentina's operating assets and will be used to participate in future private auctions for renewable PPAs. \n# \nBusiness Description — AES Brasil owns a diversified generation portfolio in Brazil and its plants are placed in strategic locations within th ountry in order to provide energy to customers and the regulated market, making use of hydro, solar, and wind generation. \nAES Brasil owns 12 hydroelectric power plants in the state of São Paulo with total installed capacity of 2,658 MW, which represents approximately $11\\%$ of the total generation capacity in the state of São Paulo and $2\\%$ of the hydropower physical guarantee of the hydrological risk sharing system (Energy Reallocation Mechanism or \"MRE\", as described below in the topic \"Regulatory Framework and Market Structure\"). These hydroelectric plants operate under a 33-year concession expiring in 2032. \nOver the past three years, AES Brasil acquired and developed three solar power plants in the state of São Paulo, which are fully contracte with 20-year PPAs and together account for 295 MW of installed capacity. \nAES Brasil has also invested in wind generation which is fully contracted in the regulated market and currently owns the following perational wind complexes: \nAlto Sertão II, located in the state of Bahia with an installed capacity of 386 MW and subject to 20-year PPAs expiring between 2033 and 2035;   \n• Ventus, located in the state of Rio Grande do Norte with an installed capacity of 187 MW and subject to a 20-year PPA expiring in 2034;   \nMandacaru and Salinas, located in the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará with 159 MW of installed capacity, fully sold in the regulated market for 20 years; and   \n• Ventos do Araripe, Caetés, and Cassino, acquired in November 2022 and located in the states of Piaui and Pernambuco, in the northeast region of Brazil, and Rio Grande do Sul in the south region, respectively. The complexes have been operational since 2015 with 456 MW of installed capacity, sold in the regulated market for 20 years."

        "text": "AES Brasil aims to contract most of its physical guarantee requirements and sell the remaining portion in the spot market. The commercial strategy is reassessed periodically according to changes in market conditions, hydrology, and other factors. AES Brasil generally sells available energy through medium-term bilateral contracts. \nIn the second half of 2020, AES acquired an additional $19.8\\%$ ownership in AES Brasil and on December 31, 2020 its economic interest was $44.1\\%$ . Through multiple transactions in 2021, AES acquired an additional $1.6\\%$ ownership in AES Brasil. Additionally, AES migrated AES Brasil's shares to the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance in Brazil, requiring equity capital to be composed only of common shares. The reorganization and the exchange of shares was completed on March 26, 2021, and the shares issued by AES Brasil started trading on Novo Mercado on March 29, 2021. The Company maintained majority representation on AES Brasil’s board of directors. \nIn October 2021, as part of the reorganization process, AES Brasil concluded a follow-on offering for the issuance of 93 million newly issued shares to fund its renewable energy portfolio at a cost of $\\$207$ million. As a result, AES' indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil increased $1\\%$ , from $45.7\\%$ to $46.7\\%$ . \nIn September 2022, AES Brasil commenced a private placement offering for its existing shareholders to subscribe for up to 116 million newly issued shares. The offering concluded on October 3, 2022 with a total of 107 million shares subscribed at a cost of $\\$197$ million. AES Holding Brazil acquired 54 million shares, thereby increasing AES’ indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil from $46.7\\%$ to $47.4\\%$ . AES Brasil is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nKey Financial Drivers — The electricity market in Brazil is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, therefore electricity pricing driven by hydrology. Plant availability is also a significant financial driver as in times of high hydrology, AES is more exposed to the spot marke AES Brasil's financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: \nhydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in the MRE (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below for further information); growth in demand for energy; market price risk when re-contracting; asset management; cost management; and ability to execute on its growth strategy. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy a generation plant can sell, called physical guarantee, representing the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, physical guarantee energy can be sold to distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy trading companies. \nBrazil has installed capacity of 191 GW, composed of hydroelectric $(58\\%)$ , thermoelectric $(25\\%)$ , renewable $(16\\%)$ , and nuclear $(1\\%)$ sources. Operation is centralized and controlled by the national operator, ONS, and regulated by the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (\"ANEEL\"). The ONS dispatches generators based on their marginal cost of production and on the risk of system rationing. Key variables for the dispatch decision are forecasted hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices, and thermal generation availability. \nIn case of unfavorable hydrology, the ONS will reduce hydroelectric dispatch to preserve reservoir levels and increase dispatch of thermal plants to meet demand. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) higher energy spot prices due to higher energy production costs at thermal plants and (ii) the need for hydro plants to purchase energy in the spot market to fulfill their contractual obligations. \nA mechanism known as the MRE (Energy Reallocation Mechanism) was created under ONS to share hydrological risk across MRE hydro generators by using a generation scaling factor (\"GSF\") to adjust generators' physical guarantee during periods of hydrological scarcity. If the hydro plants generate less than the total MRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market. When total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE physical guarantee, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they may sell the excess energy on the spot market."

        "text": "In September 2020, Law 14.052/2020 published by ANEEL was approved by the President, establishing terms for compensation to MRE hydro generators for the incorrect application of the GSF mechanism from 2013 to 2018, which resulted in higher charges assessed to MRE hydro generators by the regulator. Under the law, compensation was in the form of an offer for a concession extension for each hydro generator in exchange for full payment of billed GSF trade payables, the amount of which was reduced in conjunction with the payment for a concession extension. On August 12, 2021, ANEEL published Resolution number 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession originally granted to AES Brasil's hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032. On April 14, 2022, the amended term was finalized and agreed upon by ANEEL and AES. \nEnvironmental Regulation — In Brazil, the National Environmental Council (\"CONAMA\") is responsible for environmental licensing procedures. Inspections are performed by authorities at federal, state and municipal levels. The programs developed by AES Brasil are designed to restore and preserve biodiversity and are in compliance with local procedures and the obligations assumed in AES Brasil's concession with the state government. AES Brasil's main environmental projects include a flora management program which guarantees the production of 1 million seedlings of native tree species, a reservoir repopulation program that aims to maintain the ichthyofauna biodiversity and guarantee continuity of fishing activity by riverside communities, a land fauna monitoring and conservation program, and a water quality monitoring program designed to further understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. \nIn addition, the monitoring and control of reservoir edges is carried out through continuous inspections by the technical team of the Center of Monitoring of Reservoirs (\"CMR\") through a system of detection of changes, satellite images, aerophotogrammetric surveys, and field inspections. \nDevelopment Strategy — AES Brasil's strategy is to grow by adding renewable capacity to its generation platform through acquisition or greenfield projects, to focus on client satisfaction and innovation to offer new products and energy solutions, and to be recognized for excellence in asset management. \nIn 2021, AES Brasil acquired the Cajuína wind complexes, 1,485 MW of installed capacity of greenfield wind power projects. Cajuína is comprised of the Santa Tereza, São Ricardo, and Serra Verde complexes located in the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará. In March 2022, AES Brasil won the competitive process for the acquisition of the Isolated Productive Unit Cordilheira dos Ventos, which consists of parts of the Facheiro II, Facheiro III, and Labocó projects located in the State of Rio Grande do Norte. These projects have a wind power development capacity of up to 305 MW and were added to the Cajuína wind complex pipeline. Part of Cajuína's capacity is committed under long-term PPAs and in 2022, investment agreements were closed with BRF and Unipar to develop projects of 168 MW and 91 MW, respectively, through joint venture partnerships. \nIn March 2022, AES Brasil acquired Sky Arinos, a solar project with installable capacity of 378 MW in the city of Arinos in the state of Mina Gerais. \nIn November 2022, AES Brasil acquired the Ventos do Araripe, Caetés, and Cassino wind complexes, with 456 MW of operational installed apacity located in the states of Piaui and Pernambuco, in the northeast region of Brazil, and Rio Grande do Sul, in the south region. \nUnder the current terms of the 2018 legal agreement in connection with AES Brasil's concession with the state government, AES Brasil is required to increase its capacity in the state of São Paulo by an additional 81 MW by October 2024. On November 30, 2021 AES Brasil acquired AGV Solar VII Geradora de Energia S.A, a special purpose entity with installable capacity of 33 MW of solar generation. AES Brasil continues to pursue new opportunities to achieve the additional capacity."

Generation companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and a competitive wholesale generation market. All generation, transmission, and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law. \nTwo main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law: \nThe National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. They propose and adopt policies and procedures to implement best practices, support the proper functioning and development of the energy sector, and promote investment. The Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal provisions, rules, and technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of electricity. They monitor behavior in the electricity market in order to prevent monopolistic practices. \nIn addition to the two agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to end users. \nThe Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 5,110 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal $(72\\%)$ , hydroelectric $(12\\%)$ , wind $(8\\%)$ , and solar $(8\\%)$ . \nDevelopment Strategy — AES will continue to develop the commercialization of natural gas and incorporate partners directly in gas infrastructure projects. AES partnered with Energas in a joint venture which has been operating the $50~\\mathsf{k m}$ Eastern Pipeline since February 2020. The joint venture is also developing an expanded LNG facility of 120,000 cubic meters, including additional storage, regasification, and truck loading capacity, for which the COD is expected in 2023. This will allow AES to reach new customers who have converted, or are in the process of converting, to natural gas as a fuel source, and better operational flexibility. \n# \nBusiness Description — AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants totaling 705 MW of generation capacity, a natural gas-fired power plant with 381 MW of generation capacity, a wind farm of 55 MW and four solar plants of 10 MW each, which collectively represent $30\\%$ of the total installed capacity in Panama. Furthermore, AES operates an LNG regasification facility, a 180,000 cubic meter storage tank, and a truck loading facility. \nThe majority of our hydroelectric plants in Panama are based on run-of-the-river technology, with the exception of 223 MW Changuinola plant with regulation reservoirs and the 260 MW Bayano plant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. Variations in hydrology can result in an excess or a shortfall in energy production relative to our contractual obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a shortfall position during the dry season from January through May, which is offset by thermal and wind generation since its behavior is opposite and complementary to hydro generation. \nOur hydro and thermal assets are mainly contracted through medium to long-term PPAs with distribution companies. A small volume of our hydro plants are contracted with unregulated users. Our hydro assets in Panama have PPAs with distribution companies expiring up to December 2030 for a total contracted capacity of 377 MW. Our thermal asset in Panama has PPAs with distribution companies for a total contracted capacity of 350 MW expiring in August 2028, which matches the term of the LNG supply agreement of such thermal assets. The LNG supply contract has enough flexibility to divert volumes to the Dominican Republic, which increases the connectivity of our two onshore terminals and allows to optimize the LNG position of the portfolio. Colon LNG Marketing continues developing the LNG market in Latin America, with clients already established in Panama and Colombia."

Generators can enter into short-term and long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into backup supply contracts with each other. Outside of PPAs, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity. \nThree main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law: \nThe National Secretary of Energy in Panama (\"SNE\") has the responsibilities of planning, supervising, and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. The SNE proposes laws and regulations to the executive agencies that regulate the procurement of energy and hydrocarbons for the country. The National Authority of Public Services (\"ASEP\") is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the regulations, control and oversight of public services in Panama, including electricity, the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities, and the companies that provide such services. The National Dispatch Center (\"CND\") is in charge of the operation of the system and the management of the electricity market. They are responsible for implementing the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National Dispatch Center's objective are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain the reliability and security of the electric power system. Short-term power pric are determined on an hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit. Physical generation of energy is determined as a result of the optimization of the economic dispatch regardless of contractual arrangements. \nPanama's current total installed capacity is 3,926 MW, composed of hydroelectric $(45\\%)$ , thermal $(37\\%)$ , wind $(7\\%)$ , and solar $(11\\%)$ generation. \nDevelopment Strategy — Given our LNG facility’s excess capacity in Panama, the company is developing natural gas supply solutions for third parties such as power generators and industrial and commercial customers. This strategy will support a growing demand for natural gas in the region and will contribute to AES' mission by reducing ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions as a result of using LNG. \nIn addition to investing in LNG infrastructure, AES is investing in renewable projects within the region. This will increase complementar non-hydro renewable assets in the system and contribute to the reduction of hydrological risk in Panama. \n# \nBusiness Description — AES has 1,361 MW of installed capacity in Mexico.

EVN, the national utility, owns $39\\%$ of installed generation capacity. \nThe government is in the process of realigning EVN-owned companies into three different independent operations in order to create a competitive power market. The first stage of this realignment was the implementation of the Competitive Electricity Market, which has been in operation since 2012. The second stage was the introduction of the Electricity Wholesale Market, which has been in operation since the beginning of 2019. The third and final stage impacts the Electricity Retail Market. The reforms are currently in development and pilot implementation is expected around 2024 timeframe. BOT power plants will not directly participate in the power market; alternatively, a single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on their behalf."

In October 2019, we received formal approval as a government-mandated investor in the Son My LNG terminal project in partnership with PetroVietnam Gas and in September 2021, we signed the joint venture agreement with PetroVietnam Gas. In April 2022, we, together with our partner PetroVietnam Gas, established Son My LNG Terminal LLC. In September 2019, we received formal approval as the government-mandated investor with $100\\%$ equity ownership in the Son My 2 CCGT project and executed a statutory memorandum of understanding with Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade in November 2019 to continue developing the Son My 2 CCGT project under Vietnam’s Build-Operate-Transfer legal framework. The Son My 2 CCGT project will utilize the Son My LNG terminal project and be its anchor customer. \n# \nBusiness Description — Our AES Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel thermal power plant. AES Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEK, the state-owned public electricity supplier, independent energy producer, and trading company. Maritza is contracted under a 15-year PPA that expires in May 2026. AES Maritza is collecting receivables from NEK in a timely manner. However, NEK's liquidity position is subject to political conditions and regulatory changes in Bulgaria. \nThe DG Comp is reviewing NEK’s PPA with AES Maritza pursuant to the European Union’s state aid rules. AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws. For additional details see Key Trends and Uncertainties in Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. \nAES also owns an $89\\%$ economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm (\"Kavarna\") with 156 MW of installed capacity. The power output of St. Nikola is sold to customers operating on the liberalized electricity market and the plant may receive additional revenue per the terms of an October 2018 Contract for Premium with the state-owned Electricity System Security Fund. \nKey Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: \nregulatory changes in the Bulgarian power market;   \nresults of the DG Comp review;   \navailability and load factor of the operating units;   \nthe level of wind resources for St. Nikola;   \nspot market price volatility beyond the level of compensation through the Contract for Premium for St. Nikola; and NEK's ability to meet the payment terms of the PPA contract with Maritza. \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — The electricity sector in Bulgaria allows both regulated and competitive segments. In its capacity as the public provider of electricity, NEK acts as a single buyer and seller for all regulated transactions on the market. Electricity outside the regulated market trades on one of the platforms of the Independent Bulgarian Electricity Exchange day-ahead market, intra-day market, or bilateral contracts market. \nBulgaria’s power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, universal access to the grid, and numerous cross-border connection with neighboring countries. In addition, it plays an important role in the energy balance in the southeast European region. \nIn December 2022, Bulgaria implemented Regulation 2022/1854, approved by the European Council in October 2022 as an emergency intervention aiming at limiting energy prices in Europe. The main measure of interest to AES in Bulgaria is the limitation of revenues for \"inframarginal\" producers, a category that includes renewables and other technologies which are providing electricity to the grid at a cost below the price level set by the more expensive “marginal” producers. While the adoption of this regulation has no impact on Maritza power plant, it essentially captures $90\\%$ of the incremental margin of Kavarna wind farm since it is now subject to a mandatory cap of €180/MWh on revenues. \nBulgaria has 13 GW of installed capacity enabling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and export energy. Installed capacity is primarily thermal $(45\\%)$ , hydro $(25\\%)$ , and nuclear $(16\\%)$ . \nEnvironmental Regulation — In July 2020, the EU approved the Next Generation EU (\"NGEU\") recovery instrument, which aims at mitigating the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and making"

        "text": "Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The grid-connected energy storage sector is expanding rapidly. By incorporating energy storage across the electric power network, utilities and communities around the world will optimize their infrastructure investments, increase network flexibility and resiliency, and accelerate cost-effective integration of renewable electricity generation. According to the BloombergNEF Global Energy Storage Outlook published in October 2022, global annual energy storage capacity installations, excluding residential, grew from approximately 600 MW a year in 2015 to 13 GW a year in 2022 and are expected to grow to 62 GW a year by 2030. Additional growth opportunities exist in the provision of operational and maintenance services associated with energy storage products, as well as the provision of digital applications and solutions to improve performance and economic output. Fluence is positioned to be a leading participant in this growth, with 1.9 GW of energy storage assets deployed and 4.3 GW of contracted backlog, with a gross global pipeline of 9.7 GW as of December 31, 2022. \n# \nBusiness Description — The Company holds an equity interest in Uplight as part of its digitization and growth strategy. Uplight offers a comprehensive digital platform for utility customer engagement. Uplight provides software and services to approximately 80 of the leading electric and gas utilities, principally in the U.S., with the mission of motivating and enabling energy users and providers to transition to a clean energy ecosystem. Uplight's solutions form a unified, end-to-end customer energy experience system that delivers innovative energy efficiency, demand response, and clean energy solutions quickly. Utility and energy company leaders rely on Uplight and its customer-focused digital energy experiences to improve customer satisfaction, reduce service costs, increase revenue, and reduce carbon emissions. \nThe Company holds a $29.4\\%$ ownership interest in Uplight, which continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and i reported as part of Corporate and Other. \nKey Financial Drivers — Uplight's financial results are driven by the rate of growth of new customers and the extension of additional services to existing customers. Revenue growth primarily drives its financial results, given the relative significance of fixed operating costs. \nDevelopment Strategy — AES' collaboration with Uplight is designed to create value for Uplight, AES, and their respective customers. AES Indiana and AES Ohio have implemented Uplight's consumer engagement solutions in support of energy efficiency and demand response programs, as well as piloted new solutions with Uplight. \n# \nBusiness Description — The Company made a strategic investment in 5B, a solar technology innovator with the mission to accelerate the transformation of the world to a clean energy future. 5B's technology design enables solar projects to be installed up to three times faster, while allowing for up to two times more energy within the same footprint and can sustain higher wind speeds than traditional solar plants. \nKey Financial Drivers — 5B is accounted for under the measurement alternative and AES will record income or loss only when it receives dividends from 5B or when there is a change in the observable price or an impairment of the investment. 5B is at the beginning of its growth and is expanding its ecosystem for global reach. \nDevelopment Strategy — In addition to a large global market for third party projects, we believe there is an addressable market of nearly 5 GW across our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2022, 5B has achieved sales orders of 175 MW. AES expects to utilize this technology in conjunction with ongoing automation and digital initiatives to speed up delivery time and lower costs. 5B technology has been deployed at multiple locations in AES including a 2 MW project in Panama and an 11 MW project in Chile, with future deployments expected across markets in the AES portfolio. \n# \nThe Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals), and certain air emissions, such as $\\mathsf{S O}_{2}$ , ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}},$ , particulate matter, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants.

For a discussion of the laws and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1.— Business of this Form $10-\\mathsf{K}$ under the applicable SBUs. \nMany of the countries in which the Company does business have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as combined fluidized bed boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ emissions and selective catalytic reduction for ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\times}$ emissions. \nEnvironmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would not be materially affected. \nVarious licenses, permits, and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions, or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form $10{\\cdot}K$ for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action. \n# \nIn the United States, the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ , ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ , particulate matter, GHGs, mercury, nd other hazardous air pollutants. Certain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below. \nCSAPR — CSAPR addresses the \"good neighbor\" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state’s nonattainment of, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The CSAPR required significant reductions in ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ and ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate. The Company is currently required to comply with the CSAPR in Indiana and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented in part through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed. \nIn October 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS (\"CSAPR Update Rule\"). The CSAPR Update Rule found that ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana and Maryland, and Ohio) affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated existing CSAPR ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets through modifications to the CSAPR ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation began in the 2017 ozone season and affected facilities began to receive fewer ozone season ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ allowances in 2017. Following legal challenges related to the CSAPR Update Rule, on April 30, 2021, EPA issued the Revised CSAPR Update Rule. The Revised CSAPR Update Rule required affected EGUs within certain states (including Indiana and Maryland) to participate in a new trading program, the CSAPR ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{x}}$ Ozone Season Group 3 trading program. These affected EGUs received fewer ozone season ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\times}$ Ozone Season allowances beginning in 2021, which may result in the need for AES affected facilitites to purchase additional allowances."

        "text": "On April 6, 2022, the EPA published a proposed Federal Implementation Plan (\"FIP\") to address air quality impacts with respect to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The rule would establish a revised CSAPR ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\times}$ Ozone Season Group 3 trading program for 25 states, including Indiana and Maryland. In addition to other requirements, if finalized, EGUs in these states would begin receiving fewer allowances as soon as 2023, which may result in the need to purchase additional allowances. \nWhile the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase additional allowances based on reduced allocations. \nNew Source Review (\"NSR\") — The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements if they meet the routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (\"RMRR\") exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty and significant litigation regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. Over the past several years, the EPA has filed suits against coal-fired power plant owners and issued NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including an NOV issued by the EPA against AES Indiana concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA. If NSR requirements are imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nRegional Haze Rule — The EPA's \"Regional Haze Rule\" established timelines for states to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States by establishing reasonable progress goals toward meeting a national goal of natural visibility conditions in Class I areas by the year 2064 through a series of state implementation plans (SIPs), which may result in additional emissions control requirements for electric generating units. SIPs for the first planning period (through 2018) did not result in material impact to AES facilities. For all future SIP planning periods, states must evaluate whether additional emissions reduction measures may be needed to continue making reasonable progress toward natural visibility conditions. The deadline for submittal of the SIP covering the second planning period was July 31, 2021. To date, none of the states in which we operate have submitted plans identifying potential impacts to Company facilities. However, we cannot predict the possible outcome or potential impacts of this matter at this time. \nNAAQS — Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, including ozone, particulate matter, ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ , and ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ , which result from coal combustion. Areas meeting the NAAQS are designated \"attainment areas\" while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered \"nonattainment areas.\" Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at five-year intervals. \nBased on the current and potential future ambient air standards, certain of the states in which the Company's subsidiaries operate have determined or will be required to determine whether certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to modify their SIPs to detail how the states will attain or maintain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the applicable state environmental regulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter, ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ , or ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ . The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be material. \nMercury and Air Toxics Standard — In April 2012, the EPA’s rule to establish maximum achievable control technology standards for hazardous air pollutants regulated under the CAA emitted from coal and oil-fired electric utilities, known as “MATS”, became effective and AES facilities implemented measures to comply, as applicable. \nIn June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded MATS to the D.C. Circuit due to the EPA’s failure to consider costs before deciding to regulate power plants under Section 112 of the CAA and subsequently remanded MATS to the EPA without vacatur. On May 22, 2020, the EPA published a final finding that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired electric generating units (EGUs) (reversing its prior 2016 finding), but that the EPA would not remove the source category from the CAA Section 112(c) list of source categories and would not change the MATS requirements. Several petitioners filed for judicial review of the final finding and the D.C. Circuit, on February 16, 2021, granted the EPA's request that the rule be held in abeyance pending the EPA's review. On February 9, 2022, the EPA published a proposed rule to revoke its"

Further rulemakings and/or proceedings are possible; however, in the meantime, MATS remains in effect. We currently cannot predict the outcome of the regulatory or judicial process, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance planning or ultimate costs. \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions — In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources, including a pre construction permitting program for certain new construction or major modifications, known as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\"PSD\"). If future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources become subject to PSD for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements and the cost of compliance with such requirements may be material. \nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NSPS for new electric generating units became effective, establishing $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions standards for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions from the plants. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed electric generating units, which will serve as a floor for future BACT determinations for such units. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations. On December 20, 2018, the EPA published proposed revisions to the final NSPS for new, modified, and reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units proposing that the best system of emissions reduction for these units is highly efficient generation that would be equivalent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units, and not partial carbon capture and sequestration, as was finalized in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for natural-gas combined cycle or simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposal. In January 2021, the EPA issued a final rule determining when standards are appropriate for GHG emissions from stationary source categories for new source but did not take final action on the 2018 proposal to revise the 2015 final NSPS. On April 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the final January 2021 final rule. Challenges to the GHG NSPS are being held in abeyance at this time. \nOn August 31, 2018, the EPA published in the Federal Register proposed Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE Rule along with associated revisions to implementing regulations. The final ACE Rule established $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission rules for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and replaced the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule (CPP). In accordance with the ACE Rule, the EPA determined that heat rate improvement measures are the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. The final rule required states, including Indiana and Maryland, to develop a State Plan to establish $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission limits for designated facilities, including AES Indiana Petersburg's and AES Warrior Run's coal-fired electric generating units. States had three years to develop their plans under the rule. However, on January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to the EPA the ACE Rule, but withheld issuance of the mandate that would effectuate its decision. On February 22, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA's unopposed motion for a partial stay of the issuance of the mandate on vacating the repeal of the CPP. On March 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit issued the partial mandate effectuating the vacatur of the ACE Rule. In effect, the CPP did not take effect while the EPA is addressing the remand of the ACE rule by promulgating a new Section 111(d) rule to regulate greenhouse gases from existing electric generating units. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions to review the decision by the D.C. Circuit to vacate the ACE Rule. On June 30, 2022, Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The opinion held that the “generation shifting” approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to EPA by Congress under Section 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C. Circuit recalled its March 5, 2021 partial mandate and issued a new partial mandate holding pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while EPA develops a replacement rule. The impact of the results of further proceedings and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material. The impact of the results of such litigation and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material. \nOn January 20, 2021, President Biden signed and submitted an instrument for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement effective February 19, 2021. In addition, in November 2022, the international community gathered in Egypt at the 27th Conference to the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"COP27\"), during which multiple announcements were made, including the establishment of a loss and damage fund to support vulnerable countries dealing with the effects of climate change and certain pledges in the area of climate finance."

        "text": "As such, there is some uncertainty with respect to the impact of GHG rules. The GHG BACT requirements will not apply at least until we construct a new major source or make a major modification of an existing major source, and the NSPS will not require us to comply with an emissions standard until we construct a new electric generating unit. We do not have any planned major modifications of an existing source or plans to construct a new major source at this time which are expected to be subject to these regulations. Furthermore, the EPA, states, and other utilities are still evaluating potential impacts of the GHG regulations in our industry. In light of these uncertainties, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA’s current and future GHG regulations on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. \nDue to the future uncertainty of these regulations and associated litigation, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with a new Section 111(d) Rule, should it be implemented in a prior or a substantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the EPA that rescinds or substantively revises the NSPS, it could impact any Company plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \nCooling Water Intake — The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA effective in 2014 that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at power plants and other facilities. These standards require affected facilities to choose among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, certain facilities must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. It is possible that this process, which includes permitting and public input, could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. \nAES Southland's current plan is to comply with the SWRCB OTC Policy by shutting down and permanently retiring all existing generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach, and AES Redondo Beach that utilize OTC by the compliance dates included in the OTC Policy. The SWRCB reviews the implementation plan and latest information on OTC generating unit retirement dates and new generation availability to evaluate the impact on electrical system reliability and OTC compliance dates for specific units. \nThe Company’s California subsidiaries have signed 20-year term PPAs with Southern California Edison for the new generating capacity, which have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Construction of new generating capacity began in June 2017 at AES Huntington Beach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos. The new air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators and battery energy storage systems were constructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating stations. The new air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating stations began commercial operation in early 2020 and there is currently no plan to replace the OTC generating units at the AES Redondo Beach generating station following the retirement. Certain OTC units were required to be retired in 2019 to provide interconnection capacity and/or emissions credits prior to startup of the new generating units, and the remaining AES OTC generating units in California will be shutdown and permanently retired by the OTC Policy compliance dates for these units. The SWRCB OTC Policy required the shutdown and permanent retirement of all remaining OTC generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach, and AES Redondo Beach by December 31, 2020. The initial amendment extended the deadline for shutdown and retirement of AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach’s remaining OTC generating units to December 31, 2023 and extended the deadline for shutdown and retirement of AES Redondo Beach’s remaining OTC generating units to December 31, 2021 (the “AES Redondo Beach Extension”). In October 2020, the cities of Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach filed a state court lawsuit challenging the AES Redondo Beach Extension. AES opposed the action and the court granted an order dismissing the matter. The case remains open subject to the resolution of counter claims between parties other than AES. Plaintiffs have initiated an additional challenge to the permit, and the outcome of that lawsuit is unclear. On March 16, 2021 the SACCWIS released their draft 2021 report to SWRCB. The report summarizes the State of California’s current electrical grid reliability needs and recommended a two-year extension to the compliance schedule for AES Redondo Beach to address system-wide grid reliability needs. The SWRCB public hearing regarding the final decision on the amendment of the OTC policy was held on October 19, 2021 and the Board voted in favor of extending the compliance date for AES Redondo Beach to December 31, 2023.

        "text": "permit has been administratively extended. On September 30, 2022, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures approved a recommendation to the SWRCB to consider an extension of the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC, to December 31, 2026, in support of grid reliability. SWRCB released a draft OTC Policy amendment early in 2023 to be heard by the SWRCB on March 7, 2023. The final decision from SWRCB is expected during the second half of 2023. \nPower plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. \nChallenges to the federal EPA's rule were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of the rule was not stayed while the challenges proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the rule. The Second Circuit later denied a petition by environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. \nWater Discharges — In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"the agencies\") published a rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S., known as the \"Waters of the U.S.\" (WOTUS) rule. This rule, which initially became effective in August 2015, could expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to CWA permitting. However, after repealing the 2015 WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019, the agencies, on April 21, 2020, issued the final “Navigable Waters Protection” (NWP) rule which again revised the definition of waters of the U.S. On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and remanding the NWP Rule. This vacatur of the NWP Rule applies nationwide. As such, the agencies again interpreted waters of the U.S. consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime. On January 18, 2023, the Agencies published a final rule to define the scope of waters regulated under the CWA. The rule restores regulations defining WOTUS that were in place prior to 2015, with updates intended to be consistent with relevant Supreme Court decisions. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on a wetlands case (Sackett v. EPA) on the limited question of: “Whether the Ninth Circuit set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are ‘waters of the United States’ under the Clean Water Act.” The Ninth Circuit employed Justice Kennedy’s “significant nexus” test from the 2006 Rapanos v. United States decision; the plurality opinion in Rapanos required a water body to have a \"continuous surface connection\" with a water of the United States in order to be considered a wetland covered by the CWA. In Sackett v. EPA, the Court may finally provide clarity on which test from the 2006 Rapanos decision controls. It is too early to determine whether the newly promulgated NWP rule or any outcome of litigation may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \nIn November 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas desulfurization wastewater. However, it is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nOn April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui case related to whether a CWA permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. The Court held that discharges to groundwater require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. A number of legal cases relevant to determination of \"functional equivalent\" are ongoing in various jurisdictions. It is too early to determine whether the Supreme Court decision or the result of litigation to \"functional equivalent\" may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \nSelenium Rule — In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in fresh water. NPDES permits may be updated to include selenium water quality-based effluent limits based on a site-specific evaluation process, which includes determining if there is a reasonable potential to exceed the revised final selenium water quality standards for the specific receiving water body utilizing actual and/or project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges."

        "text": "However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. AES Indiana would seek recovery of these capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee it would be successful in this regard. \nWaste Management — On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements, and post-closure care. The 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (\"WIN Act\") includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. If this rule is finalized before Indiana or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit program, AES CCR units in those locations could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA. On December 21, 2022, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management published in the Indiana Register a Second Notice of Comment Period for its proposed CCR rulemaking which would include regulation of CCR through a state permitting program. \nThe EPA has indicated that it will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule, which is ongoing. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published the CCR Part A Rule, that, among other amendments, required certain CCR units to cease waste receipt and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The CCR Part A Rule also allowed for extensions of the April 11, 2021 deadline if the EPA determines certain criteria are met. Facilities seeking such an extension were required to submit a demonstration to the EPA by November 30, 2020. On January 11, 2022, the EPA released its first in a series of proposed and final determinations regarding nine CCR Part A Rule demonstrations. On April 8, 2022, petitions for review were filed challenging these EPA actions. The petitions are consolidated in Electric Energy, Inc. v. EPA. Also on January 11, 2022,, the EPA issued four compliance-related letters notifying certain other facilities of their compliance obligations under the federal CCR regulations. The determinations and letters include interpretations regarding implementation of the CCR Rule. It is too early to determine the direct or indirect impact of these letters or any determinations that may be made. \nOn January 2, 2020, Puerto Rico Senate Bill 1221 was signed by the Puerto Rico Governor into law and became effective as Act 5-2020. Act 5-2020 prohibits the disposal and unencapsulated beneficial use of CCR and places restrictions on storage of CCR in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources developed implementation regulations which became effective on June 10, 2021. Prior to Act 5-2020's approval, the Company had put in place arrangements to dispose or beneficially use its coal ash and combustion residual outside of Puerto Rico. It is too early to determine whether this might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nThe CCR rule, current or proposed amendments to the federal CCR rule or state/territory CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring data, or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. AES Indiana would seek recovery of any resulting expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard. \n# \nFor a discussion of the material environmental regulations applicable to the Company's businesses located outside of the U.S., see Environmental Regulation under the discussion of the various countries in which the Company's subsidiaries operate in Item 1.—Business, under the applicable SBUs. \n# \nWe sell to a wide variety of customers.

The AES Corporation is led and managed by our Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Leadership Team with the guidance and oversight of our Board of Directors. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 9,100 full time/permanent employees. The following chart lists our full time/permanent employees by SBU: \n# \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $32\\%$ of our U.S. employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from 2023 to 2026. In addition, certain employees in non-U.S. locations were subject to collective bargaining agreements, representing approximately $60\\%$ of the non-U.S. workforce. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. \n# \nAt AES, safety is one of our core values. Conducting safe operations at our facilities around the world, so that each person can return home safely, is the cornerstone of our daily activities and decisions. Safety efforts are led by our Chief Operating Officer and supported by safety committees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. \nAES has established a Safety Management System (“SMS”) Global Safety Standard that applies to all AES employees, as well as contractors working in AES facilities and construction projects. The SMS requires continuous safety performance monitoring, risk assessment, and performance of periodic integrated environmental, health, and safety audits. The SMS provides a consistent framework for all AES operational businesses and construction projects to set expectations for risk identification and reduction, measure performance, and drive continuous improvements. The SMS standard is consistent with the OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 standard, and during 2022 approximately $52\\%$ of our locations have elected to formally certify their SMS to the OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 international standard. AES calculates lost time incident (“LTI”) rates for our employees and contractors based on OSHA standards, based on 200,000 labor hours, which equates to 100 workers who work 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. In 2022, there was a $10\\%$ decrease in LTI cases. In 2022, AES’ LTI Rate was 0.162 for AES People, 0.018 for operational contractors, and 0.055 for construction contractors. In 2022, the Company had two contractor work-related fatalities. \n# \nWe believe AES’ success depends on its ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. The skills, experience, and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We have a comprehensive approach to managing our talent and developing our leaders in order to ensure our people have the right skills for today and tomorrow, whether that requires us to build new business models or leverage leading technologies."

Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.— Risk Factors include risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n# \n# \nWe are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including: \nchanges in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber-attacks or other similar occurrences; and changes in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. \nOur businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. \nIn addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago and may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants requires periodic upgrading, improvement or repair and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts, due to disruption of the supply chain or other factors, may impact the ability of our plants to perform. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties. \nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans, and specific programs supported by quality control systems, which may not prevent the occurrence and impact of these risks. \nIn addition, our battery storage operations also involve risks associated with lithium-ion batteries. On rare occasions, lithium-ion batteries can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion batteries. While more recent design developments for our storage projects seek to minimize the impact of such events, these events are inherent risks of our battery storage operations."

See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurance that the outcomes of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. \n# \nA significant amount of our revenue is generated in developing countries and we intend to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES or its customers have an existing presence. International operations, particularly in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including: \n• economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;   \n• adverse changes in currency exchange rates;   \n· government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;   \n• unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;   \n• high inflation and monetary fluctuations;   \n• restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas or other raw materials;   \n• threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;   \n• unexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals;   \n• unexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries; failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or other applicable anti-bribery regulations;   \n• unwillingness of governments, agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor contracts; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to AES and less beneficial to government or private party counterparties, against those counterparties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy and tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions; difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and inability to attract and retain qualified personnel. \nDeveloping projects in less developed economies also entails greater financing risks and such financing may only be available from multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies that require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereignrelated risks. There can be no assurance that project financing will be available or that, once secured, will provide similar terms or flexibility as would be expected from a commercial lender. \nFurther, our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, politica instability and currency devaluations, which may increase the uncertainty of cash flows from these businesses. \nAny of these factors could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nOur businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets. \nSome of our businesses sell or buy electricity in the spot markets when they operate at levels that differ from their power sales agreements or retail load obligations or when they do not have any powers sales agreements. Our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets.

Consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity. \nVolatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things: \nplant availability in the markets generally;   \navailability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;   \ncompetition and new entrants;   \nseasonality, hydrology and other weather conditions;   \nilliquid markets;   \ntransmission, transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;   \nrenewables source contribution to the supply stack;   \nincreased adoption of distributed generation;   \nenergy efficiency and demand side resources;   \navailable supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;   \ngenerating unit performance;   \nnatural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, pandemics and other catastrophic events;   \nenergy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;   \ngeneral economic conditions that impact demand and energy consumption; and bidding behavior and market bidding rules. \nWholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for future growth. \nThe wholesale prices offered for electricity have been volatile in the markets in which we operate due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, low-priced natural gas and demand side management. The levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind generation sources has decreased substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have declined, while wind and solar capacity factors have increased. These renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs, while only operating during certain periods of time (daylight) or weather conditions (higher winds). This, combined with changes in oil, gas, and coal pricing, has led to increasingly volatile electricity markets across our markets. Also, in many markets, new PPAs have been awarded for renewable generation at prices significantly lower than those awarded just a few years ago. \nThis trend of volatility in wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell or buy power into the spot market to serve our contracts or will seek to sell power into the spot market once our contracts expire. \nAdverse economic developments in China could have a negative impact on demand for electricity in many of our markets. \nThe Chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past decade. Many of these commodities are produced in our key electricity markets. After experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China’s economy has experienced decreasing foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a significant slowdown in recent years. U.S. tariffs have also had a negative impact on China's economic growth. Further, China's Zero COVID strategy contributed to a significant decrease in GDP growth in 2022. The impact of the recent loosening of that strategy is uncertain at this time. Continued slowing in China’s economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. \n# \nPower generation, distribution and transmission involves hazardous activities. We may become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Furthermore,"

        "text": "through AGIC, AES’ captive insurance company, we take certain insurance risk on our businesses. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance it will be sufficient or effective in light of all circumstances, hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In particular, the availability of insurance for coal-fired generation assets has decreased as certain insurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets. Certain insurers have also withdrawn from insuring hydroelectric assets. We cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the amounts or on terms similar to our current policies. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as natural catastrophes, equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not adequately covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects. \n# \nMany of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our longterm power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. \nWe have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations; however, many of our customers do not have or have not maintained, investment-grade credit ratings. Our generation businesses cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government may not have an investment grade credit rating. We have also located our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective. \n# \nWind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. In particular, in the U.S., AES’ renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal, state and local government policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy generation projects, including investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-intariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions. If these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or AES is unable to use them, there could be a material adverse impact on AES’ U.S. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future PPAs or lower prices in future PPAs, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing. \nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s investigation into the antidumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia has reached a preliminary determination that circumvention occurred. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that circumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers were manufactured outside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically"

        "text": "identified components were produced in China. These preliminary determinations could be modified and final determinations from Commerce are expected in May 2023. \nIf the final determinations result in additional taxes, tariffs, duties, or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, such as antidumping and countervailing duty rates, such developments could impede the realization of our U.S. renewables strategy by resulting in, among other items, lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of our U.S. renewable energy projects, abandoning the development of certain U.S. renewable energy projects, a loss of our investments in the projects, and/or reduced project returns. \nFurthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer. These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource. \nAs a result, these types of projects face considerable risk, including that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. At the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed-price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop or obtain third-party financing for these projects. \nFurther, in the U.S., the tax credits associated with certain renewables projects are earned when the project is placed in service. Delays in xecuting our renewables projects can result in delays in recognizing those tax credits and adversely impact our short-term financial results. \nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n# \nWe are in various stages of developing and constructing renewables projects and power plants. Certain of these projects have signed longterm contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion of the development of these projects depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, interconnection and transmission, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, supply chain related disruptions to our access to materials, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Objections of or challenges by local communities or interest groups may delay or impede permitting for our development projects. \nIn certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though they have not yet secured financing, PPAs, or other important elements for a successful project. For example, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment without having financing, a PPA or critical permits in place (or enter into a PPA, procurement agreement or other agreement without agreed financing). \nIf the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may retain certain liabilities. Furthermore, we may undertake significant development costs and subsequently not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will reach commercial operation. If development efforts are not successful, we may abandon certain projects, resulting in, writing off the costs incurred, expensing related capitalized development costs incurred and incurring additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. \n# \nAcquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy historically and more recently as we grow our renewables business. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we may have limited or no history of owning and operating certain of these businesses, and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. We also may encounter challenges in integrating and realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions as well as integration or other one-time costs that are greater"

Such businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; and the rate of return from such businesses may not justify our investment of capital to acquire them. In addition, some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could impact our business and operations. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity in recent years, including electricity and energy consumption. COVID-19 or another pandemic could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to, among other factors: \n• further decline in customer demand as a result of general decline in business activity; further destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting customers’ ability to pay for our services whe due or at all, including downstream impacts, whereby the utilities’ customers are unable to pay monthly bills or receiving a moratorium from payment obligations, resulting in inability on the part of utilities to make payments for power supplied by our generation companies decline in business activity causing our commercial and industrial customers to experience declining revenues and liquidity difficulties that impede their ability to pay for power that we supply; government moratoriums or other regulatory or legislative actions that limit changes in pricing, delay or suspend customers’ payment obligations or permit extended payment terms applicable to customers of our utilities or to our offtakers under power purchase agreements, in particular, to the extent that such measures are not mitigated by associated government subsidies or other support to address any shortfall or deficiencies in payments;   \n• claims by our PPA counterparties for delay or relief from payment obligations or other adjustments, including claims based on force majeure or other legal grounds;   \n• further decline in spot electricity prices;   \n• the destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting our customer growth in our service territories at our utilities; negative impacts on the health of our essential personnel and on our operations as a result of implementing stay-at-home, quarantine, curfew and other social distancing measures; delays or inability to access, transport and deliver fuel to our generation facilities due to restrictions on business operations or other factors affecting us and our third-party suppliers; delays or inability to access equipment or the availability of personnel to perform planned and unplanned maintenance or disruptions in supply chain, which can, in turn, lead to disruption in operations; a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity, including increased cybersecurity attacks related to the work-from-home environment;   \n• further delays to our construction projects, including at our renewables projects, and the timing of the completion of renewables projects   \n• delay or inability to receive the necessary permits for our development projects due to delays or shutdowns of government operations;   \n• delays in achieving our financial goals, strategy and digital transformation; deterioration of the credit profile of The AES Corporation and/or its subsidiaries and difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets o favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis;   \n• delays or inability to complete asset sales on anticipated terms or to redeploy capital as set forth in our capital allocation plans;   \n• increased volatility in foreign exchange and commodity markets;   \n• deterioration of economic conditions, demand and other related factors resulting in impairments to long-lived assets; and"

A resurgence or material worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic could present material uncertainty that could adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, development projects, energy storage sales by Fluence, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten many of the other risks described in this section. \n# \nThe power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, or greater than, ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. In addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition. \n# \nWe often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders. Further, our suppliers may source certain materials from areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause delays and/or disruptions to our development projects or operations. \nThe financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under longterm agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. Furthermore, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing PPA under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in Puerto Rico. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, and may have to sell power at market prices. A counterparty's breach by of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including the affected businesses debt agreements. Any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n# \nEmerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards.

If we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n# \nOur business relies on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. In particular, there has been an increased focus on the U.S. energy grid believed to be related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach may: \nimpact our operations, revenue, strategic objectives, customer and vendor relationships; expose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings; require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future attacks;   \nimpair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities; and impact our financial and accounting systems and, subsequently, our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. \nWe have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. To date, cyber-attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies as well as those for third-party providers. We cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures will prevent future cyberattacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any losses we may experience. Further, we do not control certain of joint ventures or our equity method investments and cannot guarantee that their efforts will be effective. \n# \nOur businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales based on best available information and expectations for weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. \nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected. In addition,"

Additionally, our contracts in certain markets where hydroelectric facilities are prevalent may require us to purchase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate at anticipated levels and the price of such spot power may increase substantially in times of low hydrology. \n# \nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energyrelated commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, dam failures and tsunamis can be destructive and could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages and property damage, reducing revenue, affecting the availability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. Our power plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, including heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal levels of precipitation resulting in river and coastal urban floods in North America or reduced water availability and increased flooding across Central and South America, and changes in coast lines due to sea level change. \nDepending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhouse gases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Such incidents may also impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers. \nA disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. At our businesses where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred.

However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. In some joint venture agreements in which we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting minority rights to the other shareholders. \nThe approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions that are different from the decisions we would make and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures.

As a publicly listed company, Fluence is governed by its own Board of Directors, whose members have fiduciary duties to the Fluence shareholders. While we have certain rights to appoint representatives to the Fluence Board of Directors, the interests of the Fluence shareholders, as represented by the Fluence Board of Directors, may not align with our interests or the interests of our securityholders. As of December 31, 2022, Fluence continues to report that a material weakness in its internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory has not yet been remediated. Such material weakness can impact the reliability of the Fluence financial information that we may include as part of our financial information. \nIn addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influence and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. The management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n# \nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our foreign operations expenses are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. \n# \nWe routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with \"basis risk,\" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations. \n# \nCustomer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by external factors, including mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic"

Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements.

The impacts described above could also result from our efforts to comply with European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower operating margins and financial results for the affected businesses. \nSeveral of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR. \nCCR generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites, is currently handled and/or has been handled by: placement in onsite CCR ponds; disposal and beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications, including encapsulated uses and structural fill; and used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. CCR currently remains onsite at several of our facilities, including in CCR ponds. The EPA's final CCR rule provides that enforcement actions can be commenced by the EPA, states, or territories, and private lawsuits. Compliance with the U.S. federal CCR rule; amendments to the federal CCR rule; or federal, state, territory, or foreign rules or programs addressing CCR may require us to incur substantial costs. In addition, the Company and our businesses may face CCR-related lawsuits in the United States and/or internationally that may expose us to unexpected potential liabilities. Furthermore, CCR-related litigation may also expose us to unexpected costs. In addition, CCR, and its production at several of our facilities, have been the subject of significant interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and have received national and local media attention. The direct and indirect effects of such media attention, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may divert management time and attention. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects. \n# \nThe AES Corporation is a registered electric holding company under the PUHCA 2005 as enacted as part of the EPAct 2005. PUHCA 2005 eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, while continuing to provide FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. PUHCA 2005 also creates additional potential challenges and opportunities. By removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies is more likely. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S. \nOther parts of the EPAct 2005 allow FERC to remove the PURPA purchase/sale obligations from utilities if there are adequate opportunities to sell into competitive markets. FERC has exercised this power with a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of MISO, PJM, ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., and ERCOT are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. Additionally, FERC has the power to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a caseby-case basis. While these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our QFs that have had sales contracts expire are now facing a more difficult market environment and that is likely to continue for other AES QFs with existing contracts that will expire over time. \nFERC strongly encourages competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of generation assets. Similarly, FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission"

Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also ncrease the competition in our existing markets. \nFERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. As a result, FERC is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute and such penalty authority has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past. \nPursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the ERO to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Violations of NERC reliability standards are subject to FERC's penalty authority under the FPA and EPAct 2005. \nOur U.S. utility businesses face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1.—Business—US and Utilities SBU. \n# \nOur businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any associated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. For example, in recent years, the EPA has issued NOVs to a number of coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies for allegedly making major modifications to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available control technology. The primary focus of these NOVs has been emissions of $\\mathsf{S O}_{2}$ and ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\mathsf{x}}$ and the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce such emissions. In addition, state regulatory agencies and nongovernmental environmental organizations have pursued civil lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring the installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units. \nFurthermore, Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. See Item 1.— Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations. \nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected."

        "text": "# \nInternational, federal and various regional and state authorities regulate GHG emissions and have created financial incentives to reduce them. In 2022, the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses that had total $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions of approximately 40 million metric tonnes, approximately 15 million of which were emitted by our U.S. businesses (both figures are ownership adjusted). The Company uses $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission estimation methodologies supported by \"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission factors. This estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. While actual emissions may vary substantially; the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. \nThere currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled electric utility steam generating units larger than $25\\mathsf{M W}$ and in 2018 proposed revisions to the rule. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule which establishes heat rate improvement measures as the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to the EPA the ACE Rule, but withheld issuance of the mandate that would effectuate its decision. On February 22, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA's unopposed motion for a partial stay of the issuance of the mandate on vacating the repeal of the CPP. On March 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit issued the partial mandate effectuating the vacatur of the ACE Rule. In effect, the CPP did not take effect while the EPA is addressing the remand of the ACE rule by promulgating a new Section 111(d) rule to regulate greenhouse gases from existing electric generating units. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions to review the decision by the D.C. Circuit to vacate the ACE Rule. On June 30, 2022, Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The opinion held that the “generation shifting” approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to EPA by Congress under Section 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C. Circuit recalled its March 5, 2021 partial mandate and issued a new partial mandate holding pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while EPA develops a replacement rule. The impact of the results of further proceedings and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material. The impact of the results of such litigation and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material. \nIn 2010, the EPA adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new and existing sources of GHG emissions to potentially obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such permitting would only be required if such sources also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regulated pollutants. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emissions, see Item 1.—Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations—U.S. Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations—Greenhouse Gas Emissions above. The Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Paris Agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below ${}^{2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}$ above pre-industrial levels. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to decarbonize the global economy and to further limit GHG emissions. The impact of GHG regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. The costs of compliance could be substantial. \nOur non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions to contract counterparties. Likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions to customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or"

Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at our electric power transmission and distribution assets and facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity, would also be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease our revenues. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. \nIn addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments. \nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets. \nIn addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits that were dismissed against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions. Future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. We may also be subject to risks associated with the impact on weather conditions. See Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology and Severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results within this section for more information. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and reputation. \n# \nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identifiable information about customers, employees, customer energy usage and other information as well as information regarding business partners and other third parties, some of which may constitute confidential information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data collected by us can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. Although we maintain technical and organizational measures to protect personal identifiable information and other confidential information, breaches of, or disruptions to, our information technology systems could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business. \nWe are also subject to various data privacy and security laws and regulations globally, as well as contractual requirements, as a result of having access to and processing confidential and personal identifiable information in the course of business. If we are unable to comply with applicable laws and regulations or with our contractual commitments, as well as maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, any actual or perceived failure on the part of one of our equity affiliates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and prospects."

From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely impact our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes, our effective tax rate or tax payments. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. The IRA includes provisions that are expected to benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions and/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage and hydrogen projects. We expect that the extension of the current solar investment tax credits (\"ITCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, will increase demand for our renewables products. In the U.S., the IRA includes a $15\\%$ corporate alternative minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income. We are currently evaluating the applicability and effect of the new law and additional guidance issued in the fourth quarter of 2022. \nWith respect to international tax reform, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the European Commission adopted an amended Directive on Pillar 2 establishing a global minimum tax at a $15\\%$ rate. The adoption requires EU Member States to transpose the Directive into their respective national laws by December 31, 2023, for the rules to come into effect as of January 1, 2024. We will continue to monitor issuance of draft legislation in Bulgaria and other relevant EU Member States. The Impact to the Company remains unknown but may be material. \n# \n# \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $\\$23$ billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility are unsecured. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. A substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This level of indebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including: \nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; reducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and limiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. \nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements may be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11—Debt included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities. \nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. \nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face various"

Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. \n# \nWe attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects through non-recourse debt or \"non-recourse financing\" that requires the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $\\$23$ billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $\\$3.9$ billion was recourse debt of the Parent Company and approximately $\\$19.4$ billion was non-recourse debt. In some non-recourse financings, the Parent Company has explicitly agreed, in the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. \nCertain of our subsidiaries are in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $\\$177$ million as of December 31, 2022. While the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, such defaults under non-recourse financings can: \n• reduce the Parent Company's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash because a subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the pendency of any default;   \ntrigger The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; trigger defaults in the Parent Company's outstanding debt. For example, The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries and relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or result in foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse financings, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets. \nNone of the projects that are in default are owned by subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, meet the applicable standard of materiality in The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility or other debt agreements to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other changes to our financial position and results of operations, one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of Parent Company indebtedness. \n# \nThe AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: principal repayments of debt, interest, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions, construction and other project commitments, other equity commitments (including business development investments); equity repurchases; taxes and Parent Company overhead costs. Our principal sources of liquidity are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, proceeds from financings at the Parent Company, and proceeds from asset sales. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis — Capital Resources and Liquidity. We believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future, based on a number of material assumptions about access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions; however, there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected.

Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic and capital market conditions; the availability of bank credit; the availability of tax equity partners; the financial condition, performance and prospects of AES as well as our competitors; and changes in tax and securities laws. Should access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or cease further investments, including the expansion or improvement of existing facilities, any of which would affect our future growth. \nA downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our access to the capital markets, interest expense, liquidity or cash flow. \nIf any of the credit ratings of the The AES Corporation and its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. Furthermore, counterparties may no longer be willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support.

The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia (“CEEE”), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES Florestal communicated with Brazilian authorities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, the State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil action against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order requiring the companies to mitigate the contaminated area located on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximately $\\mathsf{R}\\$6$ million $\\$1$ million). In October 2011, the State Attorney filed a request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove the contamination immediately.

The CCC has asserted that AES Redondo Beach has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in violation of the California Coastal Act and Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program. Potential outcomes of the CCC determination could include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to perform a restoration and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it has meritorious arguments concerning the underlying CCC determination, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful.

On May 26, 2020, CCC staff sent AES a NOV directing AES to submit a Coastal Development Permit (“CDP”) application for the removal of the water pumps within the alleged wetlands. AES has submitted the CDP to the permitting authority, the City of Redondo Beach (“the City”), with respect to AES’ plans to disable or remove the pumps. The NOV also directed AES to submit technical analysis regarding additional water pumps located within onsite electrical vaults and a CDP application for their continued operation. AES has responded to the CCC, providing the requested analysis and seeking further discussion with the agency regarding the CDP. On October 14, 2020, the City deemed the CDP application to be complete and indicated a public hearing will be required, at which time AES must present additional information and analysis on the pumps within the alleged wetlands and the onsite electrical vaults. \nIn October 2015, AES Indiana received an NOV alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), the Indiana State Implementation Plan (“SIP”), and the Title V operating permit related to alleged particulate and opacity violations at Petersburg Station Unit 3. In addition, in February 2016, AES Indiana received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of New Source Review and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. On August 31, 2020, AES Indiana reached a settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (“IDEM”), resolving these purported violations of the CAA at Petersburg Station. The settlement agreement, in the form of a proposed judicial consent decree, was approved and entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on March 23, 2021, and includes, among other items, the following requirements: annual caps on ${\\mathsf{N O}}_{\\times}$ and ${\\mathsf{S O}}_{2}$ emissions and more stringent emissions limits than AES Indiana's current Title V air permit; payment of civil penalties totaling $\\$1.5$ million; a $\\$5$ million environmental mitigation project consisting of the construction and operation of a new, non-emitting source of generation at the site; expenditure of $\\$0.3$ million on a state-only environmentally beneficial project to preserve"

If AES Indiana does not meet the retirement obligation, it must install a Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction System (\"SNCR\") on Unit 4. \nIn October 2017, the Maritime Prosecution Office from Valparaíso issued a ruling alleging responsibility by AES Andes for the presence of coal waste on Ventanas beach, and proposed a fine before the Maritime Governor, of approximately $\\$395,000$ . AES Andes submitted its statement of defense, denying the allegations. In May 2021, AES Andes was notified of an amended Opinion of the Maritime Prosecution Office which extends the alleged liability to a third party and reduces the proposed fine to AES Andes to approximately $\\$372,000$ . On August 18, the Maritime Governor issued a resolution affirming the proposed fine, and on September 8, AES Andes filed an administrative action with the Maritime Governor requesting reconsideration of the fine. On December 28, 2021 the resolution rejecting the reinstatement appeal was notified and on January 17, 2022 AES Andes filed an appeal against that ruling. In April 2022, Puerto Ventanas requested that the Maritime Authority join this proceeding with a parallel proceeding; however, the request was rejected. In May 2022, the General Director of the Maritime Territory and Merchant Marine of the Chilean Navy rejected AES Andes’ appeal and imposed a fine of $\\$341,363$ . AES Andes will continue with administrative appeals. AES Andes believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations; however, there are no assurances it will be successful. \nIn December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, and three other AES affiliates. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 100 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands $\\$476$ million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. \nIn February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $\\$900$ million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court. Preliminary hearings have taken place and are ongoing. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. \nIn October 2019, the Superintendency of the Environment (the \"SMA\") notified AES Andes of certain alleged breaches associated with the environmental permit of the Ventanas Complex, initiating a sanctioning process through Exempt Resolution $N^{\\circ}$ 1 / ROL D-129-2019. The alleged charges include exceeding generation limits, failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality, exceeding limits on discharges to the sea, and exceeding noise limits. AES Andes has submitted a proposed “Compliance Program” to the SMA for the Ventanas Complex. The latest version of this Compliance Program was submitted on May 26, 2021. On December 30, 2021, the Compliance Program was approved by the SMA. However an ex officio action was brought by the SMA due to alleged exceedances of generation limits, which would require the Company to reduce SO2, NOx and PM emissions in order to achieve the emissions offset established in the Compliance Program. On January 6, 2022, AES Andes filed a reposition with the SMA seeking modification of the means for compliance with the ex officio action. On January 17, 2023, the SMA approved street paving measures, or alternatively a program providing heaters for community members, as the means to satisfy the air emissions offsets in the approved Compliance Plan. Fines are possible if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of the Compliance Program. The cost of proposed Compliance Program is approximately $\\$10.8$ million. \nIn March 2020, Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electricidad ${\\big(}^{\\mathrm{{*}}}\\mathrm{CFE}^{\\mathrm{{*}}}{\\big)}$ served an arbitration demand upon AES Mérida III. CFE makes allegations that AES Mérida III is in breach of its obligations under a power and capacity purchase agreement (“Contract”) between the two parties, which allegations related to CFE’s own failure to provide fuel within the specifications of the Contract. CFE seeks to recover approximately $\\$200$ million in payments made to AES Mérida under the Contract as well as approximately $\\$480$ million in alleged damages for having to acquire"

AES Mérida has filed an answer denying liability to CFE and asserting a counterclaim for damages due to CFE’s breach of its obligations. The parties submitted their respective initial briefs and supporting evidence in December 2020. After additional briefing, the evidentiary hearing took place in November 2021. Closing arguments were heard in May 2022. In November 2022, the arbitration Tribunal issued its decision in the case, rejecting CFE’s claims for damages and granting AES Mérida a net amount of damages on AES Mérida’s counterclaims. It is unclear whether CFE will comply with the decision or will attempt to challenge it. AES Mérida believes that it has meritorious defenses and claims and will assert them vigorously in this dispute; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. \nOn May 12, 2021, the Mexican Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (the “Authority”) initiated an environmental audit at the Termoelectrica del Golfo (“TEG”) and Termoelectrica del Peñoles (“TEP”) thermal generating facilities. On July 15, 2022, TEG was notified of the resolution issued by the Authority, which alleges breaches of air emission regulations, including failure to submit reports. The resolution imposes a fine of $\\$8,467,360$ pesos (approximately USD $\\$400,000$ . The facility filed a nullity judgment to challenge the resolution, and on September 8, 2022, a provisional injunction was granted by the Tribunal, subject to TEG’s presentation of a warranty, which could include a corporate guaranty or bail. The provisional injunction temporarily suspends the obligation to pay the fine while the Tribunal considers a definitive injunction, and potentially, a sentence dismissing the fine. On December 2, 2022, TEG presented a bail as guarantee for the injunction, which was rejected by the local tax authority. TEG challenged the tax authority's denial through an amparo claim on January 10, 2023. No resolution for TEP’s audit has been issued, and on September 9, 2022, TEP filed an amparo claim challenging the inaction of the Authority on the environmental audit. The amparo claim was admitted on October 17, 2022. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. \nIn February 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 425 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $\\$600$ million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify or provide any supporting information concerning the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. \nOn July 25, 2022, AES Puerto Rico, LP (“AES-PR”) received from the EPA an NOV alleging certain violations of the CAA at AES-PR’s coalfired power facility in Guayama, Puerto Rico. The NOV alleges AES-PR exceeded an emission limit and did not continuously operate certain monitoring equipment, conduct certain analyses and testing, maintain complete records, and submit certain reports as required by the EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The NOV further alleges AES-PR did not comply fully with the facility’s Title V operating permit. AES-PR is engaging in discussions with the EPA about the NOV. AES-PR will defend its interests, but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of CAA claims alleged against other coal-fired power plants have required companies to pay civil penalties and undertake remedial measures. \nIn April 2022, the Superintendency of the Environment (the \"SMA\") notified AES Andes of certain alleged breaches associated with the construction of the Mesamávida wind project, initiating a sanctioning process. The alleged charges include untimely implementation of road improvement measures and road use schedules and the failure to identify all noise receptors closest to the first construction phases of the project. On June 23, 2022, the SMA addressed the charges to Energía Eólica Mesamávida SpA. On June 28, 2022, Energía Eólica Mesamávida SpA submitted a proposed compliance program, with an estimated cost of $\\$4.3$ million, which was subsequently approved by the SMA. On November 9, 2022, opponents to the project submitted before the Third Environmental Court a judicial action challenging the approval of this compliance program. If the third-party appeal is successful or if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of this compliance program, fines are possible. AES Andes believes that it has meritorious defenses to the third-party challenge and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. \nIn September 2022, the SMA initiated sanctioning proceedings against the Cochrane Power Station on four alleged charges, including one instance of noncompliance categorized as “serious” with the Environmental Qualification Resolution (RCA). The allegations included structural and monitoring deficiencies, as well as an unauthorized underwater outfall discharging from the facility. On December 12, 2022, AES Andes submitted a"

The impairment analysis was triggered by the signing of a purchase and sale agreement which, at the time, implied an expected loss upon sale of the Company's indirect interest in a portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\"). The transaction closed on February 28, 2023. sPower primarily holds operating assets where the tax credits associated with underlying projects have already been allocated to tax equity partners. The application of HLBV accounting increases the carrying value of these investments, as earnings are initially disproportionately allocated to the sponsor entity. Since sPower does not have any ongoing development or other value creation activities following the transfer of these activities to AES Clean Energy Development, the impairment adjusts the carrying value to the fair market value of the operating assets. See Note 25—Acquisitions included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the formation of AES Clean Energy Development. \nThere was no other non-operating expense in 2021. \nOther non-operating expense was $\\$202$ million in 2020 due to the other-than-temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment. In December 2019, an other-than-temporary impairment was recorded for OPGC primarily due to the estimated market value of the Company's investment and other negative developments impacting future expected cash flows at the investee. In March 2020, the Company recognized an additional $\\$43$ million other-than-temporary impairment due to the economic slowdown.

        "text": "The 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the current year nondeductible goodwill impairments at AES Andes and AES El Salvador, as well as the current year asset impairment of the Maritza coal-fired plant. These impacts were partially offset by favorable LNG transactions at certain MCAC businesses and inflationary and foreign currency impacts at certain Argentine businesses recognized in 2022. The 2021 effective tax rate was impacted by the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo and the asset impairment at Puerto Rico. These impacts were partially offset by the income tax benefit related to effective settlement resulting from the exam closure of the Company’s U.S. 2017 tax return. Additionally offsetting the 2021 impacts was the benefit associated with the release of valuation allowance due to a change in expected realizability of net operating loss carryforwards at one of our Brazilian subsidiaries.

Further, the 2020 effective tax rate was impacted by the other-than-temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment and the loss on sale of the Company’s entire interest in AES Uruguaiana, partially offset by the recognition of a federal ITC for the Na Pua Makani wind facility in Hawaii. See Note 24—Heldfor-Sale and Dispositions included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the sale of the Company's entire interest of AES Uruguaiana. \nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate. Foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the U.S. corporate rate of $21\\%$ and are also subject to current U.S. taxation under the GILTI rule. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment.

Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities. \nAdjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as general and administrative expenses in the Corporate segment, as well as business development costs, interest expense and interest income, other expense and other income, realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and net equity in earnings of affiliates. \nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation. We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, Adjusted PTC represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results. \nAdjusted PTC should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. \nYears Ended December 31, \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{econcmatlonofAdjustedPTC(inmmmons)} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2022} \\\\\n & $ (546) $ & 2021 (413) & 2020 $ 43 \\\\\nIncome（loss)fromcontinuingoperations,netoftax,attributabletoTheAESCorporation Incometaxexpense(benefit)attributabletoTheAESCorporation & 210 & (31) & 130 \\\\\nPre-taxcontribution & (336) & (444) & 173 \\\\\nUnrealizedderivativeandequitysecuritieslosses(gains) &  &  & 3 \\\\\n & 128 & (1) \\\\\nUnrealizedforeigncurrencylosses(gains) & 42 & 14 & (10) \\\\\nDisposition/acquisitionlosses & 40 & 861 & 112 \\\\\nImpairmentlosses & 1,658 & 1,153 & 928 \\\\\nLossonextinguishmentofdebt & 35 & 91 & 223 \\\\\nNetgainsfromearlycontractterminationsatAngamos TotalAdjustedPTC $ & 1,567 $ & (256) 1,418 & (182) $ 1,247 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.—Business and Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. \n# \nTrade Restrictions and Supply Chain — On March 29, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) announced the initiation of an investigation into whether imports into the U.S. of solar cells and panels imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty orders on solar cells and panels from China. This investigation resulted in significant systemic disruptions to the import of solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued a Proclamation waiving any tariffs that result from this investigation for a 24-month period. Since President Biden’s proclamation, suppliers in Southeast Asia have imported cells and panels again to the U.S."

        "text": "On December 2, 2022, Commerce issued country-wide affirmative preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred in each of the four Southeast Asian countries. Commerce also evaluated numerous individual companies and issued preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred with respect to many but not all of these companies. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that circumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers were manufactured outside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically identified components were produced in China. These preliminary determinations could be modified and final determinations from Commerce are expected in May 2023. We have contracted and secured our expected requirements for solar panels for U.S. projects targeted to achieve commercial operations in 2023. \nAdditionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers’ ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory. \nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES’ U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic — The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have conducted our essential operations without significant disruption. We derive approximately $85\\%$ of our total revenues from our regulated utilities and long-term sales and supply contracts or PPAs at our generation businesses, which contributes to a relatively stable revenue and cost structure at most of our businesses. In 2022, our operational locations continued to experience the impact of, and recovery from, the COVID-19 pandemic. Across our global portfolio, our utilities businesses have generally performed in line with our expectations consistent with a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Also see Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. \nEstí Hydro Plant Flooding Incident — On September 30, 2022, there was a flooding incident that impacted Estí, a 120 MW hydro plant in Panama. The plant was taken out of service for a complete assessment of the damages, which has now been completed. Repairs will be needed to ensure the long-term performance of the facility. During this time, the plant will continue to be out of service. The plant is covered by business interruption and property damage insurance and, in December 2022, a partial settlement was reached with the insurer. \nThe Company has not identified any indicators of impairment and believes the carrying value of the plant of $\\$130$ million is recoverable as of December 31, 2022. \n# \nThe macroeconomic and political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2022. This could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. See Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further information. \nInflation Reduction Act and U.S. Renewable Energy Tax Credits — The Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. The IRA includes provisions that are expected to benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions and/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage and hydrogen projects. We expect that the extension of the current solar investment tax credits (\"ITCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, will increase demand for our renewables products. \nOur U.S. renewables business has a 51 GW pipeline that we intend to utilize to continue to grow our business, and these changes in tax policy are supportive of this strategy. We account for U.S. renewables projects according to U.S. GAAP, which, when partnering with tax-equity investors to monetize tax benefits, utilizes the HLBV method. This method recognizes the tax-credit value that is transferred to tax equity partners at the time of its creation, which for projects utilizing the investment tax credit is in the quarter the project begins commercial operation. For projects utilizing the production tax credit, this value is recognized over 10 years as the facility produces energy. In 2022, we"

        "text": "realized $\\$246$ million of Adjusted PTC from tax credits earned by our U.S. renewables business. In 2023, we expect to realize significantly increased amounts of Adjusted PTC from tax credits earned by our U.S. renewables business in line with the growth in that business. Based on construction schedules, a significant portion of these earnings will be realized in the fourth quarter. \nThe implementation of the IRA is expected to require substantial guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury and other government agencies. While that guidance is pending, there will be uncertainty with respect to the implementation of certain provisions of the IRA. \nGlobal Tax — The macroeconomic and political environments in the U.S. and in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2021 and 2022. This could result in significant impacts to tax law. For example, on July 1, 2022, the Chilean government proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate from $27\\%$ to $25\\%$ , limit net operating loss utilization per year, and introduce a disintegrated system whereby dividends may be subject to a $22\\%$ withholding tax, among other changes. The potential impact to the Company may be material. \nIn the U.S., the IRA includes a $15\\%$ corporate alternative minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income. We are currently valuating the applicability and effect of the new law and additional guidance issued in the fourth quarter of 2022. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the European Commission adopted an amended Directive on Pillar 2 establishing a global minimum tax at a $15\\%$ rate. The adoption requires EU Member States to transpose the Directive into their respective national laws by December 31, 2023 for the rules to come into effect as of January 1, 2024. We will continue to monitor issuance of draft legislation in Bulgaria and other relevant EU Member States. The impact to the Company remains unknown but may be material. \nInflation — In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation recently. While most of our contracts in our international businesses are indexed to inflation, in general, our U.S.-based generation contracts are not indexed to inflation. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of some of our development projects that could negatively impact their competitiveness. Our utility businesses do allow for recovering of operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, which may have timing impacts on recovery. \nReference Rate Reform — In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. The ICE Benchmark Association (\"IBA\") has determined that it will cease publication of the one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates by June 30, 2023. AES holds a substantial amount of debt and derivative contracts referencing LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark. In order to facilitate an organized transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), AES has established a process to measur and mitigate risks associated with the cessation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, assessed, and implemented for newly executed agreements. Many of AES’ existing agreements include provisions designed to facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR, and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the adoption of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. To the extent that the terms of the credit agreements and derivative instruments do not align following the cessation of LIBOR rates, AES negotiates contract amendments with counterparties or additional derivatives contracts. \nPuerto Rico — Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long-term PPAs with state-owned PREPA, which has been facing economic challenges that could result in a material adverse effect on our business in Puerto Rico. Despite the Title III protection, PREPA has been making substantially all of its payments to the generators in line with historical payment patterns. \nThe Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) was enacted to create a structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of U.S. territories and created procedures for adjusting debt accumulated by the Puerto Rico government and, potentially, other territories (“Title III”). PROMESA also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in Puerto Rico. \nPROMESA allowed for the establishment of an Oversight Board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over Puerto Rico. Th Oversight Board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA under Title III in July 2017."

        "text": "As a result of the bankruptcy filing, AES Puerto Rico and AES Ilumina’s non-recourse debt of $\\$143$ million and $\\$27$ million, respectively, continue to be in technical default and are classified as current as of December 31, 2022. The Company is in compliance with its debt payment obligations as of December 31, 2022. \nOn April 12, 2022, a mediation team was appointed to prepare the plan to resolve the PREPA Title III case and related proceedings. A disclosure statement hearing was held on February 28, 2023; the PREPA disclosure statement was approved and mediation was extended through April 28, 2023. \nConsidering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in Puerto Ric of $\\$96$ million is recoverable as of December 31, 2022. \n# \nOur strategy involves shifting towards clean energy platforms, including renewable energy, energy storage, LNG, and modernized grids. It is designed to position us for continued growth while reducing our carbon intensity and in support of our mission of accelerating the future of energy, together. In February 2022, we announced our intent to exit coal generation by year-end 2025, subject to necessary approvals. \nIn addition, initiatives have been announced by regulators, including in Chile, Puerto Rico, Bulgaria and Hawaii, and offtakers in recent years, with the intention of reducing GHG emissions generated by the energy industry. In parallel, the shift towards renewables has caused certain customers to migrate to other low-carbon energy solutions and this trend may continue. \nAlthough we cannot currently estimate the financial impact of these decarbonization initiatives, new legislative or regulatory programs further restricting carbon emissions or other initiatives to voluntarily exit coal generation could require material capital expenditures, resulting in reduction of the estimated useful life of certain coal facilities, or have other material adverse effects on our financial results. \nFor further information about the risks associated with decarbonization initiatives, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses included in this Form 10-K. \n# \nAES Maritza PPA Review — DG Comp is conducting a preliminary review of whether AES Maritza’s PPA with NEK is compliant with the European Union's State Aid rules. No formal investigation has been launched by DG Comp to date. However, AES Maritza has been engaging in discussions with the DG Comp case team and the Government of Bulgaria $(^{\\cdot\\cdot}G o B^{\\cdot\\cdot})$ to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution of the DG Comp’s review (\"PPA Discussions\"). The PPA Discussions are ongoing and the PPA continues to remain in place. However, there can be no assurance that, in the context of the PPA Discussions, the other parties will not seek a prompt termination of the PPA. \nWe do not believe termination of the PPA is justified. Nevertheless, the PPA Discussions involve a range of potential outcomes, including but not limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensation to AES Maritza. Any negotiated resolution would be subject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approval. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the PPA Discussions or when those discussions will conclude. Nor can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the PPA Discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning the agency's review. AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. However, there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our long-lived assets at Maritza is $\\$427$ million. \nAES Ohio Distribution Rate Case — On December 14, 2022, the PUCO issued an order on AES Ohio’s application to increase its base rates for electric distribution service to address, in part, increased costs of materials and labor and substantial investments to improve distribution structures. Among other matters, the order establishes a revenue increase of $\\$76$ million for AES Ohio’s base rates for electric distribution service. This increase will go into effect when AES Ohio has a new electric security plan in place, which is expected in 2023. \nAES Ohio Electric Security Plan — On September 26, 2022, AES Ohio filed its latest Electric Security Plan (ESP 4) with the PUCO, which is a comprehensive plan to enhance and upgrade its network and improve"

ESP 4 also seeks to recover outstanding regulatory assets not currently in rates. AES Ohio did not propose that the Rate Stabilization Charge continue under ESP 4. This plan requires PUCO approval, which is expected in 2023. \nAES Indiana Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”) — AES Indiana filed its 2022 IRP with the IURC in December 2022. The 2022 IRP includes converting the two remaining coal units at Petersburg to natural gas by the end of 2025. Additionally, AES Indiana plans to add up to 1,300 MW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage by 2027. \n# \nWe operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. For additional information, refer to Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n# \nLong-lived Assets and Equity Affiliates — During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized asset and otherthan-temporary impairment expenses of $\\$938$ million. See Note 8—Investments and Advances to Affiliates and Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. After recognizing these impairment expenses, the carrying value of our investments in equity affiliates and long-lived assets that were assessed for impairment in 2022 totaled $\\$1.5$ billion at December 31, 2022. \nEvents or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. \nGoodwill — The Company has seen degradation in certain external factors used to determine the discount rate applied in our goodwill impairment analysis, such as increasing interest rates and country risk premiums in certain markets, as well as a decrease in forecast energy prices and other unfavorable macroeconomic assumptions in Colombia. These changes to the inputs of our discount rate have negatively impacted our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022 and thus, an impairment of goodwill of $\\$77$ million has been recognized as of December 31, 2022, reducing the goodwill balances of both AES Andes and AES El Salvador to zero. See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. \nThe Company had no other reporting units considered to be “at risk,” as the fair value of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by more than $10\\%$ . Should the fair value of any of the Company’s reporting units fall below its carrying amount as a result of these inputs or other changes such as reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, regulatory changes, or other adverse conditions, goodwill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods. \n# \n# \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $\\$1.4$ billion, of which $\\$24$ million was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies. The Company had $\\$730$ million in short-term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries, and restricted cash and debt service reserves of $\\$713$ million. The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $\\$19.4$ billion and $\\$3.9$ billion, respectively. Of the $\\$1.8$ billion of our current non-recourse debt, $\\$1.6$ billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $\\$177$ million relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations.

        "text": "the bankruptcy of the offtaker. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had $\\$662$ million outstanding related to supplier financing arrangements, which are classified as Accrued and other liabilities. \nWe expect current maturities of non-recourse debt and amounts due under supplier financing arrangements to be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the liability relates, through opportunistic refinancing activity, or some combination thereof. While we have no recourse debt which matures within the next twelve months, we do have amounts due under supplier financing arrangements, of which $\\$296$ million has a Parent Company guarantee. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material. \nWe rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies, and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our nonrecourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks. \nGiven our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at least $70\\%$ of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's only material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to drawings of $\\$325$ million under its revolving credit facility and a $\\$200$ million senior unsecured term loan. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $\\$23.7$ billion of total gross debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, approximately $\\$6$ billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. Brazil holds $\\$2$ billion of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as variable rate instruments act as a natural hedge against inflation in Brazil. \nIn addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's nonrecourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support in support of tax equity partnerships or for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment, or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation or other obligation under the terms of the relevant agreement, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. As of December 31, 2022, the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $\\$2.4$ billion in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). \nSome counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had $\\$123$ million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our unsecured credit facilities, $\\$123$ million in letters of credit under bilateral agreements, and $\\$34$ million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our revolving credit facility. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development and construction activities and"

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from $1\\%$ to $3\\%$ per annum on he outstanding amounts. \nWe expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. \nMany of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. \n# \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $\\$303$ million of gross accounts receivable classified as Other noncurrent assets. These noncurrent receivables mostly consist of accounts receivable in Chile and in the U.S. that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond December 31, 2023, or one year from the latest balance sheet date. Noncurrent receivables in Chile pertain primarily to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government. The receivables in the U.S. are associated with future premium payments on a heat rate call option which are expected to be received in 2024. See Note 7—Financing Receivables included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 1.—Business—South America SBU—Argentina—Regulatory Framework and Market Structure, and Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Chile of this Form 10-K for further information. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $\\$1$ billion of loans receivable primarily related to a facility constructed under a BOT contract in Vietnam. This loan receivable represents contract consideration related to the construction of the facility, which was substantially completed in 2015, and will be collected over the 25-year term of the plant's PPA. As of December 31, 2021, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance, net of CECL reserve, was classified in held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, $\\$91$ million was classified as Current held-for-sale assets, and $\\$1$ billion was classified as Noncurrent held-for-sale assets. As of December 31, 2022, Mong Duong no longer met the held-for-sale criteria. As such, the loan receivable balance of $\\$1$ billion, net of CECL reserve of $\\$28$ million, was classified as a Loan receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 20—Revenue included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. \n# \nThe primary sources of cash for the Company in the year ended December 31, 2022 were debt financings and supplier financing arrangements, cash flows from operating activities, sales of short-term investments, and sales to noncontrolling interests.

In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated.

See Item 1A.—Risk Factors—The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries, of this Form 10-K. \nVarious debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our revolving credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items, limitations on liens; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions and the disposition of assets; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements.

The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support, and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2022, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. \n# \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. \nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. \nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIncome Taxes — We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts. \nBecause we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate."

        "text": "In addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI. \nIn addition, the Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits. Any effect on the realization of deferred tax assets will be recognized in the period they arise. \nImpairments — Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets, including events that lead to possible impairment, are described in detail in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets, starting with determining if an impairment indicator exists. The Company exercises judgment in determining if these indicators or events represent an impairment indicator requiring the computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. The fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. Please see Fair Value below for further detail. \nAs part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. \nFurther discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nDepreciation — Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. The Company considers many factors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-taker agreements, and laws and regulations, among others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and require management to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon. \nUseful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed periodically for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change to useful lives is considered a change in accounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis. \nFair Value — For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policie included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments — A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 5—Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nFair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities — Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and"

        "text": "goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the relevant accounting guidance requires the Company to recognize the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by VIEs at fair value. \nThe Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The Company generally utilizes the income approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") model to estimate fair value by discounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. \nManagement applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices, rising interest rates, and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. \nA considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. See Note 6—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification. \nThe fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Credit risk for AES is evaluated at the level of the entity that is party to the contract. Nonperformance risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize market inputs that may or may not be observable. \nAs a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, and future foreign exchange rates. Refer to Note 5—Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. \nThe fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, and Platt's). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, published pricing may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value."

        "text": "Regulatory Assets — Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. \nConsolidation — The Company enters into transactions impacting the Company's equity interests in its affiliates. In connection with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the transaction impacts the Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights. \nIf the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must consolidate the entity is whether the Company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by AES. \nAlternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES shareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates. \nPension and Other Postretirement Plans — The Company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. The valuation of the Company's benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs requires various estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. These assumptions are reviewed by the Company on an annual basis. Refer to Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. \nRevenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity, and other services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale of energy, capacity, and other services represent a single performance obligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract. Generally, the promise to transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to be accounted for as a series of distinct goods or services. Progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured using output methods, such as MWhs delivered or MWs made available, and when we are entitled to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to the value of our performance completed to date, we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. For further information regarding the nature of our revenue streams and our critical accounting policies affecting revenue recognition, see Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nLeases — The Company recognizes operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for most leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months. Lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. Our subsidiaries’ incremental borrowing rates are used in determining the present value of lease payments when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as prepayments, lease incentives, or initial direct costs.

In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to our issuance of debt and related financial instruments. \nThe disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For further information regarding market risk, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors, Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position; Wholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for future growth; We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology of this 2022 Form 10-K. \n# \nAlthough we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels, and environmental credits, some of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales, have contracted electricity obligations greater than supply or operate under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. These businesses subject our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels, and environmental credits in competitive markets. We employ risk management strategies to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these strategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options. \nThe portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectly matched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales that lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at which the electricity can be sold. \nAES businesses will see changes in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2023, we project pre-tax earnings exposure on a $10\\%$ (uncorrelated) move in commodity prices to be approximately a $\\$5$ million gain for power, a $\\$10$ million loss for oil, and a $\\$5$ million loss for coal and natural gas. Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas prices can be accompanied by a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs with lower power, lower oil, higher natural gas, and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses."

        "text": "Commodity prices affect our businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot power prices, contract indexation provisions, and generation costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil, and coal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others. Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flexibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limit downside exposure by reducing dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting power prices. \nIn the US and Utilities SBU, the generation businesses are largely contracted but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to the business drivers. At Southland, our existing once-through cooling generation units (“Legacy Assets”) are permitted to operate through the end of 2023. These assets have contracts in capacity and have seen incremental value in energy revenues. \nIn the South America SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales in both. The significant portion of our PPAs include mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations in the price of coal, with the specific indices and timing varying by contract, in order to mitigate changes in the price of fuel. For the portion of our contracts not indexed to the price of coal, we have implemented a hedging strategy based on international coal financial instruments for up to 3 years. In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. Additionally, in Brazil, the hydroelectric generating facility is covered by contract sales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may have to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation. \nIn the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under financial and load-following PPA type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less than the contract volumes, the business will be sensitive to changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices in some time periods. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas plants contracted under a portfolio of contract sales, and both contract and spot prices may move with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not always match our generation availability and our assets may be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations. \nIn the Eurasia SBU, our assets operating in Vietnam and Bulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no or minor merchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism. \n# \nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay taxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Our exposure to certain of these currencies may be material. These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations. \nAES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on"

As of December 31, 2022, assuming a $10\\%$ USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign subsidiaries exposed to movement in the exchange rate of the Brazilian real are projected to be impacted by less than a $\\$10$ million gain, a less than $\\$5$ million gain for the Colombian peso and a less than $\\$5$ million loss for the Euro. These numbers have been produced by applying a onetime $10\\%$ USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2023 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the currencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains/losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivities presented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility. \n# \nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, as well as interest rate swap, cap, floor, and option agreements. Decisions on the fixed-floating debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on whether a plant's capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap, and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our businesses. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the portfolio's pre-tax earnings exposure for 2023 to a one-time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for our Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Euro, and USD denominated debt would be less than $\\$55$ million on interest expense for the debt denominated in these currencies. These amounts do not take into account the historical correlation between these interest rates."

        "text": "# \n# \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s goodwill balance was $\\$362$ million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units and utilized the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of these reporting units. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the estimated fair value was less than the carrying amount for both of these reporting units and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $\\$77$ million during the fourth quarter of 2022. \nAuditing the Company’s annual goodwill impairment tests for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units required judgment to evaluate the effects of macroeconomic and industry conditions and involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of these reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates of the reporting units involve the use of significant unobservable inputs and are sensitive to changes in significant assumptions, such as the interest rates and country risk premiums, which are inputs used to determine the discount rates. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review and testing process for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the valuation models, the significant assumptions described above, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations. \nTo test the estimated fair value for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to develop the estimated fair values, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and the discount rates used in the fair value estimate. \n# \n# \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $\\$23,039$ million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company’s useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of $\\$601$ million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022."

        "text": "Auditing the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives was complex and highly judgmental because of the many geographic, regulatory, and economic environments in which the Company operates. Also, due to the wide variety of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset group is not recoverable or that may result in a change in useful life, auditing the Company’s identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives involved a high degree of subjectivity, particularly given the Company’s decarbonization initiatives and shift towards clean energy platforms. In addition, auditing the Company’s valuation of long-lived assets used in the Maritza and TEG TEP impairment analyses involved significant judgment due to the significant unobservable inputs used in the estimation of the asset groups’ fair value. In particular, the significant assumptions for the income approach used to determine the fair value of the asset groups included the Company’s projections of revenue growth and discount rates, which are forward-looking assumptions and could be affected by future industry, market, and economic conditions. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the identification of impairment indicators, re-evaluation of estimated useful lives, and the valuation of the Maritza and TEG TEP long-lived asset impairments. For example, we tested management’s monitoring controls over the evaluation of events or changes in circumstances that would require an asset to be tested for recoverability. We also tested management’s review controls of the valuation models used in the impairment analyses, the significant assumptions used to develop the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations. \nTo test the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives, our audit procedures included, among others, making inquiries of management, including personnel in operations, to understand changes in the businesses and management’s strategic plans, and evaluate whether management has considered any identified changes in their analysis. We evaluated the results of earnings and the projected cash flows for significant coal generation assets and assessed whether there has been a deterioration in earnings or projected losses that would represent an impairment indicator. We also evaluated conditions and trends in the industry for the underlying economies, including any sale or disposition activities, and evaluated any adverse changes in the regulatory environment or the geographic areas to test the completeness and accuracy of the company's evaluation of potential impairment indicators. We evaluated the Company’s useful life estimates, in particular for its significant coal generation assets, considering the existing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the market for the use of these assets subsequent to the expiration of existing PPAs, based on the regulatory and market conditions. \nTo test the impairment analyses for the Maritza and TEG TEP asset groups, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the appropriateness of valuation methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends as well as historical results. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the asset groups that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall valuation methodology and the discount rates used in the fair value estimates."

        "text": "# \n# \nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). \nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. \nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS — Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero. \nEquity securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified as temporary equity and are included in Redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. The subsequent allocation of income and dividends is classified in temporary equity. Subsequent measurement and classification vary depending on whether the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. For those securities that are currently redeemable or where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable, AES recognizes any changes from the carrying value to redemption value at each reporting period against retained earnings or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings; such adjustments are classified in temporary equity. When the equity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, no adjustment to the carrying value is recognized. Instruments that are mandatorily redeemable are classified as a liability. \nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS — Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in Net equity in losses of affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe Company utilizes the cumulative earnings approach to determine whether distributions received from equity method investees are returns on investment or returns of investment. The Company discontinues the application of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the equity method accounting to the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded. \nUpon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the basis difference between each fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee. The AES share of the amortization of the basis difference is recognized in Net equity in losses of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the life of the asset or liability. \nThe Company periodically assesses if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments. When an impairment is observed, any excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment"

        "text": "expense when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in Other non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nBUSINESS INTERESTS — Acquisitions and disposals of business interests are generally transactions pertaining to operational legal entities, which may be accounted for as a consolidated business, an asset, or an equity method investment. Losses on expected sales of business interests are limited to the impairment of long-lived assets as of the date of execution of the sales agreement, which are recognized in Asset impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any gains/(losses) upon the completion of disposals, which include reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments, are recognized in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon completion of the sale. \nALLOCATION OF EARNINGS — Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements where the allocation of cash distributions and the sharing of tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. These arrangements exist for certain U.S. renewable generation partnerships to designate different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or percentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method when it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to each partner based on the liquidation provisions of the respective operating partnership agreement if the partnership was to be liquidated at book value at the balance sheet date. Each partner’s share of income in the period is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are legally able to claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of that period, adjusted for any capital transactions. \nThe HLBV method is used both to allocate the equity earnings attributable to AES when the Company accounts for the renewable business as an equity method investment and to calculate the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest when the business is consolidated by AES. In the early months of operations of a renewable generation facility where HLBV results in a significant decrease in the hypothetical liquidation proceeds attributable to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") or other adjustments as required by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Company records the impact (sometimes referred to as the ‘Day one gain’) to income in the same period. \nUSE OF ESTIMATES — U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability balances reported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financial instruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as business combinations or as asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; contingent consideration arising from business combinations or asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; the measurement of equity method investments or noncontrolling interest using the HLBV method for certain renewable generation partnerships; pension liabilities; the incremental borrowing rates used in the determination of lease liabilities; the determination of lease and non-lease components in certain generation contracts; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements. \nHELD-FOR-SALE DISPOSAL GROUPS — A disposal group classified as held-for-sale is reflected on the balance sheet at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. A loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell. This loss is limited to the carrying value of long-lived assets until the completion of the sale, at which point, any additional loss is recognized. If the fair value of the disposal group subsequently exceeds the carrying amount while the disposal group is still held-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lesser of the previously recognized expense or the subsequent excess. \nAssets and liabilities related to a disposal group classified as held-for-sale are segregated in the current balance sheet in the period in which the disposal group is classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale disposal groups are classified as current when they are expected to be disposed of within twelve months. Transactions between the held-for-sale disposal group and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. See Note 24—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information."

        "text": "DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS — Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a business or a group of businesses represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. The Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued operations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations are included within the relevant categories within operating, investing and financing activities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nTransactions between the businesses determined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued operations include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell, including gains or losses associated with noncontrolling interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously reported as discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in the current period even if the disposed-of component to which the adjustments are related would not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under current guidance. \nFAIR VALUE — Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting guidance to financial assets and liabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items Short-term investments and Other noncurrent assets; derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other noncurrent assets; and, derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other noncurrent liabilities. The Company applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or of an asset acquisition by a variable interest entity, or in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group, equity method investments, or goodwill. \nWhen determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be reflected at their fair values, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value. \nIn determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are categorized within a fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement: \n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   \n• Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or   \n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities. \nAny transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. \nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS — The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash balances not restricted as to withdrawal or usage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. \nRESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES — Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or usage, primarily via contract, are considered restricted cash."

        "text": "The following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the total of such amounts as shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in millions): \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n & December31,2022 & December31,2021 \\\\\nCashandcashequivalents $ & 1,374 $ & 943 \\\\\nRestrictedcash & 536 & 304 \\\\\nDebtservicereservesandotherdeposits & 177 & 237 \\\\\nCash,CashEquivalentsandRestrictedCash & $ 2,087 & 1,484 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nINVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES — The Company's marketable investments are primarily unsecured debentures, certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. \nShort-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities with original maturities in excess of three months with remaining maturities of less than one year. Marketable debt securities where the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. Remaining marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value. \nUnrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are not credit-related are reflected in AOCL, a separate component of equity, and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance with a corresponding impact recognized as a credit loss in Other Expense. Unrealized gains or losses on equity investments are reported in Other income. Interest and dividends on investments are reported in Interest income and Other income, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of investments are determined using the specific identification method. \nACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for doubtful accounts in accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible. \nINVENTORY — Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items are considered obsolete. \nLONG-LIVED ASSETS — Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under finance leases and intangible assets subject to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets). \nProperty, plant and equipment — Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. \nConstruction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in progress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time construction completion is determined to no longer be probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related to successful completion, including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract compliance. Construction-in-progress balances are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is ready for its intended use. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recovered for construction delays, and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected in cash flows from investing activities. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred."

        "text": "Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. Capital spare parts, including rotable spare parts, are included in electric generation and distribution assets. If the spare part is considered a component, it is depreciated over its useful life after the part is placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset, the part is depreciated over the composite useful life even when being held as a spare part. \nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries operate under concession contracts. Certain estimates are utilized to determine depreciation expense for the subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered under these concession contracts are based on estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amounts recovered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not within the scope of ASC 853—Service Concession Arrangements. \nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization — Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives which range from 1 – 50 years and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line item Other intangible assets. The Company accounts for purchased emission allowances as intangible assets and records an expense when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero. \nImpairment of Long-lived Assets — When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value (subject to the carrying amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). An impairment expense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery through approved rates is probable. \nDEBT ISSUANCE COSTS — Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and presented as a direct reduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing period using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit or revolving credit facility are deferred and presented as an asset and amortized over the related financing period. Make-whole payments in connection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financing activities. \nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annual impairment testing date is October $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ . \nGoodwill — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the business acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill resulting from an acquisition is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each AES business with a goodwill balance constitutes a reporting unit as they are not similar to other businesses in a segment nor are they reported to segment management together with other businesses. \nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the quantitative test option to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill, is recorded. \nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include land-use rights and water rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or by performing the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset being tested for impairment exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense."

        "text": "ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES — Accounts payable consists of amounts due to trade creditors related to the Company's core business operations. These payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased for resale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw materials. Other accrued liabilities includes $\\$662$ million related to supplier financing arrangements, of which $\\$296$ million has a Parent Company guarantee; interest incurred for these arrangements is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense or, if eligible for capitalization, to Property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining balance of other accrued liabilities includes items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legal contingencies, and employee-related costs, including payroll, and benefits. \nREGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES — The Company recognizes assets and liabilities that result from regulated ratemaking processes. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs which have been deferred due to the probable future recovery via customer rates. Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest Income. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to refund customers. Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable of future payment by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off and recognized in income from continuing operations. \nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS — The Company recognizes in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value. AES follows the measurement date provisions of the accounting guidance, which require a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obligations for all defined benefit plans. \nINCOME TAXES — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions are evaluated under a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial statement reporting. \nUncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company's policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI. \nThe Company applies the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits. \nThe Company's accounting policy for releasing the income tax effects from AOCL occurs on a portfolio basis. \nThe Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits. Any effect on the realization of deferred tax assets will be recognized in the period they arise. \nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS — The Company records the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Company eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, may incur a gain or loss. \nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates and is generally the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end of"

        "text": "the fiscal period. Adjustments arising from the translation of the balance sheet of such subsidiaries are included in AOCL. The revenue and expense accounts of such subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and which the Company does not intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recognized in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified from AOCL to net income only when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments are included in carrying amounts in impairment assessments where the Company has committed to a plan that will cause the accumulated adjustments to be reclassified to earnings. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue is earned from the sale of electricity from our utilities,the production and sale of electricity and capacity from our generation facilities, and development and construction of generation facilities. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities. \nUtilities — Our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. The majority of our utility contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promises to transfer energy, capacity, and other distribution and/or transmission services are not distinct. Additionally, as the performance obligation is satisfied over time as energy is delivered, and the same method is used to measure progress, the performance obligation meets the criteria to be considered a series. Utility revenue is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nIn exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (“tariffs”) that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity. Since tariffs are determined by the regulator, the price that our utilities have the right to bill corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the utility's performance completed in each period. The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an output method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the approved tariff. \nThe Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchase power to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose to receive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the provider and recognize revenue on a net basis. \nGeneration — Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can have one or more performance obligations as the promise to transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the contract. \nFor contracts determined to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price using a market or expected cost plus margin approach. Additionally, the Company allocates variable consideration to one or more, but not all, distinct goods or services that form part of a single performance obligation when (1) the variable consideration relates specifically to the efforts to transfer the distinct good or service and (2) the variable consideration depicts the amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer. \nIf the contract is determined to contain a performance obligation related to capacity, the performance obligation is generally satisfied over time, and if we use the same method to measure progress, the performance obligations meet the criteria to be considered a series. In measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation, the Company applies the \"right to invoice\" practical expedient when available and recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to consideration from a customer that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Revenue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations."

        "text": "Energy performance obligations are recognized using an output method, as energy delivered best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Performance obligations to deliver energy are generally satisfied when the MW is generated. In certain contracts, if plant availability exceeds a contractual target, the Company may receive a performance bonus payment, or if the plant availability falls below a guaranteed minimum target, we may incur a non-availability penalty. Such bonuses or penalties represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal. \nCertain generation contracts contain operating and sales-type leases where capacity payments are generally considered lease elements. In such cases, the allocation between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease following the guidance in ASC 842. \nIn assessing whether variable quantities are considered variable consideration or an option to acquire additional goods and services, the Company evaluates the nature of the promise and the legally enforceable rights in the contract. In some contracts, such as requirement contracts, the legally enforceable rights merely give the customer a right to purchase additional goods and services which are distinct. In these contracts, the customer's action results in a new obligation, and the variable quantities are considered an option. \nWhen energy or capacity is sold or purchased in the spot market or to ISOs, the Company assesses the facts and circumstances to determine gross versus net presentation of spot revenues and purchases. Generally, the nature of the performance obligation is to sell surplus energy or capacity above contractual commitments, or to purchase energy or capacity to satisfy deficits. Generally, on an hourly basis, a generator is either a net seller or a net buyer in terms of the amount of energy or capacity transacted with the ISO. In these situations, the Company recognizes revenue for the hours where the generator is a net seller and cost of sales for the hours where the generator is a net buyer. \nThe transaction price allocated to a construction performance obligation is recognized as revenue over time as construction activity occurs, with revenue being fully recognized upon completion of construction. These contracts may include a difference in timing between revenue recognition and the collection of cash receipts, which may be collected over the term of the entire arrangement. The timing difference could result in a significant financing component for the construction performance obligation if determined to be a material component of the transaction price. The Company accounts for a significant financing component under the effective interest rate method, recognizing a long-term receivable for the expected future payments related to the construction performance obligation in the Loan Receivable line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As payments are collected from the customer over the term of the contract, consideration related to the construction performance obligation is bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related interest income, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nContract Balances — The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivable and contract liabilities. Accounts receivable represent unconditional rights to consideration and consist of both billed amounts and unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. We bill both generation and utilities customers on a contractually agreed-upon schedule, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly). The calculation of revenue earned but not yet billed is based on the number of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered during those days and the estimated average price per customer class for that month. \nOur contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. The current portion of our contract liabilities is reported in Accrued and other liabilities and the noncurrent portion is reported in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nRemaining Performance Obligations — The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. The Company has elected to apply the optional disclosure exemptions under ASC 606. Therefore, the amount disclosed in Note 20—Revenue excludes contracts with an original length of one year or less, contracts for which we recognize revenue based on the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed, and variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation when the consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and depicts the amount to which we expect to be entitled. As such, consideration for energy is excluded from the amount disclosed as the variable consideration relates to the amount of energy delivered and reflects the value the Company expects to receive for the energy"

        "text": "transferred. Estimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future periods also exclude unexercised customer options to purchase additiona goods or services that do not represent material rights to the customer. \nLEASES — The Company has operating and finance leases for energy production facilities, land, office space, transmission lines, vehicles and other operating equipment in which the Company is the lessee. Operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or subleases. \nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized on commencement of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Generally, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable; as such, we use the subsidiaries’ incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company determines discount rates based on its existing credit rates of its unsecured borrowings, which are then adjusted for the appropriate lease term and currency. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives that are paid or payable to the lessee at commencement. The lease term includes the option to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. \nThe Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer in which the Company is the lessor. Capacity payments are generally considered lease elements as they cover the majority of available output from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease. Fixed lease payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recognized when earned. \nThe Company has sales-type leases for BESS in which the Company is the lessor. These arrangements allow customers the ability to determine when to charge and discharge the BESS, representing the transfer of control and constitutes the arrangement as a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on the present value of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset. \nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The Company grants share-based compensation in the form of restricted stock units, performance stock units, performance cash units, and stock options. The expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a BlackScholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees. \nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES — General and administrative expenses include corporate and other expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, which are not directly allocable to our business segments. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general and administrative expenses. \nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES — Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognizes all contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See Note 5—Fair Value and Fair value in this section for additional discussion regarding the determination of fair value. \nPPAs and fuel supply agreements are evaluated to assess if they contain either a derivative or an embedded derivative requiring separate valuation and accounting. Generally, these agreements do not meet the definition of a derivative, often due to the inability to be net settled. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the markets for commodities to be delivered under these agreements to determine if facts and circumstances have changed such that the agreements could be net settled and meet the definition of a derivative. \nThe Company typically designates its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges if they meet the criteria specified in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the variability of expected future cash interest payments. Foreign currency contracts are used to reduce risks arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The objective of"

        "text": "these practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. The Company also enters into commodity contracts to economically hedge price variability inherent in electricity sales arrangements. The objectives of the commodity contracts are to minimize the impact of variability in spot electricity prices and stabilize estimated revenue streams. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. \nFor our hedges, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings. If a derivative is no longer highly effective, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates the probability of the occurrence and timing of such transactions. \nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives are recognized in earnings, they are generally classified as interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or nonregulated cost of sales for commodity and other derivatives. Cash flows arising from derivatives are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying risk being economically hedged and the lack of significant financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as an investing activity. The Company has elected not to offset net derivative positions in the financial statements. \nCREDIT LOSSES — In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records an allowance for current expected credit losses (“CECL”) for accounts and notes receivable, financing receivables, contract assets, net investments in leases recognized as a lessor, held-to-maturity debt securities, financial guarantees related to the non-payment of a financial obligation, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance. The CECL allowance is based on the asset's amortized cost and reflects management's expected risk of credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset. CECL allowances are estimated using relevant information about the collectibility of cash flows and consider information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. See New Accounting Pronouncements below for further information regarding the impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption of ASC 326. \nThe following table represents the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated (in millions): \n\n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\nTwelveMonthsEndedDecember31,2022 & Accounts Receivable (1) & MongDuongLoan Receivable & Argentina Receivables(2) & Lease Receivable(3) &  & Other & Total \\\\\nCECLreservebalanceatbeginningofperiod & 9 & 30 &  & $ & $ &  & $ 63 \\\\\nCurrentperiodprovision & 10 &  &  &  & 20 &  & 53 \\\\\nWrite-offschargedagainstallowance & (19) &  &  &  &  &  & (19) \\\\\nRecoveriescollected & 3 & (2) & (1) \\\\\nForeign exchange &  &  & (14) &  &  &  & (14) \\\\\nCECLreservebalanceatendofperiod & 3 & 28 &  & $ & 20 & 2 & $ 83 \\\\\nTwelveMonthsEndedDecember31,2021 & Accounts Receivable & MongDuongLoan & Argentina \\\\\nCECLreservebalanceatbeginningofperiod &  & Receivable $ & Receivables $ & 20 & Other & 1 $ & Total 62 \\\\\nCurrentperiodprovision &  &  & 32 & 7 \\\\\n &  &  &  &  &  &  & 16 \\\\\nWrite-offs charged against allowance Recoveriescollected & (11) &  & (2) &  &  &  & (11) \\\\\n &  &  &  & (4) \\\\\nForeignexchange CECLreservebalanceatendofperiod & $ & $ & 30 $ & 23 &  & 1 $ & (4) 63 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(1) Excludes operating lease receivable allowances and contractual dispute allowances of $\\$1$ million and $\\$2$ million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The new standard updates the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments, entities are required to use a new forward-looking \"expected loss\" model that generally results in the earlier recognition of an allowance for credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses as it was done under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors are now recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the income statement. \nThe Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for ASC 326.

        "text": "Mong Duong — The Mong Duong II power plant in Vietnam is the primary driver of changes in credit reserves under the new standard. This plant is operated under a build, operate, and transfer (“BOT”) contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25-year PPA. A loan receivable was recognized in 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606 in order to account for the future expected payments for the construction performance obligation portion of the BOT contract. As the payments for the construction performance obligation occur over a 25-year term, a significant financing element was determined to exist which is accounted for under the effective interest rate method. Historically, the Company has not incurred any losses on this arrangement, of which no directly comparable assets exist in the market. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 326 arising from this $\\$1.4$ billion loan receivable as of January 1, 2020, the Company considered average historical default and recovery rates on similarly rated sovereign bonds, which formed an initial basis for developing a probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator for this arrangement. A resulting estimated loss rate of $2.4\\%$ was applied to the weighted-average remaining life of the loan receivable, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including the Company’s status as a large foreign direct investor in Vietnam, Mong Duong’s status as critical energy infrastructure in Vietnam, and cash flows from the operations of the plant, which are under the Company’s control until the end of the BOT contract. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized an opening CECL reserve of $\\$34$ million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit and Noncontrolling interests as of January 1, 2020. \nArgentina — Exposure to CAMMESA, the administrator of the wholesale energy market in Argentina, is the driver of credit reserves in Argentina. As discussed in Note 7—Financing Receivables, the Company has credit exposures through the FONINVEMEM Agreements, other agreements related to resolutions passed by the Argentine government in which AES Argentina will receive compensation for investments in new generation plants and technologies, as well as regular accounts receivable balances. The timing of collections depends on corresponding agreements and collectability of these receivables are assessed on an ongoing basis. \nCollection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of power plants which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amount of collections, and economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. Historically, the Company has not incurred any credit-related losses on these receivables. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 326, the Company considered historical default probabilities utilizing similarly rated sovereign bonds and historic recovery rates for Argentine government bond defaults. This information formed an initial basis for developing a probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator across the underlying financing receivables. A resulting estimated weighted average loss rate of $41.2\\%$ was applied to the remaining balance of these receivables, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including AES Argentina’s role in providing critical energy infrastructure to Argentina, our history of collections on these receivables, and the average term that the receivables are expected to be outstanding. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized an opening CECL reserve of $\\$23$ million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2020. \nOther financial assets — Application of ASC 326 to the Company’s $\\$1.5$ billion of trade accounts receivable and $\\$326$ million of availablefor-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any material adjustments, primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover of these financial assets. Additionally, a large portion of our trade accounts receivables and amounts reserved for doubtful accounts under legacy GAAP arise from arrangements accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842, which are excluded from the scope of ASC 326. \nAs discussed in Note 7—Financing Receivables, AES Andes recorded $\\$33$ million of noncurrent receivables at December 31, 2020 pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government in October 2019. The Company expects to collect these noncurrent receivables through the execution of sale agreements with third parties. However, given the investment grade rating of Chile and the history of zero credit losses for regulated customers, management determined that no incremental CECL reserves were required to be recognized as of January 1, 2020."

The Company uses the cost approach to determine the initial value of ARO liabilities, which is estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value using market-based rates at the initial recording of the liabilities. Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal costs as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates. Subsequent downward revisions of ARO liabilities are discounted using the market-based rates that existed when the liability was initially recognized. These inputs to the fair value of the ARO liabilities are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at Southland Energy, AES Clean Energy, AES Indiana, and AES Brasil by $\\$75$ million, $\\$27$ million, $\\$27$ million, and $\\$16$ million, respectively.

The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations as a result of the New York Wind acquisition. The increase in Chile is primarily due to shortened useful lives of the Ventanas and Angamos coal plants, additional liabilities incurred due to the development of the Andes Solar 2b plant, and an upward revision of estimated cash flows at the Los Cururos plant. \n# \nThe fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves, and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. Because these amounts are estimates and based on hypothetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. \nValuation Techniques — The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return on those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company measures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value. \nInvestments — The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments are generally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. \nDerivatives — Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR, SOFR, and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as applicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market. \nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in certain instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the use of proxy yield curves of similar credit quality. \nTo determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate. The Company then makes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potential"

        "text": "future scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt spreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a liability position is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated credit rating (based on applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevant information) and spreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to unique risk exposures. \nThe fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is considered significant if it affects the fair value by at least $10\\%$ . Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs is significant. When the use of unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA. \nDebt — Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted market prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upon interest rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The fair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2022. The Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2022. \nNonrecurring measurements — For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is generally determined using valuation models based on the principles of DCF. The income approach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equity method investments, goodwill, and intangible assets. Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certain input assumptions, the Company develops its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in the valuation process. \nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar assets are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach. \nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach. \nFair Value Considerations — In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are: \nSources of market assumptions — The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions. \nMarket liquidity — The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction. \nNonperformance risk — Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a liability is transferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited"

The Tariff Stabilization Laws do not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the pricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated to supply regulated contracts. Consequently, costs incurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price are accumulated and borne by generators. Through different programs, AES Andes aims to reduce its exposure and has already sold a significant portion of the receivables accumulated as of December 31, 2021. \nAs of December 31, 2022, $\\$26$ million of current receivables and $\\$227$ million of noncurrent receivables were recorded in Accounts receivable and Other noncurrent assets, respectively, pertaining to the Stabilization Funds.

        "text": "Argentina — Collection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of power plants which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amount of collections, and economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on these receivables once the recognition criteria have been met. The Company's collection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from these estimates. \nAs a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with the Argentine government, referred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of combined cycle and gas-fired plants. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plant begins operations. \nThe FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated in Argentine pesos, but indexed to USD, which represents a foreign currency derivative. Due to differences between spot rates, used to remeasure the receivables, and discounted forward rates, used to value the foreign currency derivative, these two items will not perfectly offset over the life of the receivable. Once settled, the foreign currency derivative will offset the accumulated unrealized foreign currency losses resulting from the devaluation of the FONINVEMEM receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing receivables that were excluded from the table above had a fair value of $\\$64$ million and $\\$108$ million, respectively. \nThe receivables under the FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants commenced operations in 2010 and 2016. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers historic collection evidence in accordance with the agreements. \n# \nThe following table summarizes the relevant effective equity ownership interest and carrying values for the Company's investments accounted for under the equity method as of the periods indicated: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{December31, Affiliate} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Country} & 2022 & 2021 & 2022 & 2021 \\\\\n &  & CarryingValue(inmillions) &  & OwnershipInterest% \\\\\nsPower(1) & UnitedStates & $ 432 & $ 492 & 50% & 50% \\\\\nFluence & UnitedStates & 205 & 304 & 34 % & 34 % \\\\\nGrupoEnergiaGasPanama & Panama & 82 & 41 & 49% & 49% \\\\\nUplight & UnitedStates & 81 & 103 & 29% & 29 % \\\\\nEnergia Natural Dominicana Enadom (2) & DominicanRepublic & 64 & 53 & 43% & 43% \\\\\nMesaLaPaz & Mexico & 32 & 48 \\\\\nBarry (3) & United Kingdom &  &  & 50 % 100% & 50 % \\\\\nOtheraffiliates(4) & Various & 56 & 39 &  & 100% \\\\\nTotal &  & $ 952 $ & 1,080 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(1) In February 2021, the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms were merged to form AES Clean Energy Development.

As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $\\$35$ million in Other income.

        "text": "25—Acquisitions for further information. As the Company still does not control sPower after these transactions, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment. \nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to sell $49\\%$ of its indirect interest in a portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\"). At the time the purchase and sale agreement was signed, a loss was expected upon closing the transaction, which occurred on February 28, 2023. The expected loss on sale was identified as a triggering event and the Company evaluated whether its investment in sPower was other-thantemporarily impaired. Based on management’s estimate of fair value of $\\$432$ million, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $\\$175$ million in Other non-operating expense in December 2022. \nsPower primarily holds operating assets where the tax credits associated with underlying projects have already been allocated to tax equity partners. The application of HLBV accounting increases the carrying value of these investments, as earnings are initially disproportionately allocated to the sponsor entity. Since sPower does not have any ongoing development or other value creation activities following the transfer of these activities to AES Clean Energy Development, the impairment adjusts the carrying value to the fair market value of the operating assets. sPower is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nAlto Maipo — In May 2022, Alto Maipo emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Alto Maipo, as restructured, is considered a VIE. As the Company lacks the power to make significant decisions, it does not meet the criteria to be considered the primary beneficiary of Alto Maipo and therefore will not consolidate the entity. The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Alto Maipo as management believes this approach will better reflect the economics of its equity interest. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value is insignificant. Alto Maipo is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nFluence — In June 2021, Fluence issued new shares to the Qatar Investment Authority $\\left({}^{4}\\mathsf{Q}|\\mathsf{A}^{\\mathfrak{N}}\\right)$ for $\\$125$ million, which following the completion of the transaction, represented a $13.6\\%$ ownership interest in Fluence. As a result of the transaction, which AES has accounted for as a partial disposition, AES’ ownership interest in Fluence decreased from $50\\%$ to $43.2\\%$ , and the Company recognized a gain of $\\$60$ million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests. \nOn November 1, 2021, Fluence completed its IPO of 35,650,000 of its Class A common stock at a price of $\\$28$ per share, including the exercise of the underwriters’ option. Fluence received approximately $\\$936$ million in proceeds, after expenses, as a result of the transaction. AES’ ownership interest in Fluence decreased to $34.2\\%$ . The Company recognized a gain of $\\$325$ million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests. AES' ownership interest further decreased to $33.5\\%$ as of December 31, 2022 as a result of the settlement of share based awards at Fluence. As the Company still does not control Fluence after these transactions, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported as part of Corporate and Other. \nUplight — In July 2021, the Company closed on a transaction involving existing and new shareholders of Uplight. As part of the transaction, the Company contributed $\\$37$ million to Uplight; however, AES’s ownership interest in Uplight decreased from $32.3\\%$ to $29.6\\%$ primarily due to larger contributions from other investors. The transaction was accounted for as a partial disposition in which AES recognized a loss of $\\$25$ million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests, mainly as a result of the settlement of share based awards at Uplight as well as the expenses associated with the transaction. \nIn October 2021, the Company contributed an additional $\\$23$ million to Uplight. AES' ownership interest decreased to $29.4\\%$ as a result of equity granted to retained executives at a company acquired by Uplight. As the Company still does not control Uplight after the transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported as part of Corporate and Other. \nGas Natural Atlántico II — In September 2021, the Company acquired the remaining equity interest in Gas Natural Atlántico II, S. de. R.L., a partnership whose purpose is to construct transmission lines for Colon. After additional assets were acquired, the Company remeasured the investment at the acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of a $\\$6$ million gain, recorded in Other income. The partnership, previously recorded as an equity method investment, is now consolidated by AES and is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment. \nGrupo Energía Gas Panamá — In April 2021, Grupo Energía Gas Panamá, a joint venture between AES and InterEnergy Power & Gas Limited, completed the acquisition of the Gatun combined cycle natural gas development project. AES holds a $49\\%$ ownership interest in the affiliate. The Company contributed $\\$44$ million to the joint venture as of December 31, 2021 and has contributed a total of $\\$45$ million as of December 31, 2022.

Impairment indicators were identified primarily as a result of inability to re-contract Guacolda’s generation after expiration of its existing PPAs driven by lower energy prices in Chile and reduced forecasted cash flows resulting from decarbonization initiatives of the Chilean Government. Guacolda recognized a long-lived asset impairment at the investee level, which negatively impacted the Company's Net equity in losses of affiliates by $\\$127$ million. As a result, the Company’s basis in its investment in Guacolda was reduced to zero and the equity method of accounting was suspended. \nIn February 2021, AES Andes entered into an agreement to sell its $50\\%$ ownership interest in Guacolda for $\\$34$ million.

        "text": "AES Andes — During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the AES Andes reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined under the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $\\$644$ million, reducing the goodwill balance of AES Andes to zero. The decrease in fair value since the date of our last impairment test was primarily driven by a higher discount rate resulting from increased interest rates and country risk premiums, as well as a decrease in forecasted energy prices and other unfavorable macroeconomic assumptions in Colombia. \nAES El Salvador — During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the El Salvador reporting unit. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and utilized the income approach. The estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $\\$133$ million, reducing the goodwill balance of AES El Salvador to zero. Since the date of our last impairment test in 2021, the Company has seen market participants substantially increase return expectations for the perceived country risk for El Salvador.

For the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized liabilities of $\\$10$ million and $\\$4$ million, respectively, for projected environmental remediation costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future costs of compliance or remediation could be higher or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that the Company may be required to incur remediation costs or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses related to environmental matters, where estimable, to be up to $\\$12$ million. The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include amounts accrued as discussed above."

The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has recognized aggregate liabilities for all claims of approximately $\\$22$ million and $\\$23$ million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities. A significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to regulatory matters and commercial disputes in international jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. \nWhere no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022. The material contingencies where a loss is reasonably possible primarily include disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged breaches of contract; alleged violation of laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses, where estimable, related to these reasonably possible material contingencies to be between $\\$51$ million and $\\$88$ million.

In accordance with the regulation, Tietê will be compensated in the form of a concession extension period, initially determined to be 2.7 years, which will be amortized from the date of the agreement until the end of the new concession period. As of December 31, 2020, the compensation to be received from the concession extension was estimated to have a fair value of $\\$184$ million, based on a preliminary time-value equivalent calculation made by the CCEE, and was recorded as a reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. In March 2021, the CCEE’s final calculation of fair value was $\\$190$ million and the Company recognized an additional reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales of $\\$6$ million. In August 2021, ANEEL published Resolution 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession originally granted to AES Brasil’s hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032. On April 14, 2022, the amended term was finalized and agreed upon by ANEEL and AES. \n# \nLESSEE — Right-of-use assets are long-term by nature.

Two plans cover U.S. non-union employees; one for Parent Company and certain US and Utilities SBU business employees, and one for AES Ohio employees. The remaining two plans include union and non-union employees at AES Indiana and union employees at AES Ohio. The DC Plans are qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate plan except for those employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is considered an eligible employee under a plan. Within the DC Plans, the Company provides matching contributions in addition to other nonmatching contributions. Participants are fully vested in their own contributions. The Company's contributions vest over various time periods ranging from immediate up to five years. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, costs for defined contribution plans were approximately $\\$31$ million, $\\$26$ million and $\\$21$ million, respectively."

These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. \nThe assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, salary growth, retirement rates, inflation, expected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods. Unrecognized gains or losses are amortized using the “corridor approach,” under which the net gain or loss in excess of $10\\%$ of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is amortized. \nSensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2022. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 2022 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2022 is affected by the December 31, 2021 assumptions.

The redemption of the preferred shares was considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock was considered temporary equity. In December 2022, AES Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares for $\\$60$ million. The preferred shares were retired upon redemption as there is no intention for the shares to be reissued. AES Indiana is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nAES Clean Energy Development Tax Equity Partnerships — The majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy Development have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. In some cases, these agreements contain certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that would enable the tax equity investor to exit in the future. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity. \nIn 2022, AES Clean Energy Development, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in multiple project companies to tax equity partners, resulting in a $\\$157$ million increase to Redeemable stock of subsidiaries. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nIPALCO — In December 2021, CDPQ made equity capital contributions of $\\$34$ million to AES U.S. Investments, subsequently contributed to IPALCO by AES U.S. Investments, and $\\$48$ million to IPALCO as part of a capital call to raise proceeds for AES Indiana's TDSIC and replacement generation projects. In December 2022, CDPQ made additional capital contributions of $\\$77$ million. The Company and CDPQ made capital contributions on a proportional share basis; therefore, the capital calls did not change CDPQ or AES' ownership interests in IPALCO.

        "text": "Potengi — In March 2022, Tucano Holding I (“Tucano”), a subsidiary of AES Brasil, issued new shares in the Potengi wind development project. BRF S.A. (“BRF”) acquired shares representing $24\\%$ of the equity in the project for $\\$12$ million, reducing the Company’s indirect ownership interest in Potengi to $35.5\\%$ . As the Company maintained control after the transaction, Potengi continues to be consolidated by the Company. As part of the transaction, BRF was given an option to sell its entire ownership interest at the conclusion of the PPA term. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity, which will be adjusted for earnings or losses allocated to the noncontrolling interest under ASC 810. Any subsequent changes in the redemption value of the exit rights will be recognized against permanent equity in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable. Potengi is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nColon — In September 2021, the Company acquired the remaining $49.9\\%$ minority ownership interest in Colon, reducing the value of the Colon temporary equity to zero. See Note 17—Equity for further information. Colon is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment. \nAES Clean Energy Development — On February 1, 2021, the Company substantially completed the merger of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. As part of the transaction, AlMCo, our existing partner in the sPower equity method investment, received a $25\\%$ minority ownership interest in the newly formed entity along with certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that would enable AIMCo to exit in the future. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity. \nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms and the value of the partnership rights initially recorded in the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in an $\\$81$ million increase in the value of the temporary equity. The temporary equity will be adjusted for earnings or losses allocated to the noncontrolling interest under ASC 810. Any subsequent changes in the redemption value of the exit rights will be recognized against permanent equity in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable. See Note 25—Acquisitions for further information. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \n# \n# \nIn March 2021, the Company issued 10,430,500 Equity Units with a total notional value of $\\$1,043$ million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $\\$100$ and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a forward stock purchase contract (“2024 Purchase Contracts”) and a $10\\%$ undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of $0\\%$ Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, issued without par and with a liquidation preference of $\\$1,000$ per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”). \nUpon reconsideration of the nature of the Equity Units, the Company re-evaluated its accounting assessment and concluded that the Equity Units should be accounted for as one unit of account based on the economic linkage between the 2024 Purchase Contracts and the Series A Preferred Stock, as well as the Company's assessment of the applicable accounting guidance relating to combining freestanding instruments. The Equity Units represent mandatorily convertible preferred stock. Accordingly, the shares associated with the combined instrument are reflected in diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company also corrected the classification of certain amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Equity to reflect the 2024 Purchase Contracts and Series A Preferred Stock as one unit of account. The corrections have no impact on the Company's net earnings, total assets, cash flows, or segment information. \nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Equity Units, the Company received approximately $\\$1$ billion in proceeds, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses. The proceeds for the issuance of 1,043,050 shares are attributed to the Series A Preferred Stock for $\\$838$ million and $\\$205$ million for the present value of the quarterly payments due to holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts (\"Contract Adjustment Payments\"). The proceeds will be used for the development of the AES renewable businesses, U.S. utility businesses, LNG infrastructure, and for other developments determined by management."

        "text": "The Series A Preferred Stock will initially not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock will not accrete. The Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of the shares of the convertible preferred stock will have limited voting rights. \nThe Series A Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to support holders’ purchase obligations under the 2024 Purchase Contracts and can be remarketed. In connection with any successful remarketing, the Company may increase the dividend rate, increase the conversion rate, and modify the earliest redemption date for the convertible preferred stock. After any successful remarketing in connection with which the dividend rate on the convertible preferred stock is increased, the Company will pay cumulative dividends on the convertible preferred stock, if declared by the board of directors, quarterly in arrears from the applicable remarketing settlement date. \nHolders of Corporate Units may create Treasury Units or Cash Settled Units from their Corporate Units as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement by substituting Treasury securities or cash, respectively, for the Convertible Preferred Stock comprising a part of the Corporate Units. \nThe Company may not redeem the Series A Preferred Stock prior to March 22, 2024. At the election of the Company, on or after March 22, 2024, the Company may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to $100\\%$ of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. \nThe 2024 Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to purchase, on February 15, 2024, for a price of $\\$100$ in cash, a maximum number of 57,292,650 shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). The 2024 Purchase Contract holders may elect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to guarantee the holders’ obligations to purchase common stock under the terms of the 2024 Purchase Contracts. The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each holder must purchase will not exceed the maximum settlement rate and is determined over a market value averaging period preceding February 15, 2024. \nThe initial maximum settlement rate of 3.864 was calculated using an initial reference price of $\\$25.88$ , equal to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on March 4, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the maximum settlement rate was 3.8691, equivalent to a reference price of $\\$25.85$ . If the applicable market value of the Company’s common stock is less than or equal to the reference price, the settlement rate will be the maximum settlement rate; and if the applicable market value of common stock is greater than the reference price, the settlement rate will be a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $\\$100$ divided by the applicable market value. Upon successful remarketing of the Series A Preferred Stock (“Remarketed Series A Preferred Stock”), the Company expects to receive additional cash proceeds of $\\$1$ billion and issue shares of Remarketed Series A Preferred Stock. \nThe Company pays Contract Adjustment Payments to the holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts at a rate of $6.875\\%$ per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2021. The $\\$205$ million present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments at inception reduced the Series A Preferred Stock. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment is made, the related liability is reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to interest expense, approximately $\\$5$ million over the three-year term. As of December 31, 2022, the present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments was $\\$89$ million. \nThe holders can settle the purchase contracts early, for cash, subject to certain exceptions and conditions in the prospectus supplement. Upon early settlement of any purchase contracts, the Company will deliver the number of shares of its common stock equal to $85\\%$ of the number of shares of common stock that would have otherwise been deliverable. \n# \nAES Clean Energy Tax Equity Partnerships — The majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects."

However, under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company was entitled to all earnings or losses until March 1, 2021, and any distributions related thereto. This transaction resulted in a $\\$275$ million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $\\$266$ million, net of tax and transaction costs, and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from AOCL to NCI of $\\$9$ million. \nIn December 2022, the Company completed the sale of an additional $14.9\\%$ ownership interest for $\\$157$ million, which decreased the Company's economic interest to $50.1\\%$ . This transaction resulted in a $\\$91$ million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $\\$94$ million, net of tax and transaction costs, partially offset by the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income from AOCL to NCI of $\\$3$ million. As the Company maintained control after these transactions, Southland Energy continues to be consolidated by the Company within the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nAES Brasil — In August 2020, AES Holdings Brasil Ltda. (\"AHB\") completed the acquisition of an additional $18.5\\%$ ownership in AES Brasil for $\\$240$ million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, through multiple transactions, AHB acquired another $1.3\\%$ ownership in AES Brasil for $\\$16$ million. In aggregate, these transactions increased the Company's economic interest in AES Brasil to $44.1\\%$ and resulted in a $\\$214$ million decrease in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $\\$94$ million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $\\$120$ million. \nIn addition, AHB committed to migrate AES Tietê to the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazilian stock exchange that requires equity capital to be composed only of common shares. On December 18, 2020, the AES Tietê board approved a proposal for the corporate reorganization and exchange of shares issued by AES Tietê with newly issued shares of AES Brasil, a formerly wholly-owned entity of AES Tietê, with the intent to list AES Brasil on Novo Mercado as the $100\\%$ shareholder of AES Tietê. The reorganization and the exchange of shares was completed on March 26, 2021, and the shares issued by AES Brasil started trading on Novo Mercado on March 29, 2021. The Company maintains majority representation on AES Brasil’s board of directors. \nThrough multiple transactions in 2021, AHB acquired an additional $1.6\\%$ ownership in AES Brasil for $\\$17$ million. These transactions increased the Company’s economic interest in AES Brasil to $45.7\\%$ and resulted in a $\\$13$ million decrease in Parent Company Stockholder’s Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $\\$6$ million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $\\$7$ million. \nIn October 2021, AES Brasil concluded a follow-on offering for the issuance of 93 million newly issued shares, which further increased the Company's indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil to $46.7\\%$ and resulted in a $\\$7$ million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in capital. \nIn September 2022, AES Brasil commenced a private placement offering for its existing shareholders to subscribe for up to 116 million newly issued shares, of which 107 million were subscribed. AES Holdings Brasil Ltda. and noncontrolling interest holders subscribed for 54 million and 53 million shares, respectively, thereby increasing AES’ indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil to $47.4\\%\\%$ and resulting in additional capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $\\$98$ million, an increase in additional paid-in capital of $\\$10$ million, and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $\\$3$ million. AES Brasil is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nChile Renovables — In July 2021, AES Andes completed the sale of a $49\\%$ ownership interest in Chile Renovables SpA (“Chile Renovables”), a subsidiary which owns the Los Cururos wind facility, to Global Infrastructure Management, LLC $(^{\\mathrm{{*}}}G|{\\mathsf{P}}^{\\mathrm{{*}}})$ for $\\$53$ million.

Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities. The Company has concluded Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results. \nRevenue and Adjusted PTC are presented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other segments except for interest, charges for certain management fees, and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intrasegment activity has been eliminated within the segment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results. \nThe following tables present financial information by segment for the periods indicated (in millions): \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{YearEndedDecember31,} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Total Revenue} \\\\\n & 2022 & 2021 $ & 2020 \\\\\nUS and Utilities SBU & $ 5,013 & $ 4,335 & 3,918 \\\\\nSouthAmericaSBU & 3,539 & 3,541 & 3,159 \\\\\nMCAC SBU & 2,868 & 2,157 & 1,766 \\\\\nEurasiaSBU & 1,217 & 1,123 & 828 \\\\\nCorporate and Other & 119 & 116 & 231 \\\\\nEliminations & (139) & (131) & (242) \\\\\nTotal Revenue & $ 12,617 $ & 11,141 $ & 9,660 \\\\\nReconciliationfromIncome(Loss)fromContinuingOperationsbeforeTaxes and EquityinEarningsofAffiliates: & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Total Adjusted PTC} \\\\\nYearEndedDecember31, & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nLossfromcontinuingoperationsbeforetaxesandequityinearningsofaffiliates & $ (169) $ & (1,064) $ & 488 \\\\\nAdd:Net equity inlosses of affliates & (71) & (24) & (123) \\\\\nLess: Income from continuing operations before taxes, attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries Pre-tax contribution & (96) & 644 & (192) \\\\\nUnrealized derivative and equitysecuritieslosses(gains) & (336) & (444) & 173 \\\\\nUnrealizedforeigncurrencylosses(gains) & 128 & (1) & 3 \\\\\nDisposition/acquisitionlosses & 42 & 14 & (10) \\\\\nImpairment losses & 40 & 861 & 112 \\\\\n & 1,658 & 1,153 & 928 \\\\\nLoss on extinguishment of debt & 35 & 91 & 223 \\\\\nNetgainsfromearlycontractterminationsatAngamos &  & (256) & (182) \\\\\nTotal Adjusted PTC & S 1,567 $ & 1,418 $ & 1,247 \\\\\n &  & Total Adjusted PTC \\\\\nYearEndedDecember31, & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nUS and Utilities SBU & $ 570 & $ 660 $ & 505 \\\\\nSouthAmericaSBU & 573 & 423 & 534 \\\\\nMCAC SBU & 559 & 314 & 287 \\\\\nEurasia SBU & 192 & 196 & 177 \\\\\nCorporate and Other & (326) & (182) & (256) \\\\\nEliminations & (1) & 7 \\\\\nTotal Adjusted PTC & $ 1,567 & 1,418 & $ 1,247 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

In all circumstances, stock options granted by AES do not entitle he holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets of AES. \nPerformance Stock Units — In 2020, 2021, and 2022, the Company issued PSUs to officers under its long-term compensation plan. PSUs are stock units which include performance conditions. For 2020, 2021, and 2022, performance conditions are based on the Company’s Parent Free Cash Flow target. The performance conditions determine the vesting and final share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of $0\\%$ to $20\\%$ , depending on the achievement.

As a result of the termination payment, Angamos recognized a contract liability of $\\$655$ million, of which $\\$55$ million was derecognized each month through the end of the remaining performance obligation in August 2021. \nA significant financing arrangement exists for our Mong Duong plant in Vietnam. The plant was constructed under a BOT contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25 year PPA. The performance obligation to construct the facility was substantially completed in 2015. Contract consideration related to the construction, but not yet collected through the 25 year PPA, was reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2021, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance of $\\$1.2$ billion, net of CECL reserve of $\\$30$ million, was classified as held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, $\\$91$ million was classified as Current held-for-sale assets, and $\\$1.1$ billion was classified as Noncurrent held-for-sale assets. As of December 31, 2022, Mong Duong no longer met the held-for-sale criteria, as such, the loan receivable balance of $\\$1.1$ billion, net of CECL reserve of $\\$28$ million, was classified as a Loan receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 24—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. \nRemaining Performance Obligations — The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $\\$9$ million, primarily consisting of fixed consideration for the sale of renewable energy credits (\"RECs\") in long-term contracts in the U.S. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately one-fifth of the remaining performance obligations in 2023 and 2024, with the remainder recognized thereafter. \n# \nOther income generally includes gains on insurance recoveries in excess of property damage, gains on asset sales and liability extinguishments, favorable judgments on contingencies, allowance for funds used during construction, and other income from miscellaneous transactions.

Due to the delay in closing the transaction, the carrying amount of the asset group in subsequent periods exceeded the agreed-upon sales price and total pre-tax impairment expense of $\\$76$ million was recorded during 2022. See Note 24—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. Jordan is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment. \nMaritza — In May 2022, the Council for the European Union approved Bulgaria’s National Recovery and Resilience plan which commits the country to cease generating electricity from coal beyond 2038. As this plan is expected to prohibit the Company from operating the Maritza coalfired plant through its estimated useful life, it was determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred. The Company reassessed the useful life of the facility and performed an impairment analysis as of April 30, 2022, in which it was determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Maritza asset group was determined to have a fair value of $\\$452$ million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\\$468$ million. Maritza is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment. \nBuffalo Gap — During the fourth quarter of 2021, due to an expired PPA and volatile spot prices in the ERCOT market, management concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets of Buffalo Gap I, II, and III wind generation facilities may not be recoverable. As such, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the fair value of each asset group, using the income approach, was zero for Buffalo Gap I, II and III. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\\$29$ million, $\\$73$ million, and $\\$91$ million at Buffalo Gap I, II, and III, respectively. Buffalo Gap is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nVentanas and Angamos — In August 2020, AES Andes reached an agreement with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence to early terminate two PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chile, further accelerating AES Andes’ decarbonization strategy. AES Andes also announced its intention to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired plants. Management will no longer be pursuing a contracting strategy for these assets and the plants will primarily be utilized as peaker plants and for grid stability. Due to these developments, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amounts of these asset groups were not recoverable. The Angamos asset group was determined to have a fair value of $\\$306$ million, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\\$564$ million and $\\$213$ million at Angamos and Ventanas 1 & 2, respectively. \nIn July 2021, AES Andes entered into an agreement committing to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 3, Ventanas 4, Angamos 1, and Angamos 2 coal-fired plants in Chile. Due to these strategic developments, the Company performed impairment analyses as of June 30, 2021, and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups were not recoverable. The Ventanas 3 & 4 and Angamos asset groups were determined to have fair values of $\\$12$ million and $\\$86$ million, respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pretax asset impairment expense of $\\$649$ million and $\\$155$ million, respectively. Ventanas and Angamos are reported in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nMountain View I & II — In April 2021, the Company approved plans to execute a repowering project for the Mountain View I & II wind facility and signed two new PPAs for the energy and capacity related to the repowered asset. As the repowering will result in decommissioning the majority of the existing wind turbines in advance of their depreciable lives, the execution of the new PPAs was identified as an impairment indicator. The asset group was determined to have a fair value of $\\$11$ million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\\$67$ million. Mountain View I & II is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nPuerto Rico — New factors arose in the first quarter of 2021 associated with the economic costs and operational and reputational risks of disposal of coal combustion residuals off island. In addition, new legislative initiatives surrounding the prohibition of coal generation assets in Puerto Rico were introduced. Collectively, these factors along with management’s decision on how to best achieve our stated decarbonization goals resulted in an indicator of impairment at our asset group in Puerto Rico. As such, management performed a recoverability test in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that Puerto Rico’s undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying"

Upon disconnection, the Company concluded that the barge was no longer part of the AES Panama asset group and performed an impairment analysis. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset was not recoverable and recognized asset impairment expense of $\\$30$ million. In September 2021, the Company recognized additional asset impairment expense of $\\$11$ million due to a change in the estimated market value of the power barge. See Note 24—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. Estrella del Mar I is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment. \nHawaii — In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature passed Senate Bill 2629 which will prohibit AES Hawaii from generating electricity from coal after December 31, 2022. Therefore, management further reassessed the economic useful life of the generation facility and a decrease in the useful life was identified as an impairment indicator. The Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $\\$38$ million during the third quarter of 2020. The Company retired the generation facility in August 2022.

However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted."

In April 2017, the ROK initiated the process to transfer these plants back to the ROK. The ROK indicated that arbitration would be necessary to determine the correct Return Share Transfer Payment (\"RST\") and, rather than paying the Affiliates, deposited the RST into an escrow account. In exchange, the Affiliates transferred $100\\%$ of the shares in the HPPs to the ROK, under protest and with a full reservation of rights. In February 2018, the Affiliates initiated the arbitration process in international court to recover at least $\\$75$ million of the RST placed in escrow, based on the September 30, 2017 RST calculation. \nIn May 2020, the arbitrator issued a final decision in favor of the Affiliates, awarding the Affiliates a net amount of damages of approximately $\\$45$ million, which has been collected. AES recorded the remaining $\\$30$ million as a loss on sale during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Prior to their transfer, the Kazakhstan HPPs were reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment. \nRedondo Beach Land — In March 2020, the Company completed the sale of land held by AES Redondo Beach, a gas-fired generating facility in California. The land’s carrying value was $\\$24$ million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $\\$41$ million, reported in Other income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. AES Redondo Beach will lease back the land from the purchaser for the remainder of the generation facility’s useful life. Redondo Beach is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nThe following table summarizes, excluding any impairment charge or gain/loss on sale, the pre-tax income attributable to AES of disposed businesses for the periods indicated (in millions): \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nYearEndedDecember31， & 2021 $ & 2020 \\\\\nAltoMaipo & 35 $ & 11 \\\\\nItabo & 5 & 41 \\\\\nEstrelladeMarI &  & 5 \\\\\nTotal & $ 40 & 57 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nCubico II — On November 30,2022, the Company, through its subsidiary AES Brasil Energia S.A (\"AES Brasil\") acquired $100\\%$ of shares of an operational wind complex comprised of (i) Ventos de São Tomé Holding S.A., (ii) Ventos de São Tito Holdings S.A., and (iii) REB Empreendimentos e Administradora de Bens S.A. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their relative fair values. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $\\$185$ million. The Cubico II wind complex is recorded in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nAgua Clara — On June 17, 2022, the Company, through its subsidiaries AES Dominicana Renewable Energy and AES Andres DR, S.A., acquired $85\\%$ of the equity interests in Agua Clara, S.A.S., a wind project, for consideration of $\\$98$ million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. As Agua Clara is not a VIE, any difference between the fair value of the assets and consideration transferred was allocated to PP&E on a relative fair value basis. Agua Clara is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment."

The transaction includes operating wind assets spread across six sites and will complement AES Clean Energy’s existing operating and development solar and energy storage assets in the state of New York. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date were recorded at their fair values, which resulted in the recognition of $\\$199$ million of goodwill. This goodwill represents the opportunity to repower the acquired assets and thus obtain additional cash flows from the asset group. The Company has recorded preliminary amounts for the purchase price allocation in 2021. New York Wind is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of Cogentrix Valcour Intermediate Holdings, LLC.

As a result, the estimated acquisition-date carrying value and fair values of the sPower development assets transferred were increased, which resulted in the recognition of an additional $\\$178$ million gain, for an updated gain of $\\$214$ million. Furthermore, the estimated goodwill as of the acquisition date was reduced to $\\$45$ million, as a result of adjustments to the fair value of the consideration paid and updates to the fair values of separately identifiable intangible assets. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2021, which did not result in any material measurement period adjustments. \nSubsequent to the closing of the transaction, AES holds a $75\\%$ ownership interest in AES Clean Energy Development. AIMCo holds the remaining $25\\%$ minority interest along with certain partnership rights, though currently not in effect, that would enable AIMCo to exit in the future.

The fair value of the initial consideration paid to acquire Great Cove I and Great Cove II was $\\$13$ million and $\\$24$ million, which included contingent consideration liabilities of $\\$6$ million and $\\$22$ million, respectively. These acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration. During the third quarter of 2021, the contingent liabilities which related primarily to certain price adjustment features were remeasured, resulting in contingent consideration assets of $\\$2$ million and $\\$12$ million for Great Cove I and Great Cove II, respectively. This remeasurement resulted in a gain of $\\$32$ million recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the third quarter of 2021. In October 2021, the Company amended the agreement, resulting in the reclassification of the previously contingent consideration assets to Prepaid Expenses. In December 2021, the Company acquired Community Energy, LLC (as further described above), and such remaining prepaid amounts were written off to Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Great Cove Solar is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. \nVentus Wind Complex — In December 2020, AES Brasil completed the acquisition of the Ventus Wind Complex (\"Ventus\") for $\\$90$ million, including $\\$3$ million of working capital adjustments. At closing, the Company made an initial cash payment of $\\$44$ million. The remainder was paid in the second and third quarter of 2021. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition; therefore, the total amount of consideration, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Ventus is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment. \nPenonome I — In May 2020, AES Panama completed the acquisition of the Penonome I wind farm from Goldwind International for $\\$80$ million.

Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs, stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs and stock options, and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units. \nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, where income represents the numerator and weightedaverage shares represent the denominator."

These shares could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. Had the Company generated income, potential shares of common stock of 3 million and 4 million related to the stock awards and 40 million and 33 million related to the Equity Units, would have been included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \nAs described in Note 17—Equity, the Company issued 10,430,500 Equity Units in March 2021 with a total notional value of $\\$1,043$ million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $\\$100$ and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a 2024 Purchase Contract and a $10\\%$ undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock. Prior to February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted at the option of the holder only in connection with a fundamental change. On and after February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted freely at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to the holder with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock being converted (i) a share of our Series B Preferred Stock, or, solely with respect to conversions in connection with a redemption, cash and (ii) shares of our common stock, if any, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the liquidation preference of the preferred stock being converted. The conversion rate is initially 31.5428 shares of common stock per one share of Series A Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\\$31.70$ per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, due to customary anti-dilution provisions, the conversion rate was 31.5846, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $\\$31.66$ per share of common stock. The Series A Preferred Stock and the 2024 Purchase Contracts are being accounted for as one unit of account. In calculating diluted EPS, the Company has applied the if-converted method to determine the impact of the forward purchase feature and considered if there are incremental shares that should be included related to the Series A Preferred conversion value. \n# \nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18—Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage. \nOperating and Economic Risks — The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $\\$1.4$ billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents."

        "text": "During 2022, $68\\%$ of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations, particularly the operation, financing, and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: \n• economic, social, and political instability in any particular country or region; inability to economically hedge energy prices;   \n• volatility in commodity prices;   \n· adverse changes in currency exchange rates;   \n• government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds; unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies; high inflation and monetary fluctuations; restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas, or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate; threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations, or other counterparties to honor their commitments; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts, or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageo to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative, and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy; potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions; difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and inability to obtain financing on expected terms. \nAny of these factors, individually or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. \nOur inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonable increases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: \n• changes in the determination, definition, or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs changes in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or changes in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses."

        "text": "Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our results of operations. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic — The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets.The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this time and may have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. \nAlto Maipo — On August 27, 2021, Alto Maipo updated its creditors with respect to the construction budget and long-term business plan for the project, which considers different scenarios for spot prices, decarbonization initiatives, and hydrological conditions, among other significant variables. Under some of these scenarios, Alto Maipo may experience reduced future cash flows, which would limit its ability to repay debt. Alto Maipo’s management initiated negotiations with its creditors to restructure its obligations and achieve a sustainable long-term capital structure for Alto Maipo. On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA commenced a reorganization proceeding in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, through a voluntary petition. Consequently, after the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is no longer considered to have control over Alto Maipo, which resulted in its deconsolidation. The Company recognized an after-tax loss of approximately $\\$1.2$ billion, net of noncontrolling interests, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2021, associated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest. \nOn May 26, 2022, Alto Maipo emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Alto Maipo, as restructured, is considered a VIE. As the Company lacks the power to make significant decisions, it does not meet the criteria to be considered the primary beneficiary of Alto Maipo and therefore will not consolidate this entity. The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Alto Maipo. If Alto Maipo is unable to meet its obligations under the restructured arrangements as they come due, the creditors may enforce their rights under the credit agreements. These finance agreements are non-recourse with respect to The AES Corporation. \nForeign Currency Risks — AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Dominican peso, the Euro, the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso. \nConcentrations — Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted for $10\\%$ or more of total revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \nThe cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs and/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms. \n# \nCertain of our businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic are partially owned by governments either directly or through stateowned institutions. In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. At two of our generation businesses in Mexico, the offtakers exercise significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' Boards of Directors. These offtakers are also required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. Furthermore, in 2021, the Company began construction projects with Fluence relating to energy storage. These related party transactions primarily present themselves as construction in progress as seen below. Additionally, the Company provides certain support and management services to several of its affiliates under various agreements. \nThe Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations included the following transactions with related parties for the periods indicated (in millions):"

Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \n# \nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: \n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effec on the financial statements are prevented or detected timely. \nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates. \nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. \nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: \nThere were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."

In our opinion, The AES Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n# \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai easonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n# \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nTysons, Virginia March 1, 2023"
