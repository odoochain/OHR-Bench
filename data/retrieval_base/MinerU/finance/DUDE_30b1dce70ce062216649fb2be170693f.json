        "text": "# \nTO THE SHAREHOLDERS: \nAccompanying this leteris the Balance Sheet of the A. C. Lawrence Leather Company, showing its hnancial position on October 26,1946, together with Statements of Income and Surplus for the fiscal year ended that date. After all costs and expenses, including interest and reserves for federal, state, and other taxes, and certain other reserves, net earnings are \\$1,435,144. Although our year-end inventory was slightly higher in dollars than at the beginning of the year, most of our major departments had a smaller unit inventory than a year ago. To provide against price decline, and for the replacement of basic inventoris carried on Lastin First-out basis, a reserve of \\$475,000 was set up. \nNineteen hundred forty-six is the fth year during which the industry has operated at ceiling prices on raw materials and fnished leathers. With some slight exceptions, during the five-year period ceiling prices have remained unchanged. Since the close of our fiscal year, all price controls on hides, skins, leathers, and shoes have been removed. \nSince October 26, 1946, prices of raw hides and skins have increased practically one hunded entiningthmfarlylseworld prichichhavebeenfectdrin sumer andfalLeatherpricehaveadvancdinnewiththencreasinrawmateraost andleathersngoddemand atcurentcreasedpricExcptoreriodduringand shor after the frst World War, raw hide and skin prices have never been so high as they are at the present time and how long these or higher price levels will be maintained we have no way of knowing. We do,however,know that articlesmade out of leather, such as shoes, must sell at substantially higher prices if present markets on hides and leather are maintained. \nAll during 1946 we continued to operate under Government allocation of raw material. As a result of the control of meat prices, products were diverted from normal channels and domestic kill was reduced radically from the spring on, resulting in continually curtailed Government allocations. Our raw stock inventories were so low that the small quantities allocated to us made it no longer possible for us to continue to operate at previous.levels and our curtailment in production consequently became very serious, particularly during the fall months. When meat was decontrolled, kill increased and products again began to flow in normal channels, resulting in the removal of Government allocations so that now we fnd ourselves able to buy freely, although at high prices, and our former rate of operations is gradually being resumed. \nBecause of the uncertainties in the national situation, 1946 has been a most diffcult year in which to operate but your company has the advantage of an experienced organization, which has been of tremendous help under extremely trying conditions. \nThe condition of our plants has never been as good as it is at the present time and our organization is continually y working to improve methods and also operating conditions of our employes. Our superintendents and foremen are able and experienced in producing quality merchandise at competitive costs and we are appreciative of the cooperation and efforts of our employes throughout thecompany. \nWith the resumption in the free flow of leather supplies, we have reason to believe that our customers and the consuming public will welcome a resumption of increased quantities of leather articles and on this basis we anticipate that 1947 wilf show a continued demand for the products of our tanneries. \nRespectfully submitted, HAROLD N. GOODSPEED, President \nPeabody, Mass.   \nDecember 12, 1946."
