The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of $1.69\\%$ , compared with $2.02\\%$ in the prior year.   \n• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $\\$7.8$ billion at June 30, 2022, a net decrease of $\\$2.0$ billion from the prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance in consumer and net portfolio activity in wholesale.   \n• Firmwide average loans of $\\$1.1$ trillion were up $7\\%$ , driven by higher loans across the LOBs.   \n• Firmwide average deposits of $\\$2.5$ trillion were up $9\\%$ , reflecting the residual impact associated with government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. However, during the second quarter of 2022, there was a decline in deposits, including in CB due to migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, and in CCB as consumer spending continued to grow. \n# \n• The Firm’s CET1 capital was $\\$207$ billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were $12.2\\%$ and $12.9\\%$ , respectively.   \n• The Firm’s SLR was $5.3\\%$ .   \n• The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the second quarter of 2022 at $\\$69.53$ , up $1\\%$ versus the prior year. \nPre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed basis are non-GAAP financial measures.

These were largely offset by net issuances in Treasury and CIO and CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 for additional information. \nStockholders’ equity decreased as a result of a net unrealized loss in AOCI, which was predominantly driven by the impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO.

        "text": "The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. \nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed basis. \n# \nResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. \n# \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenuesharing agreements. \nFunds transfer pricing   \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. \nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. \n# \nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 47, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. \nRefer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies."

        "text": "Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • Firmwide structures for risk governance. \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. \n# \nThe Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. \n# \n\nRefer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. \n# \nThe following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2021 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm's business activities. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nRiskgovernance and oversightfunctions & Form10-Q page reference & Form10-K page reference \\\\\nStrategic risk &  & 85 \\\\\nCapital risk & 44-49 & 86-96 \\\\\nLiquidity risk & 50-54 & 97-104 \\\\\nReputation risk &  & 105 \\\\\nConsumercreditrisk & 57-61 & 110-116 \\\\\nWholesalecreditrisk & 62-70 & 117-128 \\\\\nInvestmentportfoliorisk & 74 & 132 \\\\\nMarket risk & 75-79 & 133-140 \\\\\nCountry risk & 80-81 & 141-142 \\\\\nOperationalrisk & 82 & 143-149 \\\\\nCompliance risk &  & 146 \\\\\nConduct risk &  & 147 \\\\\nLegal risk &  & 148 \\\\\nEstimationsand Modelrisk &  & 149 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. \nRefer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10- K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s capital risk. \n# \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios. \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to SLR on page 47 for additional information. \n# \nCECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition provisions, which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, the $\\$2.9$ billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being phased out at $25\\%$ per year over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining $\\$2.2$ billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. \nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out $25\\%$ of the other relevant CECL capital transition provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance. \nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $\\$40$ billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized. \nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is $12.5\\%$ by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. This target is based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect, and taking into account the expected increase in the Firm's Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement."

Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. \nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Average amount} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Three months ended} \\\\\n & June 30, 2022 & March 31, 2022 & June 30, 2021 \\\\\nJPMorganChase\\&Co.: HQLA \\\\\nEligible cash(a) & 634,480 & $6 680,003 & 673,724 \\\\\nEligible securities(b)(c) Total HQLA(d) & 107,473 & 42,512 & 42,832 \\\\\nNetcashoutflows & 741,953 676,234 & $ 722,515 $ 658,998 & $ 716,556 \\\\\nLCR & 110% & 110 % & $ 647,757 111 % \\\\\nNet excess eligible \\\\\nHQLA & 65,719 & $ 63,517 & $ 68,799 \\\\\nJPMorganChaseBankN.A.: \\\\\nLCR & 169 % & 181 % & 171 % \\\\\nNetexcesseligibleHQLA$487,867 &  & $ 560,987 & $L 489,311 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks.   \n(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.   \n(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.   \n(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared with the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA primarily from a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in the market value of HQLA-eligible investment securities in \nTreasury and CIO. Refer to Note 9 for additional information regarding gross unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities portfolio. \nThe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. \n# \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $\\$826$ billion and $\\$914$ billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above. \nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $\\$308$ billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. \n# \nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. \nAs of June 30, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the $100\\%$ minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in 2023."

        "text": "# \n# \nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both shortand long-term cash requirements. \nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured \nlong-term debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. \nRefer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance sheet obligations. \n# \nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the average deposit balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multirow{2}{*}{June30,} & \\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{ThreemonthsendedJune30,} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{SixmonthsendedJune30,} \\\\\n &  &  & December31, & Average &  & Average \\\\\n(in millions) & 2022 &  & 2021 & 2022 & 2021 & 2022 & 2021 \\\\\nConsumer\\&CommunityBanking$1 & 1,178,825 & $ & 1,148,110 $ & 1,180,453 $ & 1,047,771 & $1 1,167,057 & $ 1,013,917 \\\\\nCorporate\\&InvestmentBank & 738,795 &  & 707,791 & 773,664 & 765,807 & 765,200 & 756,499 \\\\\nCommercialBanking & 283,296 &  & 323,954 & 300,339 & 290,095 & 308,518 & 290,455 \\\\\nAsset\\&WealthManagement & 257,437 &  & 282,052 & 268,861 & 219,699 & 278,256 & 213,167 \\\\\nCorporate & 13,191 &  & 396 & 8,995 & 423 & 4,948 & 450 \\\\\nTotalFirm & $ 2,471,544 & $ & 2,462,303 $ & 2,532,312 & $ 2,323,795 & $2 2,523,979 & $ 2,274,488 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. \nThe table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(inbillionsexceptratios) & June30,2022 & December31,2021 \\\\\nDeposits & 2,471.5 & 2,462.3 \\\\\nDepositsasa%oftotalliabilities & 70% & 71 % \\\\\nLoans & 1,104.2 & 1,077.7 \\\\\nLoans-to-depositsratio & 45 % & 44 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. \nAverage deposits increased for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting the residual impact associated with government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. However, during the second quarter of 2022, there was a decline in deposits, including in CB due to migration of nonoperating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, and in CCB as consumer spending continued to grow. \nAverage deposits increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting inflows across the LOBs resulting from the residual effect of certain government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. \nIncreases in Corporate predominantly relate to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives. \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 15-16 and pages 20-42, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends."

Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance. Net recoveries for the three months ended June 30, 2022 were lower when compared with the same period in the prior year as the current year recoveries were impacted by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates. Net recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were relatively flat compared with the same period in the prior year. \nLoans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as Home Lending warehouse loan sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and lower loan purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by CIB. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $\\$16.9$ billion at June 30, 2022. This amount included $\\$5.5$ billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $\\$5.5$ billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. \nAt June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $\\$34.4$ billion and $\\$30.0$ billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higherbalance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2022 on a loan sale and net recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-forsale and loans at fair value.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.

As of June 30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming exposure was driven by a decline in lending related commitments as a result of net portfolio activity, predominantly in CIB, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming derivatives.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchangetraded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. \nThe percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately $87\\%$ and $88\\%$ at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$81.3$ billion and $\\$57.1$ billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was driven by higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. \nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. \nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. \nThe benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. \nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements."

        "text": "The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,   \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and   \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance   \nThe allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2022 was $\\$20.0$ billion, an increase of $\\$1.3$ billion from   \nDecember 31, 2021, consisting of: $\\$1.0$ billion in wholesale and $\\$311$ million in consumer. \n\nThe change in allowance reflects the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year, due to the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance was also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in the second quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russiaassociated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter of 2022. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates above $4\\%$ through the fourth quarter of 2023, and a $1.1\\%$ lower U.S. real GDP level exiting the fourth quarter of 2023. \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{AssumptionsatJune30,2022} \\\\\n & 4Q22 & 2Q23 & 4Q23 \\\\\nu.S.unemploymentrate (a & 3.6 % & 3.6 % & 3.7 % \\\\\nYoY growth in u.S.real GDp(b) & 1.3 % & 1.7 % & 1.2 % \\\\\n & AssumptionsatDecember31,2021 \\\\\n & 2Q22 & 4Q22 & 2Q23 \\\\\nu.S.unemployment rate (a & 4.2 % \\\\\n &  & 4.0 % & 3.9 % \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDp(b) & 3.1 % & 2.8 % & 2.1 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. \nModels used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses.

The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a $95\\%$ confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. \nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors.

        "text": "# \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. \nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K. \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. \n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing. \n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information). \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(in billions) & June30, 2022 & December31, 2021 \\\\\nParallel shift: \\\\\n+100bpsshiftinrates & (1.4) $ & 5.0 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinrates & (1.0) & NM (a) \\\\\nSteeperyieldcurve: \\\\\n+100bpsshiftinlong-termrates & 0.5 & 1.8 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinshort-termrates & (0.4) & NM (a) \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: \\\\\n+10obpsshiftinshort-termrates & (1.8) & 3.2 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinlong-termrates & (0.6) & NM (a) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. \nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. \nAs of June 30, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the $+100$ basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a $_{1+100}$ basis points shift in long-term rates and the -100 basis points shift in rates are primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing. \nThe Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(in billions) & June30, 2022 & December31, 2021 \\\\\nParallelshift: \\\\\n+1o0bpsshiftinrates & 0.9 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinrates & (0.8) & NM \\\\\nSteeperyieldcurve: -100bpsshiftinshort-termrates & (0.8) & NM (a) \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: +1oobpsshiftinshort-termrates & 0.8 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. \nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021."

Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. \nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation. \nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables). \nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country.

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • The allowance for lending-related commitments, and • The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 71-73 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. \n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP. • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI. \nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 71 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately $2.2\\%$ higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $3.7\\%$ in the second quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly $2.9\\%$ lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $5.8\\%$ in the second quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of $17.6\\%$ in the first quarter of 2024. \nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: \n• The allowance as of June 30, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables."

        "text": "• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. \nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30, 2022, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: \n• An increase of approximately $\\$600$ million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of approximately $\\$2.0$ billion for credit card loans • An increase of approximately $\\$3.0$ billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. \nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2022. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. \n# \nThe following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

        "text": "# \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \n# \nThe credit card rewards liability was $\\$10.6$ billion and $\\$9.8$ billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. \n# \nRefer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. \n# \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. \nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. \nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. \n# \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. \nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented."

The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. \n# \nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date."

Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.   \n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $\\$803$ million, nonagency securities of $\\$14$ million and non-trading loans of $\\$914$ million.   \n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $\\$10$ million, trading loans of $\\$40$ million and non-trading loans of $\\$368$ million.   \n(d) Comprises trading loans of $\\$858$ million and non-trading loans of $\\$738$ million.   \n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.   \n(f) Includes equity securities of $\\$918$ million including $\\$257$ million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.   \n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on pricebased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $\\$100$ .   \n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.   \n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used."

When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments."

Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life.

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. \nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: \n• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;   \n• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and   \n• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.   \n(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.   \n(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained.

Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty.   \n(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.   \n(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $\\$64.6$ billion and $\\$67.6$ billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements.

The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP.

The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.   \n(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.   \n(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.   \n(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.   \n(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.   \n(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.   \n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly crosscurrency basis spreads.

For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately eight years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities."

Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. Th estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, seven years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations."

In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. \nAt June 30, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). \n# \nAt June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $\\$696$ million and $\\$619$ million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure."

These transactions are conducted at arm’slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. \n# \nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing \nmember and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\\$27.5$ billion and $\\$26.8$ billion, of which $\\$9.8$ billion and $\\$9.4$ billion was unfunded at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary.

In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. \nThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(inmillions,exceptrates) & Jun30, 2022 & Dec31, 2021 \\\\\n(constantprepaymentrate) Impactonfairvalueof1o%adversechange & 6.72 % & 9.90% \\\\\nImpactonfairvalueof2o%adversechange & $(189) (366) & $ (210) (404) \\\\\nWeighted-average option adjusted spread(a) Impactonfairvalueofa1oobasispoint & 5.79% & 6.44 % \\\\\nadversechange Impactonfairvalueofa2o0basispoint & $(318) & $(225) \\\\\nadversechange & (611) & (433) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital."

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. \nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower."

This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. \nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $\\$31.5$ million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $\\$25$ million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. \nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $\\$1.1$ billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $\\$875$ million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. The FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately $\\$75$ million. \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded"

        "text": "guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need the Department of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. \nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $\\$10$ million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the tribunal has denied a request by the proposed class representatives for class certification on an opt-out basis. \nInquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements. In December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective civil investigations of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain communications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping rules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. \nMorgan Securities LLC paid a $\\$125$ million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $\\$75$ million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to requests for information and other material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. \nIn March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities laws based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise adequate oversight over compliance with records preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. \nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $\\$900$ million to the approximately $\\$5.3$ billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\\$700$ million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. \nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending."

        "text": "LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. \nMetals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. \nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. \nAcross the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $\\$920$ million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. \nSeveral putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to precious metals. \nIn October 2020, two putative class action complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the abovereferenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss. \nIn May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against certain current and former officers and directors of the Firm.  The complaint claims the Firm’s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the shareholder’s demand to commence litigation and seeks"

        "text": "damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms on the basis of alleged supervisory failures with regard to certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. \nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. \n\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. \nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $\\$73$ million and $\\$185$ million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $\\$192$ million and $\\$213$ million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into \naccount its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. \n# \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the \n# \nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed basis. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

        "text": "# \nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: \nResults of Review of Interim Financial Statement We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. \n# \nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. \nAugust 3, 2022"

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative).

Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. \n# \nAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. \n# \nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. \n# \nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. \n# \nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories."

        "text": "Subprime \nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than $80\\%$ (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. \nMSR: Mortgage servicing rights \nNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. \nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. \nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net chargeoffs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. \nNet interchange income includes the following components: \nInterchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions.   \nRewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally tied to sales transactions.   \nPartner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions. \nNet yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. \nNFA: National Futures Association \nNM: Not meaningful \nNonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. \nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property. \nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss) OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit OTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally \nbetween two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer. \nOTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house. \nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. \nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. \nParticipating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. \nPCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. \nPillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA. \nPillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through disclosure requirements which allow market participants to assess the risk and capital profiles of banks. \nPPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Association (“SBA”) \nPRA: Prudential Regulation Authority \nPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. \nPrincipal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven marketmaking activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified riskmanagement activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives."
