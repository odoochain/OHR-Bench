Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of this Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information. \nComparisons noted in the sections below are for the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase reported net income of $\\$14.3$ billion for the first quarter of 2021, or $\\$4.50$ per share, on net revenue of $\\$32.3$ billion. The Firm reported ROE of $23\\%$ and ROTCE of $29\\%$ . The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $\\$5.2$ billion compared to an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $\\$6.8$ billion in the prior year, as well as a $\\$550$ million contribution to the Firm's Foundation. \n• Net income was $\\$14.3$ billion, up $\\$11.4$ billion. \n• Total net revenue was up $14\\%$ . Noninterest revenue was $\\$19.4$ billion, up $40\\%$ , predominantly driven by higher CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in the prior year. Net interest income was $\\$123$ billion, down $11\\%$ , predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates partially offset by balance sheet growth. \n• Noninterest expense was $\\$18.7$ billion, up $12\\%$ , predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenuerelated expense and continued investments in the businesses. The increase in expense also included a $\\$550$ million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.   \n• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $\\$4.2$ billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses of $\\$5.2$ billion, compared to an expense of $\\$8.3$ billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net additions to the allowance for credit losses of $\\$6.8$ billion.   \n• The total allowance for credit losses was $\\$25.6$ billion at March 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of $2.42\\%$ , compared with $2.95\\%$ in the fourth quarter of 2020, and $2.32\\%$ in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the allowance for loan losses.   \n• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $\\$10.3$ billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $\\$3.2$ billion from the prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, nonperforming assets decreased $\\$649$ million from December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.   \n• Firmwide average loans of $\\$1.0$ trillion were up $1\\%$ , driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) in CCB and CB.   \n• Firmwide average deposits of $\\$2.2$ trillion were up $36\\%$ , reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n• As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High Quality Liquid Assets $\\mathrm{(^{64}H Q L A^{,\\eta})}$ of approximately $\\$697$ billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $\\$841$ billion, resulting in approximately $\\$1.5$ trillion of liquidity sources.

Refer to Note 1 for further information. \nInvestment banking fees increased across products in CIB, reflecting: \n• higher equity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO market due to increased industry-wide fees • higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of completed transactions, in part related to transactions announced in the second half of 2020, and • higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds and leveraged loans due to increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains. \nRefer to CIB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information. \nPrincipal transactions revenue increased, in part due to the absence of two significant items in the prior year: a $\\$951$ million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other; and an $\\$896$ million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB. \nExcluding these two items, principal transactions revenue increased in CIB driven by strong performance in: \n• Equity Markets across derivatives, Cash Equities, and prime brokerage, and   \n• Fixed Income Markets particularly in Securitized Products and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year. \nThe increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year. \nPrincipal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis. \nRefer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 33-34, and Note 5 for additional information. \nLending- and deposit-related fees decreased reflecting: \n• lower deposit-related fees in CCB given the higher deposits held in existing and new accounts,   \npredominantly offset by   \n• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees in CIB. \nRefer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages 23-27 and CB on pages 28-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. \nAsset management, administration and commissions revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees as a result of: \n• strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers, in AWM, and to a lesser extent, • higher levels of investment assets on higher average market levels and net inflows in CCB. \nRefer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 20-22 and pages 30-32, respectively, and Note 5 for information on asset management, administration and commissions revenue. \nInvestment securities gains in both periods reflected the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for information on investment securities gains. \nMortgage fees and related income increased predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production margins and volumes. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, Note 5 and 14 for further information. \nCard income increased driven by lower acquisition costs, and higher net interchange income in CCB, with debit and credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels.

        "text": "The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. \nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a definition of managed basis. \nDescription of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. \nRevenue sharing \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenuesharing agreements. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. \nRefer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies."

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • Firmwide structures for risk governance. \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. \n# \nThe Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. \n# \n\nRefer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. \n# \nThe following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2020 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nRiskgovernance and oversightfunctions & Form10-Q page reference & Form10-K page reference \\\\\nStrategic risk &  & 90 \\\\\nCapital risk & 36-41 & 91-101 \\\\\nLiquidity risk & 42-46 & 102-108 \\\\\nReputationrisk &  & 109 \\\\\nConsumercreditrisk & 48-52 & 114-120 \\\\\nWholesalecreditrisk & 53-62 & 121-131 \\\\\nInvestmentportfoliorisk & 65 & 134 \\\\\nMarket risk & 66-70 & 135-142 \\\\\nCountry risk & 71 & 143-144 \\\\\nOperationalrisk & 72 & 145-151 \\\\\nCompliance risk &  & 148 \\\\\nConduct risk &  & 149 \\\\\nLegal risk &  & 150 \\\\\nEstimationsandModelrisk & 73 & 151 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. \nThe Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. \nRefer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and stress testing. \n# \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (\"BHCs\") and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective minimum capital ratios. \nThe Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-riskbased ratios. \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional information. \n# \nCECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 (“CECL capital transition provisions”). \nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $\\$4.5$ billion, which is the $\\$2.7$ billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and $25\\%$ of the $\\$7.0$ billion increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD loans). \nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance. \nSLR temporary revision. The Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect through March 31, 2021. \nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and FDIC issued an interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this exclusion. \nPPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had approximately $\\$32$ billion of loans under the program. \nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending (“PPPL”) Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude them under the final rule. \nTLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total LossAbsorbing Capacity (\"TLAC\") debt instruments by certain large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC debt instruments issued by systemically important banking organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics."

The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule. \nThe Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. \n# \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $\\$841$ billion and $\\$740$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits. \nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $\\$301$ billion and $\\$307$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. \n# \nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least $100\\%$ on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023. \nThe Firm estimates that it is compliant with the $100\\%$ minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based on its current understanding of the final rule."

        "text": "# \n# \nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. \nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or longterm secured borrowings, through the issuance of \nunsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and shortterm secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. \n# \nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and the average deposit balances for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\n &  &  & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{ThreemonthsendedMarch31,} \\\\\nDeposits & March31, & December31, & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Average} \\\\\n(in millions) & 2021 & 2020 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nConsumer\\&CommunityBanking & $ 1,037,903 & 958,706 & $ 979,686 & 739,709 \\\\\nCorporate\\&InvestmentBank & 726,708 & 702,215 & 747,087 & 562,226 \\\\\nCommercialBanking & 295,748 & 284,263 & 290,818 & 188,683 \\\\\nAsset\\&WealthManagement & 217,460 & 198,755 & 206,562 & 144,570 \\\\\nCorporate & 293 & 318 & 479 & 998 \\\\\nTotalFirm & $ 2,278,112 & $ 2,144,257 & $2 2,224,632 & $1,636,186 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. \nThe table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n(inbillionsexceptratios) & March31, 2021 &  & December31， 2020 \\\\\nDeposits & 2,278.1 & $ & 2,144.3 \\\\\nDepositsasa%oftotalliabilities & 67% &  & 69% \\\\\nLoans & 1,011.3 & $ & 1,012.9 \\\\\nLoans-to-depositsratio &  & 44% & 47 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. \nAverage deposits increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as growth from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers. \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 18-34 and pages 12-13, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends."

Retained nonaccrual loans were relatively flat from December 31, 2020. Net recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were lower when compared with the same period in the prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale in Home Lending. \nThe loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value portfolio increased from December 31, 2020 largely driven by warehouse loans in Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to sales in CIB. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $\\$23.2$ billion at March 31, 2021.

These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higherbalance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were consistent with the broader residential mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is generally in line with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.

The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses. \n\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\n(in millions,except ratios) & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{March31,2021} & December31,2020 & September30,2020 & June30,2020 \\\\\n & Loan balance & Percent of total industryloan balance (q） & IGpercentage of loan balance in paymentdeferral & Loan balance &  & Loan balance \\\\\nIndustry RealEstate & 407 & 0.35 % & 6 % & 550 & Loan balance 4,385 & 5,211 \\\\\nTransportation & 369 & 5.94 & 98 & 394 & 346 & 294 \\\\\nIndustrials & 18 & 0.09 &  & 19 & 91 & 335 \\\\\nConsumerandRetail & 15 & 0.04 &  & 82 & 413 & 690 \\\\\nIndividualsandIndividual Entities &  & 0.01 & 100 \\\\\nAutomotive &  &  &  & 402 22 & 691 15 & 809 8,827 \\\\\nHealthcare &  &  &  &  & 100 & 300 \\\\\nAll Other Industries(a) &  & 0.26 & 77 & 147 & 233 & 309 \\\\\nTotal wholesale &  &  &  &  & 6,274 & 16,775 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) As of March 31, 2021, predominantly SPEs. (b) Represents the balance of the retained loans which were still under payment deferral, divided by the respective industry total retained loans balance. \nIn addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing. \n# \nThe following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility.

Total criticized exposure excluding loans heldfor-sale and loans at fair value, was $\\$40.9$ billion at March 31, 2021, compared with $\\$41.6$ billion at December 31, 2020, representing approximately $4.4\\%$ and $4.0\\%$ of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The increase in total criticized exposure was driven by select downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades . The total criticized exposure was largely undrawn and $\\$42.8$ billion was performing."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. \nThe percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately $88\\%$ at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$73.1$ billion and $\\$79.6$ billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables for the counterparty.

        "text": "The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,   \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and   \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of: \n• a $\\$4.5$ billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and   \n• a $\\$716$ million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios \nWhile the economy is showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances. \nFurther, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross \ndomestic product (\"GDP\") returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22. \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{AssumptionsatMarch31,2021} \\\\\n & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\nU.S. unemployment rate(a) & 5.7 % & 4.8 % & 4.3 % \\\\\nCumulative changeinu.s.real GDPfr0m12/31/2019 & 0.2 % & 2.7 % & 4.3 % \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{AssumptionsatDecember31,2020} \\\\\n & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\nU.S. unemployment rate(a) & 6.8 % & 5.7 % & 5.1 % \\\\\nCumulative changeinu.S.real GDPfr0m12/31/2019 & (1.9)% & 0.6 % & 2.0 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. \nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods. \nRefer to Note 13  and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities. \nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 74-76 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments. \nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 48-52, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 and Note 11 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios."

        "text": "Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held non-traded financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. \n# \nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $\\$595.4$ billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was $\\mathsf{A A+}$ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. \nMarket Risk Management continues to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and controls. \nModels used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses.

For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 73. \nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a $95\\%$ confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.

        "text": "# \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. \nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information). \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(in billions) & March31, 2021 & December31. 2020 \\\\\nParallelshift: \\\\\n+1o0bpsshiftinrates & 6.0 & $ \\\\\nSteeperyieldcurve: +10obpsshiftinlong-termrates & 1.6 & 2.4 \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: \\\\\n+10obpsshiftinshort-termrates & 4.4 & 4.5 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. \nThe Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits. \nBased upon current and implied market rates as of March 31, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earningsat-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income. In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require additional management judgment and therefore, the actual outcomes may differ from these assumptions. \nThe Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n(inbillions) & March31, 2021 &  & December31, 2020 \\\\\nParallelshift: \\\\\n+100bpsshiftinrates & $ & 0.9 & 0.9 \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: +10obps shiftin short-termrates &  & 0.9 & 0.8 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020."

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • The allowance for lending-related commitments, and The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63–64 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest \neffect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. \n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP. • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI. \nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that  affected borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery. \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate through 2021, averaging $2.4\\%$ higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $4.4\\%$ in the third quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining $2.6\\%$ lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of nearly $6.6\\%$ in the third quarter of 2021; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of $17.4\\%$ and a trough in the second quarter of 2022."

Without considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison between these two scenarios reflects the following differences: \n• An increase of approximately $\\$700$ million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of approximately $\\$3.6$ billion for credit card loans • An increase of approximately $\\$2.1$ billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. \nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its \nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2021. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. \n# \nThe following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\nMarch31,2021 (in billions, except ratios) & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Total assets at fair value} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Total level 3 assets} \\\\\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased underresale agreements Securities borrowed Trading assets: & $ & 267.6 66.3 & $ \\\\\nTrading-debt and equity instruments Derivative receivables(a) & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{$ 470.9} \\\\\nTotal trading assets & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{73.1 544.0} & 7.9 10.6 \\\\\nAFS securities Loans & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{379.9 50.8} & 1.8 \\\\\nMSRS Other & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{4.5 383.7} & 4.5 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Totalassetsmeasuredatfairvalueon arecurringbasis 1,362.9} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{0.5 17.4} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{0.7} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Totalassetsmeasuredatfairvalue $} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2.5} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Total Firm assets $} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{1,365.4 $ 18.1 3,689.3} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets(a)} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{0.5 %} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Level3assetsatfairvalueasa percentage of total Firm assets atfair value(a)} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{} \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $\\$7.9$ billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral."

        "text": "# \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \n# \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment. \nRefer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2021. \n# \nThe credit card rewards liability was $\\$8.0$ billion and $\\$7.7$ billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. \n# \nRefer to Income taxes on page 154-155 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. \n# \nRefer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves."

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. \nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. \nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis. \n# \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. \nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities."

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value.

        "text": "discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).   \n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $\\$678$ million and $\\$670$ million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, were trading assets of $\\$55$ million and $\\$52$ million, respectively, and other assets of $\\$623$ million and $\\$618$ million, respectively.   \n(e) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included within loans were $\\$20.1$ billion and $\\$15.1$ billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $\\$6.0$ billion and $\\$6.3$ billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $\\$11.9$ billion and $\\$8.4$ billion, respectively.   \n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.   \n(g) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. \n\n# \nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date."

When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments."

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. \nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: \n• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. Liquid securities represent high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;   \n• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and   \n• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.   \n(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.   \n(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty.   \n(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.   \n(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $\\$74.6$ billion and $\\$89.0$ billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. \nLiquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{March31,2021} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{December31,2020} \\\\\n & Single-notch downgrade & Two-notch downgrade & Single-notch downgrade & Two-notch downgrade \\\\\nAmount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) & 178 & 1,448 & 119 & 1,243 \\\\\n & 127 & 833 & 153 & 1,682 (c) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.

The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020."

        "text": "# \nThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. \nFair value hedge gains and losses   \nThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.   \n(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.   \n(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in ne interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.   \n(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.   \n(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.   \n(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.   \n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly crosscurrency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.   \n(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $\\$16.1$ billion and $\\$11.5$ billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.   \n(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $\\$15.5$ billion and $\\$14.5$ billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $\\$6.4$ billion and $\\$6.6$ billion, respectively.   \n(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.   \n(d) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from q hedging relationships.   \n(e) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\n & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{Gains/(losses) recorded inincome} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Incomestatementimpactof excluded components(e)} & OClimpact \\\\\nThreemonthsendedMarch31,2021 (in millions) & Derivatives & Hedged items & impact & Income statement & Amortization approach & Changes in fair value & Derivatives - Gains/(losses) recorded in oci(f) \\\\\nContract type \\\\\nInterest rate(a)(b) & $ & (5,121) $ & 5,446 $ & 325 &  & 436 18 \\\\\nForeign exchange(c) &  & (729) & 747 & 18 & (78) &  & (37) \\\\\nCommodity(d) &  & (1,261) & 1,288 & 27 & 一 & 12 \\\\\nTotal & $ & (7,111) $ & 7,481 $ & 370 & (78) $ & 466 & (37) \\\\\n & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{Gains/(losses) recorded inincome} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Income statement impact of excludedcomponents} \\\\\nThree months endedMarch31,2020 (in millions) & Derivatives &  & Hedged items & Income statement impact & Amortization approach & Changes in fair value & Derivatives - Gains/(losses) recorded in oci(f) \\\\\nContract type \\\\\nInterest rate(a)(b) & $ & 4,087 & (3,788) $ & 299 &  & 214 \\\\\nForeign exchange(c) &  & 576 & (488) & 88 & (179) & 88 & 115 \\\\\nCommodity(d) &  & 1,528 & (1,482) & 46 &  & 49 \\\\\nTotal & $ & 6,191 $ & (5,758) $ & 433 & (179) $ & 351 & 115 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. Th estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations."

The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: \nthey represent short-term or other insignificant   \nmodifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or   \nthe Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. \nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. \nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses. \nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status."

Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. \nAt March 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years.

This typical occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. \n# \nCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of TDRs was $\\$1.2$ billion and $\\$954$ million as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $\\$428$ million  and $\\$76$ million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The new TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020."

        "text": "Discussion of changes in the allowance \nThe allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of: \n• a $\\$4.5$ billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and   \na $\\$716$ million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios \nWhile the economy is showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances. \nFurther, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22. \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{AssumptionsatMarch31,2021} \\\\\n & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\nu.S.unemploymentrate (a） & 5.7 % & 4.8 % & 4.3 % \\\\\nCumulative changeinu.S.real GDPfr0m12/31/2019 & 0.2 % & 2.7 % & 4.3 % \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & AssumptionsatDecember31,2020 \\\\\n & 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22 \\\\\nU.S. unemployment rate(a) & 6.8 % & 5.7 % & 5.1 % \\\\\nCumulativechangeinu.S.real GDPfr0m12/31/2019 & (1.9)% & 0.6 % & 2.0 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. \nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods."

The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\\$23.1$ billion and $\\$23.6$ billion, of which $\\$8.5$ billion and $\\$8.7$ billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on offbalance sheet lending-related commitments."

        "text": "Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. \nIn those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. \nThe Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $\\$6.5$ billion and $\\$6.7$ billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, was $\\$10.2$ billion and $\\$10.5$ billion, respectively. \n# \nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations. \n# \nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\n & \\multicolumn{6}{l}{ThreemonthsendedMarch31,} \\\\\n & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2021} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2020} \\\\\n(in millions) & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Residential mortgage (P）} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Residential Commercial mortgage （d) and other(e)} \\\\\nPrincipalsecuritized & $ & 4,077 & 1,912 & $ & 3,064 $ & 3,188 \\\\\nAll cash flows during the period:(a) \\\\\n & $ & 4,234$ & 1,970 & $ & 3,136 $ & 3,273 \\\\\nServicingfeescollected &  & 41 &  &  & 62 \\\\\nCashflowsreceivedoninterests &  & 183 & 52 &  & 117 & 29 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs."

The Firm has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of March 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020."

        "text": "# \nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs. \nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{As of or for the three months ended March 31,} \\\\\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted) & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nFair value at beginning of period & 3,276 & 4,699 \\\\\nMSR activity: \\\\\nOriginations of MSRs & 404 & 271 \\\\\nPurchase ofMSRs & 179 & 2 \\\\\nDisposition of MSRs(a) & 1 & (75) \\\\\nNet additions/(dispositions) & 584 & 198 \\\\\nChanges due to collection/realization of expected cash flows & (187) & (248) \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: \\\\\nChanges due to market interest rates and other(b) & 836 & (1,370) \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: \\\\\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) & (24) & (1) \\\\\nDiscount rates Prepayment model changes and other(c) & 一 \\\\\nTotal changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions & (15) & (11) \\\\\nTotal changes in valuation due toinputs and assumptions & (39) & (12) \\\\\nFair value at March 31, & 797 & (1,382) \\\\\n & $ 4,470 & 3,267 \\\\\nChanges in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MsRs held at March 31, & $ 797 & (1,382) \\\\\nContractual servicefees,latefees and otherancillaryfeesincluded inincome & 291 & 364 \\\\\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at March 31, (in billions) Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at March 31, (in billions)(d) & 444 & 506 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”).

The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements."

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. \nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower."

        "text": "# \n# \nAs of March 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. \nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $\\$0$ to approximately $\\$1.5$ billion at March 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \nthe number, variety and varying stages of the   \nproceedings, including the fact that many are in   \npreliminary stages,   \nthe existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,   \nthe numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class   \ncertification and the scope of many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential   \noutcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. \nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $\\$25$ million held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. \nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $\\$1.1$ billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $\\$875$ million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022. \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded"

        "text": "guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the tenyear disqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. \nIn August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $\\$10$ million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia. \nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $\\$900$ million to the approximately $\\$5.3$ billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\\$700$ million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. \n\nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Defendants opposed that motion, which remains pending. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval."

The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. \nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. \nAcross the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $\\$920$ million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. \nSeveral putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021. \nTwo putative class action complaints have also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the abovereferenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021. \nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. \nWendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan Chase’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. \nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future."

        "text": "The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $\\$28$ million and $\\$197$ million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. \n# \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to \npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed basis. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. \n# \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{As of or for the three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios) $} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Consumer \\& Community Banking} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Corporate \\& Investment Bank} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Commercial Banking} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Asset\\&WealthManagement} \\\\\n & 2021 & 2020 & 2021 & 2020 & 2021 & 2020 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nNoninterest revenue & 4,588 $ & 4,097 & $ 11,088 & $ 6,896 & $ 917 & $ 608 & $ 3,146 & $ 2,529 \\\\\nNet interest income & 7,929 & 9,190 & 3,517 & 3,107 & 1,476 & 1,557 & 931 & 860 \\\\\nTotal net revenue & 12,517 & 13,287 & 14,605 & 10,003 & 2,393 & 2,165 & 4,077 & 3,389 \\\\\nProvisionfor credit losses & (3,602) & 5,772 & (331) & 1,401 & (118) & 1,010 & (121) & 94 \\\\\nNoninterest expense & 7,202 & 7,269 & 7,104 & 5,955 & 969 & 986 & 2,574 & 2,435 \\\\\nIncome/(loss)beforeincome taxexpense/(benefit) \\\\\nIncometaxexpense/(benefit) & 8,917 2,189 & 246 & 7,832 & 2,647 & 1,542 & 169 & 1,624 & 860 \\\\\nNet income/(loss) $ & 6,728 $ & 49 197 & 2,092 $ & 662 $ 1,985 & 374 & 30 & 380 & 191 \\\\\nAverage equity $ & 50,000 $ & 52,000 & 5,740 & $ & $ 1,168 24,000 & $ 139 & $ 1,244 & $ 669 \\\\\nTotal assets &  & $ 513,352 & 83,000 & 80,000 & $ & $ 22,000 & $ 14,000 & $ 10,500 \\\\\nROE & 487,978 &  & 1,355,123 & 1,216,558 (b) & 223,583 & 247,786 & 213,088 & 178,897 \\\\\n & 54% & 1 % & 27 % & % 6 & 19 % & 2 % & 35 % & 25 % \\\\\nOverhead ratio & 58 & 55 & 49 & 60 & 40 & 46 & 63 & 72 \\\\\n &  &  & Corporate &  & Reconciling Items(a) \\\\\nAs of or for the three months ended March 31, (in millions,exceptratios) &  & 2021 & 2020 &  & 2021 & 2020 & Total \\\\\nNoninterest revenue &  & $ & 382 $ & 331 $ & (744) $ & (614) (b) $ & 2021 19,377 $ & 2020 (b) \\\\\nNet interest income &  & (855) &  & (165) & (109) & (110) & 12,889 & 13,847 14,439 \\\\\nTotal netrevenue &  & (473) &  & 166 & (853) & (724) & 32,266 & 28,286 \\\\\nProvision for credit losses &  &  & 16 & 8 & - &  & (4,156) & 8,285 \\\\\nNoninterest expense &  &  & 876 & 146 & 一 & 一 & 18,725 & 16,791 \\\\\nIncome/(loss) before income taxexpense/(benefit) &  & (1,365) &  & 12 & (853) & (724) & 17,697 & 3,210 \\\\\nIncome tax expense/(benefit) &  & (785) &  & 137 & (853) & (724) (b) & 3,397 & 345 (b) \\\\\nNet income/(loss) &  & $ (580) & $ (125) & $ & $ & 二 $ & 14,300 $ & 2,865 \\\\\nAverage equity &  & $ 74,542 & $ 70,030 & $ & 一 $ & $ & 245,542 $ & 234,530 \\\\\nTotal assets &  & 1,409,564 & 981,937 &  & NA & NA & 3,689,336 & 3,138,530 (b) \\\\\nROE &  &  & NM & NM & NM & NM & 23 % & 4 % \\\\\nOverhead ratio &  &  &  & NM & NM & NM &  & (b) \\\\\n &  &  & NM &  &  &  & 58 & 59 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. \n# \nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. \nMay 4, 2021"

Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. \nMaster netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). \nMeasurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. \nMerchant Services: offers merchants payment processing capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and other payments services.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. \n# \nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers."

It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven marketmaking activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified riskmanagement activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. \nPSU(s): Performance share units \nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. \nREO: Real estate owned \nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. \nRetained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e.   \nexcludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). \nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. \nThe Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 158 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting. \n# \nItem 1.
