In fact, tobacco exports account for only $4.5\\%$ of the total agri exports. Globally, cigarettes constitute nearly $90\\%$ of total tobacco consumption. Thereforeï¼Œ the export demand primarily comprises of flue-cured crop,prvidesustantillymntassinift export potentialand,most mortantly, is a souef ever-growing taxrevenues. \n\n# \nIndia is pacing towards realizing its role as the third largest economy in the world by 2016.By2025Indiawillbeabout $60\\%$ of theUSeconomy.Thetransformationof the world economy into a tri-polar economy will be complete by 2035. These projections along with a consistent delivery on GDP growth rate are fuelling imagination of the second largestpopulationgrouponearth. \nVirginia (FCV) of cigarette tobaccos. In India, traditional products such as bidis and chewing tobaccos enjoy a lion's share of $86\\%$ of the total tobacco consumptions. Consequently, the cultivation pattern is skewed and not geared to cater to international demand. \nIndian economy has attained robustness. National income statistics released by the Central Statistical Organisation for the year 2005-06 revealed the third consecutive year of good performance. $\\mathtt{G D P}$ grewby $8.4\\%,$ backed by strong growth in agriculture of $3.9\\%,$ industrial growth of $9\\%$ anda $110\\%$ growth inthe services sector.For thelast three years, annual growth in GDP averaged around $8\\%$ \nFCV tobacco yields much higher returns to the farmers than any other crop grown in the region. Lakhs of farmers and farm workers have been reaping benefits from FCV \"FCV tobacco cultivation has brought about revolutionary changes inthe socio-economic status of the people in the tobacco-growing areas of Andhra Pradesh.\" - Central Tobacco Research Institute \n\nThe economic growth, though well distributed, can be largely atributed to the growth in the services sector. The share of services sector to GDP has grown from $49\\%$ in 2000to $54\\%$ in 2006. The share of agriculture has receded from $28\\%$ in2000to $22\\%$ in 2006. The manufacturing sector has maintained its share with just a 0.8 percentage point increase in the last seven years. \ntobacco contrary to those who have attempted alternate crops like cotton, maize etc and havemiserably failed.A growth inFCV tobacco exports would incentivise farmers togrow better quality/varieties of tobacco.However, India's exports are being impeded by the lack of a strong domestic base, as two thirds of tobacco production continues to comprise of varieties that have virtually no export potential. In this context,itwouldbeappropriatetohighlightBrazil'sphenomenalexportperformance. In theearly $70\\mathsf{s},$ Brazil's leaf exports were at par with India.However, over the next three decades, their exports have leapfrogged and are now six times that of India. \n# \n# \n# \nWidening the tax base \nThe Indian Cigarette industry is heavily taxed and operates under draconian regulatory conditions. Cigarettes which account for only $14\\%$ of the total tobacco consumption,contribute over $90\\%$ (approx. Rs. 8000 crore) of the total excise revenue from tobacco. This is a result of inequitable taxation on Cigarettes which is 34 times higher than other tobacco products. The current regulatory and taxation framework on cigarettes, does not take into account the uniqueness of Indian tobacco industry which is extremely fragmented. In India, $86\\%$ tobacco consumption comprises of bidi and chewing tobacco, with over 60% consumers having dual-usage patterns i.e. they consume cigarettes and other forms of tobacco as well. Even a slight increase in price of cigarettes shifts the demand to cheaper and revenue inefficient forms of tobacco like bidi, cheaper cigarette (that evade excise duty) and chewing tobacco. \nThe Cigarette industry has once again been singled out and levied with an excise increaseof $5\\%.$ This increase comes on the back of a $10\\%$ increase in the cigarette excise in the last Budget. In addition, some states levy entry tax, octroi and other local levies. All these put an additional burden to already heavily taxed Cigarette industry, which has been struggling in highly challenging regulatory environment. Also, exclusion of beedis andchewing tobacco from this levy is inequitous and discriminatory; this not only defeats the social objective of tobacco control but also jeopardise revenue collection, farmers' earnings and export collection. \nCigarettes contribute over Rs.8000 crore in excise,which accounts for more than $85\\%$ of the total excise revenue generated by tobacco products. A comparison in the global per capita consumption scenario puts India as second lowest. These figures create a misleading picture because even as cigarette consumption has declined from $23\\%$ in $1971\\textrm{-}72$ to $14\\%,$ total tobacco consumption has gone up from 406 million kgs in $1981~-82\\$ to 500 million kgs in 2004 - 05. This decline has undoubtedly resulted in a potential revenuelossto the exchequer. \nThis can be attributed to the inequity in the Government's tobacco tax policies. Cigarette consumption in India is extremely price elastic, unlike tobacco consumption. Any increase in prices / taxes leads to a migration towards non-cigarette tobaccos. As a result, contrary to the Government's objective of tobacco control, tobacco consumption has been increasing. Thus, the high rates of taxes on cigarettes have neither translated in optimizing tax revenues nor been able to restrain overall consumption."

Such a policy will encourage transition from traditional forms of tobacco consumption to more contemporary forms,which use superior quality (FCV) tobaccos. \n\"India has extensive experience with the diffculties   \nassociated with high rates and pervasive tax avoidance ..Expanding the tax base, rather than increasing rates,   \nis hence the preferred strategy\". Dr. V. Kelkar, Report of the Task Force on Implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 \n\"Beedis... deliver more toxic products to the smoker than other smoked tobacco products.Thus, the burden of tobacco-related diseases in higher in this group. Increased taxes on cigarettes since the 1970's resulted in increased consumption of beedis.\" \nReport on Tobacco Control in India, commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare \nKeeping in mind India's unique and fragmented pattern of tobacco consumption, this can be achieved through widening the tax base by bringing a much larger proportion of the unorganised sector into the tax net and providing tax stability \n# \nCigarettes are amongst six industries that are under compulsory licensing. However, under the ID&R Act, 1951, units employing less than 50 workers with the aid of power, or 100 workers without the aid of power can be set up without obtaining a compulsory license, if permitted by the State authorities. \nExploiting a lacuna in the Act by showing less than 50 persons in direct employment, many smallunits are manufacturing cigarettes by obtaining State permission only. This contradicts Government policy of strict control/regulation on tobacco, creates unlicensed additionalcapacitywhere $50\\%$ of existing industry licensed capacity is unutilized. This also leads to suspected evasion of excise duty. \n# \nThe Government's strategy of providing stability in excise tax rate on cigarettes has proved to be extremely beneficial for the FCV tobacco farmers. The farm prices were extremely attractive, this year the average farm price is expected to rise further, the average price for the 2005-2006 Karnataka crop was Rs. 48.06, while the ongoing auctions in Andhra Pradesh have yielded an average of Rs. 46.91 per kg. The average farm prices for FCV Tobacco in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (Rs./Kg.) were Rs. 36.75 and Rs.40.34 in the year 2003-04 and 2004-05 respectively. \nThe benefits of these measures will ultimately accrue to the tobacco farming community, which will be entirely in consonance with the Government's CMP: â€œ\"..to enhance the welfare and well-being of farmers, farm labour and workers...and assure a secure future for their families in everyrespect.\" \n# \n# \nDuring the year under report almost all the major cigarette brands of the Company performed better compared to that in the previous year.The market share of the Companygrewto $12.1\\%$ compared to 11.8% last year. New line extensions under the names FSK Lights, Red & White Milds and Tipper Premium were launched. Also a new brand I gen was launched in the Premium segment. Inspite of the substantial increaseof $10\\%$ in excise duty in 2005 Budget no major changes were effected by the Company on its cigarette prices. \nDuring the year under review the Company achieved a higher cigarette sales volume of 12522 million cigarettes as against 11496 million cigarettes in the previous year givingitanincreasedsalesvolumeby $8.9\\%.$ Intermsofvaluethecigarettesaleswas higher at about Rs. 1324 crore as against Rs. 1180 crore in the previous year registering anincreaseof $12.2\\%.$ \nDuring the first quarter of the current financial year the domestic cigarette sales volume were higher at 3270 million cigarettes as against 3117 million cigaretes sold during the corresponding quarter last year registering an increase of $5\\%.$ In value terms the cigarette sales during the first quarter were higher by about $9.6\\%$ at Rs. 360.54 crore as against Rs. 328.96 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. \n\n# \nDuring the year under report the domestic tea sales were higher at $3050$ tonnes valued at Rs. 39 crore as against 2890 tonnes valued at Rs. 38 crore thereby registering an increaseof $6\\%$ in terms of quantity and $3\\%$ intermsof value. \nWith the process of integration of tea distribution with cigarettes distribution, youi Directors are confident of higher turnover of tea in the years ahead. \nDuring the first quarter of the current year the Company has been able to achieve sales of tea in the domestic market of Rs. 9.70 crore as compared to Rs. 7.96 crore during the corresponding quarter last year. \n# \nDuring the year, the aggregate value of exports including tobacco, cut tobacco, cigarettes and tea were lower at Rs.61.39 crore as against Rs. 73.26 crore in the previous year as exports of cigarettes and unmanufactured tobacco were lower though exports of tea were significantly higher. All efforts are being made to obtain substantial increase in exports of unmanufactured tobacco through establishing new contacts, appointment of agents for participation in tenders etc. and it is hoped that these efforts and initiatives shall bring in positive results in future. \n# \nDuring the year under report the Company was able to sell a higher quantity of cigars with a sale of about 14 lac pieces compared to 10 lac pieces in the previous year registering an increaseof about $40\\%.$ In terms of value also the sales income was higher at Rs. 2.29 crore as against Rs. 1.77 crore in the previous year achieving a growthofabout $29\\%.$ \nThe success story continues, and the progress towards realizing the visionÂ· ${\\mathfrak{a}}{\\mathfrak{T}}_{0}$ make Godfrey Phillips India the destination for Cigars in India\" \nConsumers have shown greater acceptance of the Cigars marketed by the Company. \nIn the Machine made segment, Phillies Blunt, Phillies Chocolate, Phillies Strawberry, Phillies Cognac, Phillies Sweet Little, Phillies Cheroot, Hav-A-Tampa Vanilla, Black Gold and Hav-A-Tampa Natural continue to grow. \nIn the Hand rolled segment of cigars, Don Diego, Santa Damiana and Flor De Copan registered a remarkable growth thereby achieving $25\\%$ share of thesegment volume. \nPark Plaza (Delhi NCR) opened the first Cigar Shop, carrying all brands of Altadis USA, both the hand rolled and machine made cigars. The consumers appreciated the initiative, and are frequent visitors to the shop. \nYour Company made further inroads, and its innovative humidors have added lot of value to the prestigious outlets. \nHaving succeeded in the domestic market, the Company also made its presence felt in Duty Free Shop, and the response is very encouraging. \n# \nThe Company has been following a conservative approach consistently in deploying its long term surplus liquidity and accordingly investing the same in debt oriented schemes of different reputed mutual funds. The underlying principle therefore is derived from the twin objective namely, capital preservation with a market driven competitive return. In past, such investment portfolio gave the Company handsome returns when the interest rates were declining.However, with interest rates hardening for last about two years the return on these investments has suffered a set back. Your directors are currently busy reviewing the situation and appropriate steps will be taken for reshuffling the portfolio as may be deemed prudent. Meanwhile, with a view to secure higher returns a substantial portion of additional surplus has been invested in Fixed Maturity Plans (Debt Schemes) and recently a smaller portion in equity schemes besides a few cases of switchovers therein. \nIn addition the temporary surplus funds are also invested in liquid/short term schemes of mutual funds so as to fruitfully deploy the same. Such investments are used for making monthly payments of excise duty in due course. \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nFINANCIAL RESULTS & 2005-2006 Rs.in lac & 2004-2005 Rs. in lac \\\\\nGross Profit Less: Depreciation & 10942.26 1837.20 & 11650.26 1655.28 \\\\\nProfit before taxation and exceptional items Add:Exceptional items (Refer Note 14 to accounts) & 9105.06 864.30 & 9994.98 \\\\\nProfit before taxation & 9969.36 & 9994.98 \\\\\nLess: Provision for Taxation - current -deferred tax & 1307.35 & 3973.00 \\\\\n- fringe benefit tax & 1984.30 664.75 & (337.87) \\\\\nProfit aftertaxforthe year & 6012.96 & 6359.85 \\\\\nProfitBroughtForward & 21064.27 & 18713.00 \\\\\n & 27077.23 & 25072.85 \\\\\nAppropriations \\\\\nProposed Dividend & 2339.72 & 2287.73 \\\\\nCorporateDividendTax & 328.15 & 320.85 \\\\\nTransferto General Reserve \\\\\n & 1400.00 & 1400.00 \\\\\nSurpluscarried toBalanceSheet & 23009.36 & 21064.27 \\\\\n & 27077.23 & 25072.85 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe overall sales turnover comprising of cigarettes, tobacco, cigar and tea was also higher at Rs. $1432$ crore as against Rs. 1296 crore in the previous year, registering an increaseofmorethan $10\\%.$ After providing for the taxation, the net profit of the Company was at Rs. 60.13 crore as against Rs. 63.60 crore in the previous year. \n# \nKeeping in view the Company's performance for the year under report the Board of Directors of the Company are pleased to recommend a higher dividend of Rs. 22.50 per share as against Rs. 22 per share paid for the previous year. \n# \nThe Supreme Court of India upheld the retrospective levy of excise duty that adversely affected certain cigarette manufacturers who had set up manufacturing facilities in Assam and supplied cigarettes to your company.

Other monetary items are translated at the year end rates and the gains/losses are taken to the relevant revenue heads in the profitandlossaccount. \nThe difference between the forwardrate and the exchange rate at the date of the forward contract transaction is recognised as income or expense over the life of the contract in the profit and loss account. The exchange difference on such contracts i.e. difference between the exchange rate at the reporting /settlement date and the exchange rate on the date of inception of the contract/the last reporting date, is recognised as income or expense for the period except where the foreign exchange liabilities have been incurred in connection with fixed assets acquired upto March 31, 2004 and subsequent thereto in case of fixed assets acquired from a country outside India, where the exchange differences are adjusted in the carrying amount of concerned fixed assets."
