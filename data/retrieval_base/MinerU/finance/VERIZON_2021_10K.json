On November 23, 2021, we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), a provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. Additional information is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. \nIn 2021, the Consumer segment’s revenues were $\\$95.3$ billion, representing approximately $71\\%$ of Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2021, Consumer had approximately 115 million wireless retail connections, approximately 7 million wireline broadband connections, which includes Fios and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) internet connections, and approximately 4 million Fios video connections. \n# \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. \nIn 2021, the Business segment's revenues were $\\$31.0$ billion, representing approximately $23\\%$ of Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2021, Business had approximately 27 million wireless retail postpaid connections and approximately 477 thousand wireline broadband connections, which includes Fios and DSL internet connections. \nAdditional discussion of our reportable segments is included in Item 7. under the headings \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\" and - \"Segment Results of Operations\" and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. \n# \nOur Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. \n# \nWe offer wireless services and equipment to both Consumer customers and Business customers. \n# \nOur Consumer and Business segments provide a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers that are directly served and managed by Verizon and use Verizon branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 million prepaid connections, which include approximately 20 million Consumer prepaid connections due to the Tracfone acquisition. Approximately $79\\%$ of our Consumer wireless retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2021."

In addition, our customers can access the internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. \nWe no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. \n# \nConsumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. We permit customers to acquire equipment from us using device payment plans, which permit the customer to pay for the device in installments over time. \n# \nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. Consumer also provides non-connectivity services including device protection, cloud storage, and other products. \nResidential Fixed Services. We provide residential fixed connectivity solutions to customers over our $100\\%$ fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio, and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. As of December 31, 2021, fifth-generation (5G) fixed wireless technology for the home (5G Home) is available in parts of $65\\mathrm{~U~}.5$ . cities. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Home fixed wireless access internet service is available in parts of all 50 states across the United States. \nWe offer residential fixed services tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our services may include features related to, among other things: internet access at different speed tiers using fiber-optic, copper or wireless technology; video services that may feature a variety of channel options, video on demand products, cloud-based services and digital video recording capabilities; over-the-top video services; voice services; and other home solutions. \nNetwork Access Services. We sell network access to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on a wholesale basis, who in turn resell wireless service under their own brand(s) to consumers. Our largest such arrangement was with Tracfone, until we acquired Tracfone from América Móvil in November 2021. \n# \nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long-distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. \n# \nSmall and Medium Business offers wireless services and equipment, conferencing services, tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, advanced voice solutions and security and managed information technology (IT) services to our U.S.-based small and medium businesses that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise, as described below. In 2021, Small and Medium Business revenues were $\\$11.8$ billion, representing approximately $38\\%$ of Business’s total revenues. \nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Small and Medium Business provides fixed connectivity solutions comparable to the residential fixed services provided by Consumer, as well as business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case with features and pricing designed to address the needs of small and medium businesses."

        "text": "# \nGlobal Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector customers. In 2021, Global Enterprise revenues were $\\$10.2$ billion, representing approximately $33\\%$ of Business’s total revenues. \nlobal Enterprise offers a broad portfolio of connectivity, security and professional services designed to enable our customers to optimize heir business operations, mitigate business risks and capitalize on data. These services include the following: \nNetwork Services. We offer a portfolio of network connectivity products to help our customers connect with their employees, partners, vendors and customers. These products include private networking services, private cloud connectivity services, virtual and software defined networking services and internet access services.   \nAdvanced Communications Services. We offer a suite of services to our customers to help them communicate with their employees, partners, vendors, constituents and customers. These products include IP-based voice and video services, unified communications and collaboration tools and customer contact center solutions.   \nSecurity services. We offer a suite of management and data security services that help our customers protect, detect and respond to security threats to their networks, data, applications and infrastructure.   \nCore services. We provide a portfolio of domestic and global voice and data solutions utilizing traditional telecommunications technology, including voice calling, messaging services, conferencing, contact center solutions and private line and data access networks. Core services also include the provision of customer premises equipment, and installation, maintenance and site services. IoT services. We provide the network access required to deliver various IoT products and services. We work with companies that purchase network access from us to connect their devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end users. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. \n# \nPublic Sector and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. federal, state and local governments and educational institutions. These services include business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with features and pricing designed to address the needs of governments and educational institutions. In 2021, Public Sector and Other revenues were \\$6.3 billion, representing approximately $20\\%$ of Business’s total revenues. \nPublic Sector and Other also includes solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, asset tracking and other types of mobile resource management in the U.S. and around the world. \n# \nWholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2021, Wholesale revenues were $\\$2.7$ billion, representing approximately $9\\%$ of Business’s total revenues. A portion of Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Wholesale's services include: \nData services. We offer a portfolio of data services to enhance our Wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers.   \nVoice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. In addition, we provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the U.S. and globally utilizing our time-division multiplexing and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks.   \nLocal services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. \n# \nWe use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services to Consumer and Business customers. \nOur direct channel, including our company-operated stores, is a core component of our distribution strategy. Our sales and service centers and business direct sales teams also represent significant distribution channels for our services. In addition, we have a robust digital channel and omni-channel experience for our customers in order to offer choice and convenience."

        "page_idx": 6,
        "text": "Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with highprofile national retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services, as well as convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products and services. \nIn addition to our direct channel, our Business segment has additional distribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided by resellers, non-stocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services provided by system integrators and resellers. \n# \nThe telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share. \nWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies and others. Competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, including 5G, the introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional bundled premium content, increased levels of promotions and service plan discounts, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and regulatory changes. In addition, increasing government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of certain of our competitors to compete with us. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication services. In addition, DISH Network has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network in each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 2023, which could result in additional competitive pressures in the U.S. wireless industry. \nWe also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies. \nWith respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top (OTT) providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. Several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Traditional wireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services while increasing their broadband internet footprint. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from various online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers. \nWe believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry: \nNetwork reliability, speed and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage.   \nPricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers. Pricing also plays an important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge, new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents using competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues."

        "text": "Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. \nCustomer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business customers through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives. \nProduct differentiation. Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services, as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband, video and wireless connections. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services, both independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers and device manufacturers. Features such as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. \nSales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution channels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, outside sales teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end-users. \nIn addition to these competitive factors and trends, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. \nIn the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumer-like \"look and feel\" are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. \nIn the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software defined networking, communication applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house machines. \nOur Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity. \n# \nOur global network architecture is used by Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies. \n# \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-efficient manner. \n# \nOver the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current fourthgeneration (4G) LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. As of December 31, 2021, 5G Ultra Wideband is available in parts of 87 U.S. cities and 5G Home is available in parts of 65 U.S. cities. Our FWA broadband service continued to grow during the year with a customer base of approximately 223 thousand as of December 31, 2021. In January 2022, we successfully deployed C-Band spectrum, reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S. as of February 2022."

        "text": "5G Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, which allows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s high-band Ultra Wideband coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5G Nationwide network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and 5G customers. \n# \nThe wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technology. As of December 31, 2021, our 4G LTE network covers approximately 328 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier’s network assets with our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. LTE Home Internet, our home broadband internet service, leverages the Verizon 4G LTE network. \n# \nWe consider the reliability, coverage and speed of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services. As we design and deploy our network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables, delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network: increasing the density of our network elements, deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service. \nWe have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates. \nIn order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must secure rights to a large number of sites and obtain zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites. \nOur networks in the U.S. include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations. \nIn addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the U.S. \n# \nResidential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. We expect the continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. \nWhile deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. \n# \nVerizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business customers in more than 180 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that enable and support international operations. \nGlobal business is rapidly evolving to an \"everything-as-a-service\" model in which Business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. We are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand."

        "text": "# \nThe spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the $800\\mathrm{MHz}$ band, also known as cellular spectrum, the $1800{-}1900~\\mathrm{MHz}$ band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the $700~\\mathrm{MHz}$ upper CBand and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and $2100\\mathrm{MHz}$ bands, in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. We have also deployed 4G technologies in 3.5 Gigahertz (GHz) shared spectrum, using LTE/Citizens Broadband Radio Service, and in $5\\mathrm{GHz}$ unlicensed spectrum, using LTE/Licensed Assisted Access. All of this spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. We are using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide 3G, 4G LTE and 5G wireless services. We are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE service. We are also utilizing low and mid-band spectrum through DSS for 5G to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ band, collectively called millimeter wave spectrum. In 2021, we acquired an average of $161~\\mathrm{MHz}$ of new mid-band spectrum in the continental United States in the 3700-3980 MHz band, also known as C-Band. We began using C-Band for 5G service in January 2022. \nMillimeter wave spectrum is being used in conjunction with low and mid-band spectrum for our 5G technology deployment. We own millimeter wave spectrum predominantly in the 28 GHz and 37/39 GHz bands. Millimeter wave spectrum is currently being used to increase capacity for mobile and fixed wireless services in areas of high demand. We anticipate that demand will continue to increase over time, driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. \nFrom time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals. \nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. \n# \nAt Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets. In order to realize our core business strategy, we have developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees from the time they join our team through the entirety of their careers with Verizon. These programs are centered on the following principles: \nAttract the right talent for our future and maintain a diverse workforce with high-value skills and expertise.   \nDevelop our employees to their full potential through best-in-class educational programs and exceptional development experiences and create a culture of continuous learning and engagement.   \nInspire individuals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work and upskilling opportunities and establishing an inclusive work environment for all. \nVerizon is committed to being an employer of choice. With approximately 118,400 employees, including approximately 800 Tracfone employees, on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 31, 2021, $89\\%$ of whom are based in the U.S., we know that we need employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to help us understand and connect more meaningfully to the diverse customers and communities we serve. Our human capital programs and practices are designed to create a workplace where employees are empowered to share their authentic selves and feel seen and heard as vital contributors to Verizon’s corporate purpose. In addition, Verizon has extensive on-the-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development support to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally. Guided by our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, our hiring and outreach programs have resulted in a strong representation of women and people of color. As of December 31, 2021, Verizon's global workforce was approximately $66.9\\%$ male and $33.1\\%$ female, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was $53.9\\%$ White, $20.1\\%$ Black, $11.9\\%$ Hispanic, $8.0\\%$ Asian, $0.4\\%$ American Indian/Alaskan Native, $0.3\\%$ Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, $2.6\\%$ two or more races, and $2.8\\%$ unknown or undeclared. Women represented $38.7\\%$ of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color represented $34.9\\%$ of U.S. senior leadership."

        "text": "Verizon respects our employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable law, including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers—the two unions that in total represent approximately $24.0\\%$ of our employees as of December 31, 2021. The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union- represented employees who serve customers in our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast service areas extend through August 5, 2023. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety, customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy. \nFor a discussion of the oversight provided by the Verizon Board of Directors over the Company’s human capital management practices, see the section entitled \"Governance — Our Approach to Governance — Our Approach to Strategy and Risk Oversight — Oversight of Human Capital Management\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in connection with our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. \n# \nWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of Verizon's brands and the results of Verizon’s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. \nWe periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease offering the relevant products or services. \n# \n# \nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. \n# \n# \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. \nThe Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of wireless service. For example, some states impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process."

        "text": "# \nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as \"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. However, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, a number of states have taken steps to attempt to regulate broadband and two of those cases related to regulations in California and Vermont are being litigated in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. Our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadbandcommitment. \n# \nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. \n# \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \n# \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the artificial intelligence and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product or service. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020, both include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other states and countries have continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. \n# \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters; for example, the California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities. \n# \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. \n# \nSince the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state and local policies, regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the world’s population. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including telecommunications companies, can operate their business and interact with their customers. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact of the crisis and the governmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict."

This information should be read in conjunction with \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. \n# \n# \nCyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks, ransomware attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. \nThe inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to our competitors. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Our presence in the IoT industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s results of operation or financial condition. \n# \nOur business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, terrorist or other hostile acts, natural disasters or the potential impacts of climate change, including the increasing prevalence and intensity of hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail and storms. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits. \n# \nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an adverse effect on our operating results in 2020. Our business is based on our ability to provide products and services to customers throughout the United States and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their businesses and in their daily lives. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic, that significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products and services, the way our employees are able to provide services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to provide products and services to us. For example, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and initiatives Verizon took in response to the health crisis to promote the health and safety of our employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers, along with the related global slowdown in economic activity, resulted in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020. In addition, such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances, such as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships, risks of an economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs and availability of financing. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations depends on many factors, including those discussed above, that are not within our control."

        "text": "# \nWe depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of geopolitical factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters or the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nThe suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. \n# \nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $24.0\\%$ of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is represented by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our operations. \n# \n# \nWe face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, technology companies and application and device providers. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits."

In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. If our new services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. \nIn addition, the deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment and spectrum availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. These issues could result in significant costs, put us at a competitive disadvantage, or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks. \nAs we introduce new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.

In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. \n# \nUnfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, or inflation in the markets in which we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and our cost of doing business. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n# \n# \nOur domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nNew laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state, and local, or international level, such as those described below, those that incentivize business models or technologies different from ours or requirements limiting our ability to discontinue service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. \nPrivacy and data protection - We are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020, both include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other states and countries have continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. Regulation of broadband internet access services - In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding \"light touch\" approach to regulating broadband internet access services and \"reclassified\" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the D.C. Circuit but may be revisited by the FCC or by Congress. Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that"

        "text": "would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC’s 2015 rules).   \nAlthough some of these have been challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. \n\"Open Access\" - We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. Climate-Related Regulation and Policy – Due to the nature of our operations, we may be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels. \nThese developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. \n# \nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. \n\nVerizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. \nAs of December 31, 2021, Verizon had approximately $\\$136.7$ billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $\\$9.4$ billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and $\\$14.2$ billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. Verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: \nrequiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions; making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions; • making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates. \n# \nWe require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. \n# \nWith approximately 118,400 employees, including approximately 800 Tracfone employees, and approximately 187,000 retirees as of December 31, 2021 eligible to participate in Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments."

        "text": "# \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). \n# \n\n# \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our $100\\%$ fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. \nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. On November 23, 2021, we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), a provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. Additional information is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. \nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. The Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $\\$95.3$ billion, an increase of $\\$6.8$ billion, or $7.6\\%$ , compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics. \n# \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products, including solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, asset tracking and other types of mobile resource management. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. The Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $\\$31.0$ billion, an increase of $\\$80$ million, or $0.3\\%$ , compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

        "text": "On May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media to the affiliate. The transaction closed on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under our ownership, Verizon Media's total operating revenues were $\\$5.3$ billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n# \nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, these investments included $\\$20.3$ billion for capital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $\\mathbb{S}2.1$ billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy. \n# \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also building our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. As of December 31, 2021, 5G Ultra Wideband is available in parts of 87 U.S. cities and 5G Home is available in parts of 65 U.S. cities. 5G Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, which allows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s high-band Ultra Wideband coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5G Nationwide network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-efficient manner. \n# \nThe impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations were significant during 2020, which affects the comparability of the results from 2021 to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain, including the recent surge of new virus variants across the U.S. We remain committed to caring for the health and safety of our employees and our customers through this challenge while supporting the communities in which we operate. While we have not experienced a material impact on our business from these new variants thus far, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations in the future, and will continue to monitor their daily evolution. For a discussion of the risks to our business from COVID-19, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors. \n# \nIn January 2022, we successfully deployed C-Band spectrum, reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S. as of February 2022. \n# \nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment results. In \"Segment Results of Operations,\" we review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail. A detailed discussion of 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020."

It is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding. \n(3) We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management. \ntal interest expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: \nan increase in capitalized interest costs as a result of qualifying activities performed on C-Band licenses won; and an increase in interest costs on debt balances as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates as a result of our continuing focus on optimizing our debt footprint and total borrowing costs. \nSee Note 4 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on spectrum licenses and debt transactions, respectively. \nProvision for Income Taxes ,(dollars in millions) Increase/(Decrease) \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\nYearsEndedDecember31. & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{2021} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{2020 2021vs.2020} \\\\\nProvision for income taxes & 6,802 $ & 5,619 $ & 1,183 & 21.1 % \\\\\nEffectiveincometaxrate & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{23.1 % 23.4 %} \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in the current period, partially offset by the nonrecurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a series of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in the current period. \nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. \n# \nConsolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses to net income. \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See \"Special Items\" for additional information. \nIt is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies."

We measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. \nTo aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our segments. We believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments’ operating results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies. \nWireless retail connections are retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections as of the end of the period.

Wireless retail postpaid service revenue does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, plan billings related to device warranty and insurance or regulatory fees. Wireless retail postpaid ARPA in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail postpaid service revenue by the average retail postpaid accounts in the period. \nWireless retail postpaid accounts are wireless retail customers that are directly served and managed under the Verizon brand and use its services as of the end of the period. Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single connection plans and multi-connection family plans.

        "text": "We will continue to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while building momentum for our 5G network. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network that enable efficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements. \nThe U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry. We expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. We expect 5G technology will provide a significant opportunity for growth in the industry in 2022 and beyond. With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies and others. We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. \nWith respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. These service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers. \nWe expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher access plans, driven in part by attractive bundled content with premium brands, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. \nCurrent and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. \nIn addition, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. \nDespite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services. We continue to provide network reliability and offer products, which include fiber-optic internet access, several video services, and voice services. Further, we will continue to offer our business and government customers more robust IP products and services, and advance our IoT strategies by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. \nWe will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to ensure we have the maximum flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and economic environments and maximize returns to shareholders. \n# \nIn our Consumer segment, we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain high-quality retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data services and providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and other connected devices such as wearables. We believe the combination of our wireless network performance and Mix & Match unlimited plans provides a superior customer experience, supporting increased penetration of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher valued retail postpaid connections. We anticipate continued pressure in 2022 related to Tracfone subscribers as we seek to improve the customer retention rate that has declined over the prior two years, however expect to grow the Tracfone customer base over time by furthering our investment and increasing our product and service offerings within the business. We expect to manage churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless service and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and continued focus in our distribution channels. We expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas, further supported by the demand for higher speed internet connections. At the same time, we expect accelerating fixed wireless access connections to complement strong Fios results as demand for services continues to grow. In Fios video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We expect to manage market pressure by offering customers a choice of video service, including options such as Mix & Match on Fios and other offerings. We have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and switched to alternative technologies such as wireless, Voice over Internet Protocol, and cable for voice and data services."

        "text": "In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the U.S. We continue to grow our retail connections while operating in a competitive environment. We expect that this connection growth, combined with our industryleading network assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions, such as those around security, advanced communications and professional services. We also expect to expand our existing services offered to business customers through our Intelligent Edge Network, our multi-use platform. \nIn addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth in part by adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network, and by leading the build-out of our 5G network. We also anticipate the continued migration of 3G connections onto 4G and 5G technologies with the expected cessation of 3G services. \n# \nIn our Consumer segment, we expect to see a continuation of service revenue growth in 2022 as customers shift to higher access plans with additional services and increase the number of devices they connect with our networks and services. We expect continued growth in wireless service revenue, driven by Tracfone contributions, migrations to higher priced plans and increases in fixed wireless access connections. We expect Fios revenue to benefit in 2022 as growth in our broadband customer base and increases in demand for higher speed internet connections offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to standalone service. \nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by growth from increases in wireless volumes and fixed wireless access contributions. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth. Legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures. \nOn September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. We expect to see a decrease in operating revenues as a result of this divestiture. \n# \nWe expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to drive revenue growth and undertake initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business in 2022 and beyond. Business Excellence initiatives include zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks and evolving our Information Technology strategy. We believe our additional investments in our Business segment in both product simplification and continued focus on process improvements and new work tools will drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G and One Fiber. \nWe create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders. Verizon’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly dividend by $2.0\\%$ during 2021, making this the fifteenth consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend. \nOur goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business, strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see \"Cash Flows from Investing Activities\"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock (see \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\"). \n# \nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our networks, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses and spectrum and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. \nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $\\$2.9$ billion as of December 31, 2021, consistent with historical pre-pandemic levels. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity. See \"Market Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies. \nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, such as the completion of business acquisitions, the acquisition of additional wireless spectrum, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital market securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through asset-backed debt transactions."

We expect that the new network architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2022 capital program to be between $\\$16.5$ billion and $\\$123$ billion. Furthermore, we expect an additional $\\$5.0$ billion to $\\$6.0$ billion in capital expenditures related to C-Band, as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations for deploying phase two spectrum. \n# \nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021: \nLong-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of \\$150.2 billion and related interest payments of $\\$78.0$ billion, of which $\\$7.1$ billion and $\\$4.9$ billion, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months.

In addition, the Company has an obligation of $\\$969$ million representing future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, of which $\\$292$ million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.   \nUnconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $\\$23,8$ billion, of which $\\$10.2$ billion is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in unconditional purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.   \nOther long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $\\$4.2$ billion, of which \\$864 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Qualified pension plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2031, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit payments include estimated future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which could impact the timing and/or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $\\$3.1$ billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities until the related tax audits are further developed or resolved.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $\\$2.2$ billion during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to changes in working capital, which includes higher wireless volumes, and slightly higher cash taxes in 2021. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings of \\$4.3 billion. As a result of prior years' discretionary contributions and the fact that actual asset returns have been higher than expected, we expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2031, subject to changes in market conditions. \n# \n# \nCapital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges."

Two loan agreements are outstanding in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing Facility, one with a final maturity date in December 2025 and the other in December 2026, and each loan agreement bears interest at floating rates. There is a one or two year revolving period, as set forth in the applicable loan agreement, which may be extended with the approval of the financial institutions. Under the loan agreements, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty, but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity. In December 2021, we borrowed \\$4.3 billion under the loan agreements.

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. \nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: \n(dollars in millions) \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nYearsEndedDecember31, &  & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nNet cash provided by operating activities &  & 39,539 S & 41,768 \\\\\nLess Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) &  & 20,286 & 18,192 \\\\\nFreecashflow & S & 19,253 S & 23,576 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe decrease in free cash flow during 2021 is a reflection of the decrease in operating cash flows, as well as the increase in capital expenditures discussed above. \n# \n# \nWe operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2021 or 2020. During 2021 and 2020 we made contributions of $\\$58$ million and $\\$57$ million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. \nThe Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however, we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $\\$60$ million in 2022."

Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units. \n# \nThe carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $\\$147.6$ billion as of December 31, 2021. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment according to the policy. \nOur quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly, our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate."

        "text": "The quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a $10\\%$ decline in the fair value of our wireless licenses, the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant estimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis points (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed its carrying value. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors. Our annual impairment tests in 2020 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \n# \nTo determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit being assessed. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every three years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed quantitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units according to the policy. \nUnder the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors. \nUnder our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. \nA projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) more than anticipated increase in promotional activity, decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases to longterm interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. \nAt December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $\\$28.6$ billion, of which $\\$21.0$ billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $\\$7.5$ billion was in our Business reporting unit. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2021, our quantitative assessments indicate that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment. In the event of a $10\\%$ decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units, the fair value of each of our reporting units would have still exceeded their book values. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to change the outcomes to these quantitative impairment assessments. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps, or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair values of our reporting units would still exceed their respective carrying values. \nAt December 31, 2020, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $\\$24.8$ billion, of which $\\$12$ billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $\\$7.5$ billion was in our Business reporting unit. We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2020. Our qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an impairment."

        "text": "# \nWe maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. \nIn determining pension and other postretirement obligations, the weighted-average discount rate was selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2021. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $\\$300$ million par outstanding). Bond yields are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit rating downgrades and upgrades, government fiscal policy decisions, and general market volatility. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in determining the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations are based on expectations for future investment returns for the plans’ asset allocation. The rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit ratings, monetary policy, inflation, exchange rates, investor behavior and general market volatility. \nA sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2021 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is provided in the table below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(dollars in millions) & Percentagepoint change & Increase/(decrease)at December31,2021 \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Pension plans discount rate} & +0.50 & (1,125) \\\\\n & -0.50 & 1,249 \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Rate of return on pension plan assets} & +1.00 & (189) \\\\\n & -1.00 & 189 \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Postretirementplansdiscountrate} & +0.50 & (810) \\\\\n & -0.50 & 896 \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Rate of return on postretirementplan assets} & +1.00 & (5) \\\\\n & -1.00 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost. \nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n# \nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n# \nOur Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property, plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate Property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimated useful life is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or performance, technical obsolescence, market expectations and competition impacts. In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment during 2021, we determined that the estimated useful life of our Property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2021 depreciation expense of $\\$2.2$ billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately $\\$3.5$ billion in our 2021 depreciation expense."

        "text": "# \nPrior to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. However, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future, if applicable. The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics. \nWe record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The weighted-average expected loss rate decreased $0.81\\%$ at December 31, 2021 as compared to at December 31, 2020. We expect that an increase or decrease of $0.25\\%$ in the weighted-average loss rate would result in a change of $\\$94$ million in the allowance. \nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. \nIf there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n# \n# \nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. \nIn March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ , and $47\\mathrm{GHz}$ bands concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ licenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $\\$3.4$ billion, of which $\\$1.8$ billion was settled with the relinquished $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ licenses. The new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and are included in Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets. \nIn September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. Verizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder on 557 licenses in the $3.5\\mathrm{GHz}$ band valued at approximately $\\$1.9$ billion. Verizon made payments for these licenses in 2020 and received them from the FCC in March 2021. The purchase cost for these licenses and related capitalized interest, based on qualifying activities that occurred, are included in Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets. \nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon was the winning bidder on 3,511 licenses, consisting of contiguous C-Band spectrum bands ranging between 140 and 200 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in all 406 markets available in the auction. Verizon paid $\\$45.5$ billion for the licenses it won, of which $\\$44.6$ billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021.

In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 will consist of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses. Carrying value will also include capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred. The licenses were received from the FCC in July 2021 and are included within Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. \nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our spectrum license transactions. \n# \nIn September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (Tracfone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date). In accordance with the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of Tracfone's outstanding stock in exchange for approximately $\\$3.5$ billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, subject to customary adjustments, 57,596,544 shares of Verizon common stock valued at approximately $\\$3.0$ billion, and up to an additional $\\$650$ million in future cash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of the Verizon common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $\\$542$ million calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and significant unobservable inputs, thus representing a Level 3 measurement. The contingent consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn out period, as defined in the Tracfone Purchase Agreement. Payments related to the contingent consideration are expected to begin in 2022 and continue through 2024. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n# \nIn October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass, a rural wireless operator serving central Kentucky. Bluegrass provides wireless service to 210,000 customers in 34 counties in rural service areas 3, 4, and 5 in Central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $\\$412$ million, net of cash acquired, which is subject to customary closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n# \nIn April 2020, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire BlueJeans, an enterprise-grade video conferencing and event platform, whose services are sold to Business customers globally. The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $\\$397$ million, net of cash acquired. \n# \nOn May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media in return for consideration of $\\$4.3$ billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments, $\\$750$ million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and $10\\%$ of the fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate. \nOn September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value of the nonconvertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and the fair value of $10\\%$ of the fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $\\$4.3$ billion, \\$496 million, and $\\$124$ million, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $\\$1.0$ billion (after-tax $\\$1.0$ billion) in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $\\$346$ million of various costs associated with this disposition which are primarily recorded in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n# \nFrom time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nIn December 2021, we completed the sale of our investment in the Complex Media business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $\\$131$ million in Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. \nIn November 2020, Verizon entered into an agreement to sell our Huffington Post business.

        "text": "We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. \nIt is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. \nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2021, we held and posted $\\$0.1$ billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, we held $\\$0.2$ billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio. \n# \nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $81\\%$ of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $\\$28$ million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings. \nCertain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent U.S. and international regulatory guidance for reform. The one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates ceased publication after December 31, 2021, and other U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will cease publication after June 30, 2023. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt, taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging. The floating rate senior unsecured notes issued in March 2021 and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the benchmark rate. \nThe table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. \n(dollars in millions) \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nLong-term debtandrelatedderivatives & FairValue & FairValue assuming + 100 basis point shift & FairValue assuming - 100 basis point shift \\\\\nAtDecember31,2021 & 169,179 & 156,078 & 184,496 \\\\\nAtDecember31,2020 & 155,695 & 142,420 & 170,423 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nWe enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt.

        "text": "Description of the Matter \n# \nThe Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $\\$20.2$ billion and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $\\$20.1$ billion, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $\\$0.1$ billion. Also, at December 31, 2021, the other postretirement benefits obligation was approximately $\\$14.7$ billion. As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to measure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \nAuditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and mortality rates) used in the measurement process. These assumptions had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the employee benefits obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the employee benefit obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuary. \nTo test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management’s actuarial specialists. \n# \n# \nWe have served as Verizon's auditor since 2000.

        "text": "# \nVerizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our $100\\%$ fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. \n# \nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \n# \nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. \n# \nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from COVID-19 pandemic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of the impacts from COVID-19 remain unclear, the Company’s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. \n# \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and government customers. We account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (Topic 606)."

        "text": "We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. \n# \n# \n# \nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. \n# \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a 24 or 30-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned. \nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixedterm and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. \n# \nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures. \nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The guarantee liability was $\\$77$ million and insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract."

        "text": "Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed. \nFor our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability. \nWe may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. \n# \nTotal consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of transaction price and related disclosures. \nWe may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Business customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. \n# \nFor offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent with respect to the goods or services provided to the customer. This principal-versus-agent assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or services were controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer. To evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing. \n# \nAdvertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. The divested Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), primarily earned revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising, and subscription arrangements. Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered, while subscription contracts are recognized over time. We are generally the principal in transactions carried out through our advertising platforms, and therefore report gross revenue based on the amount billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, where our proprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory that we then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing. We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. \nWe offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization software. Telematics service revenue is generated primarily through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts. \nWe report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis. \n# \nWe charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred. \n# \nCosts for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred. See Note 15 for additional information. \n# \nBasic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans."

        "text": "There were a total of approximately 2 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. \n# \nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds. \nCash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables collateralizing asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the consolidated balance sheets: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\nAtDecember31, &  & 2021 & 2020 &  & Increase (Decrease) \\\\\nCashandcashequivalents & S & 2,921 & S & 22,171 S & (19,250) \\\\\nRestricted cash: \\\\\nPrepaid expenses and other &  & 1,094 &  & 1,195 & (101) \\\\\nOtherassets &  & 146 &  & 132 & 14 \\\\\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash &  & 4,161 & S & 23,498 & (19,337) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nInvestments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permitted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nPrior to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. However, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future, if applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics. \nWe pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk characteristics of \"new customers\" and \"existing customers.\" New customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210 days. Existing customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for 210 days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. \nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above."

Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis. \nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset was placed in service. \nWhen depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the property, plant and equipment accounts and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense. \nWe capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property, plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets. \n# \nWe capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that have a useful life and term in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use network and nonnetwork software are capitalized only to the extent that they add significant new functionality. Planning, software maintenance and training costs for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We capitalize interest associated with the development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 5 to 7 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred in implementing a cloud computing arrangement are deferred during the application-development stage and recorded as Prepaid expense and Other in our consolidated balance sheets. Once a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we stop deferring the related cloud computing arrangement costs. \nFor a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized software costs, see \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" below. Also, see Note 4 for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to capitalized software costs, deferred costs associated with cloud computing arrangements are subject to impairment testing. \n# \n# \nGoodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. \nTo determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. \nUnder the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors. \nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach) to its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see \"Fair Value Measurements\" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. \nSee Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing."

        "text": "# \nA significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. \nAs part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests. \nOur quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized. \nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use. \nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Deposits for wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. \n# \nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives. \nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets. \n# \nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately, we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use. \nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis."

        "text": "In those circumstances where the Company is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our asset classes. Additionally, in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements. \nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is being paid. Variable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments dependent on various external indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage. \nOperating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets; we recognize rent expense for these eases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nWe recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income. The interest expense related to finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. \nSee Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). \n# \nFair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows: \nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   \nLevel 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   \nLevel 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy. \n# \nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. \nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. \nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability. \nSignificant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate. \n# \nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 10 for additional information. \n# \nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates"

Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets.

We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE."

Revenue is disaggregated by products and services within Consumer, and customer groups (Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale) within Business. See Note 13 for additional information on revenue by segment. \nCorporate and other primarily includes insurance captives as well as the historical results of the divested Verizon Media.

Below we disclose information relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606 that provides the option to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatisfied performance obligations related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This situation primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service contracts. At December 31, 2021, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately $93\\%$ of our wireless postpaid contracts and $86\\%$ of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts, compared to December 31, 2020, for which month-to-month service contracts represented approximately $90\\%$ of our wireless postpaid contracts and $75\\%$ of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts. \nAdditionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to these additional services are ecognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nContracts for wireless services, with or without promotional credits that require maintenance of service, are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time (typically under a device payment plan) or considered to contain terms ranging from greater than one month to up to thirty months (typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional services purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month contracts. \nOur Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service under their own brands to their respective customers. Reseller arrangements generally include a stated contract term, which typically extends longer than two years and, in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract term for which revenues will be recognized in future periods. \nConsumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however, they may have a service term of two years or shorter than twelve months. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services extend into future periods, contain fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees, and can include annual commitments in each year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract term; however, a significant number of contracts for wireline services with our Business customers have a contract term that is twelve months or less. \nAdditionally, there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline and telematics services that have a contractual minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to those contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time bands below. These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately nine years ending in August 2031 and have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling $\\$2.4$ billion. \nAt December 31, 2021, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations for total Verizon that is expected to be recognized for 2022, 2023 and thereafter was $\\$123$ billion, $\\$8.3$ billion and $\\$2.3$ billion, respectively. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from contract modifications. \n# \nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance sheets represent an unconditional right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer, or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract. \nThe following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n(dollars in millions) & AtDecember31. 2021 & AtDecember31. 2020 & AtJanuary1, 2020 \\\\\nReceivables(l) & 10,758 & 12,029 & 12,078 \\\\\nDevice payment plan agreement receivables(2) & 12,888 & 10,358 & 11,741 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following contracts: leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a devic payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.   \n(2) Included in device payment plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8.

Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue is allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues. In conjunction with these arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration received from the customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability. \nContract assets remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2021. Contract assets decreased $\\$213$ million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to reclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings on existing contracts and impairment charges of $\\$75$ million, partially offset by new contracts driven by customer activity related to wireless. \nContract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill service one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities. \nContract liabilities increased $\\$1.6$ billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time and upfront fees, increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, as well as the acquisition of Tracfone, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to wireless and Fios services, as well as the sale of Verizon Media. Contract liabilities increased $\\$291$ million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time and upfront fees, as well as increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to wireless and Fios services. \nRevenue recognized during both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to contract liabilities existing at January 1, 2021 and 2020 were $\\$4.3$ billion, respectively, as performance obligations related to services were satisfied. \nThe balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{(dollars in millions)} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{AtDecember31,} & AtDecember31. \\\\\n &  & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nAssets \\\\\nPrepaid expenses and other & $ & 739 $ & 733 \\\\\nOtherassets &  & 195 & 204 \\\\\nTotal & $ & 934 $ & 937 \\\\\n \\\\\nLiabilities \\\\\nOthercurrentliabilities & $ & 6,053 $ & 4,843 \\\\\nOtherliabilities &  & 1,176 & 755 \\\\\nTotal & $ & 7,229 $ & 5,598 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nAs discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense over the respective periods of expected benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred absent the customer contract and are expected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense."

These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits. \nWe determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract portfolios. \nOther costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred. \nCollectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over a two-to sixyear period. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively. \nThe balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(dollars in millions) & AtDecember31, 2021 & AtDecember31, 2020 \\\\\nAssets \\\\\nPrepaid expenses and other & S 2,432 S & 2,472 \\\\\nOtherassets & 2,259 & 2,070 \\\\\nTotal & $ 4,691 & 4,542 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized expense of $\\$3.0$ billion and $\\$3.1$ billion, respectively, associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. \nWe assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n# \n# \nIn March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ , and $47\\mathrm{GHz}$ bands concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of $37\\mathrm{GHz}$ and, to a lesser extent, $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our $39\\mathrm{GHz}$ licenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $\\$3.4$ billion, of which $\\$1.8$ billion was settled with the relinquished $39~\\mathrm{GHz}$ licenses. The remaining balance was settled in cash of \\$1.6 billion, of which $\\$101$ million was paid during the fourth quarter in 2019. In connection with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $\\$1.2$ billion (\\$914 million after-tax) was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the previously held licenses for new licenses had commercial substance. See Note 4 for additional information. The new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and are included in Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets. \nIn September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. Verizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder on 557 licenses in the $3.5\\:\\mathrm{GHz}$ band valued at approximately $\\$1.9$ billion for the licenses. Verizon made payments for these licenses in 2020 and received them from the FCC in March 2021. Upon receiving, these wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, based on qualifying activities that occurred, were reclassified from Deposits for wireless licenses to Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. \nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon was the winning bidder on 3,511 licenses, consisting of contiguous C-Band spectrum bands ranging between 140 and 200 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in all 406 markets available in the auction. Verizon paid $\\$45.5$ billion for the licenses it won, of which $\\$44.6$ billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $\\$7.7$ billion. During 2021, we made payments of $\\$1.3$ billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. In January 2022, we made additional payments of $\\$1.4$ billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives, which were accrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the spectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. \nThe carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 will consist of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses. The licenses were received from the FCC in July"

The acquisition positions Verizon as the leading prepaid, value and premium wireless carrier by expanding Verizon’s portfolio, bringing enhanced access of our wireless network and comprehensive suite of mobility products and services to a new customer base. \nIn accordance with the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of Tracfone's outstanding stock in exchange for approximately $\\$3.5$ billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, subject to customary adjustments, 57,596,544 shares of Verizon common stock valued at approximately $\\$3.0$ billion, and up to an additional $\\$650$ million in future cash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of the Verizon common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $\\$542$ million and represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. See Note 9 for additional information. The contingent consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn out period, as defined in the Tracfone Purchase Agreement. Payments related to the contingent consideration are expected to begin in 2022 and continue through 2024. \nTracfone's financial results are included in the consolidated results of Verizon from the Acquisition Date. \nThe Tracfone acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. We are currently assessing, as of the Acquisition Date, the identification and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values, which are determined using a combination of the income and market approaches, including market based assumptions. The purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the Acquisition Date. \nThe following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the consideration paid and payable to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Acquisition Date. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including related deferred income taxes, become available."

The new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and had a value of $\\$3.4$ billion. See Note 3 for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions. \nDuring 2021 and 2020, we renewed various wireless licenses in accordance with FCC regulations with an average renewal period of 11 years and 10 years, respectively. See Note 1 for additional information. \nAs discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In 2021, our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated carrying amount of the licenses as of the test date. In 2020 and 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. Our annual assessments in 2021, 2020 and 2019 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did not result in impairment. \nOur strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities."

There is a one or two year revolving period, as set forth in the applicable loan agreement, which may be extended with the approval of the financial institutions. Under the loan agreements, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty, but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity. In December 2021, we borrowed \\$4.3 billion under the loan agreements. The aggregate outstanding balance under the 2021 ABS Financing Facility was \\$4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.

We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device payment program. \n# \nThe following table displays device payment plan agreement receivables, net, recognized in our consolidated balance sheets: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{(dollarsinmillions)} \\\\\nAtDecember31, & 2021 $ 21,303 & 2020 \\\\\nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, gross &  & $ 17,959 \\\\\nUnamortizedimputedinterest & (358) & (453) \\\\\nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost Allowance(l) & 20,945 & 17,506 \\\\\n & (759) & (940) \\\\\nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, net & $ 20,186 & $ 16,566 \\\\\nClassified in our consolidated balance sheets: \\\\\nAccountsreceivable,net & $ 12,783 & S 11,601 \\\\\n & 7,403 & 4,965 \\\\\nOtherassets Devicepaymentplanagreementreceivables,net & $ 20,186 & $ 16,566 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables. \nIncluded in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, are net device payment plan agreement receivables of $\\$16.0$ billion and $\\$12.1$ billion, respectively, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 for additional information. We believe the carrying value of these receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model. \nFor indirect channel wireless contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the financed device payment term. \n# \nIn connection with certain device payment plan agreements, we may offer a promotion to allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order. When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair value for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is determined by considering several factors, including the weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the amount of the guarantee liability was $\\$77$ million and insignificant, respectively. \nWe may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in device. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the amount of trade-in liability was $\\$366$ million and $\\$70$ million, respectively. \nIn addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the customer’s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability."

        "text": "Device payment plan agreement receivables, net, does not reflect the trade-in liability, additional future credits or the guarantee liability. \n# \nWhen originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program. Verizon’s experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \"established customers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \"established customer.\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer for less than 12 months, the customer is considered a \"short-tenured customer.\" For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources. \nInternal data and/or external credit data are obtained from the credit reporting agencies, if available, to create a custom credit risk score for Consumer customers. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using proprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify the existence of the business with external data sources. \nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This includes an account level spending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a required down payment percentage for Business customers. \n# \nSubsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two models, one for new customers and one for existing customers. The model for new customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on less than 210 days as \"new customers.\" The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on 210 days or more as \"existing customers.\" \nThe following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2021, by credit quality indicator and year of origination: \nYear of Origination \n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\n(dollars in millions) &  & 2021 &  & 2020 & Prior to 2020 (1) & Total \\\\\nNewcustomers $ &  & 2,545 S & 589 & $ & 10 $ & 3,144 \\\\\nExisting customers &  & 13,983 & 3,736 &  & 82 & 17,801 \\\\\nTotal & $ 16,528 & $ & 4,325 & $ & 92$ & 20,945 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(1) Includes accounts that have been suspended at a point in time. \nThe data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2021. \nWe assess indicators for the quality of our wireless service receivables portfolio as one overall pool. As of December 31, 2021, wireless service receivables, at amortized cost, originating in 2021 and 2020 were $\\$4.8$ billion and an insignificant amount, respectively. \n# \nThe credit quality indicators are used in determining the estimated amount and the timing of expected credit losses for the device payment plan agreement and wireless service receivables portfolios. \nFor device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. \nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. \nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K"

The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of our proprietary custom internal scoring models that analyze the customer’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These custom scoring models assess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Since our customers’ behaviors may be impacted by general economic conditions, we analyzed whether changes in macroeconomic conditions impact our credit loss experience and have concluded that our credit loss estimates are generally not materially impacted by reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. For device payment plan agreement receivables and wireless service receivables, we consider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’s due date.

The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, Verizon reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 76 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. \n# \nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements on the annual grant date. \nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. \n# \nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved. \nThe following table summarizes Verizon’s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity: \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{(shares in thousands)} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{RestrictedStockUnits} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Performance Stock Units} \\\\\n & EquityAwards & LiabilityAwards & Equity Awards & Liability Awards \\\\\nOutstanding January 1, 2019 & 10,577 & 19,926 &  & 16,905 \\\\\nGranted & 3,169 & 5,814 &  & 4,593 \\\\\nPayments & (6,397) & (9,429) &  & (3,255) \\\\\nCancelled/Forfeited & (90) & (1,598) &  & (2,692) \\\\\nOutstanding December 31, 2019 & 7,259 & 14,713 &  & 15,551 \\\\\nGranted & 3,638 & 15,161 & 4,358 & 1,389 \\\\\nPayments & (3,814) & (9,311) &  & (7,160) \\\\\nCancelled/Forfeited & (182) & (1,004) & (116) & (143) \\\\\nOutstanding December 31, 2020 & 6,901 & 19,559 & 4,242 & 9,637 \\\\\nGranted & 4,079 & 16,845 & 5,353 & 1,692 \\\\\nPayments & (3,417) & (10,797) &  & (6,718) \\\\\nCancelled/Forfeited & (784) & (8,317) & (955) & (146) \\\\\nOutstandingDecember31,2021 & 6,779 & 17,290 & 8,640 & 4,465 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs was approximately \\$773 million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 2 years. \nThe equity awards granted in 2021 and 2020 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $\\$55.39$ and $\\$57.38$ per unit, respectively.

The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $\\$300$ million par outstanding). \nIn order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-year period. Those estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’s long-term asset allocation policy. \nThe assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows: \nHealth Care and Life \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nAtDecember31, & 2021 & 2020 & 2019 \\\\\nWeighted-average healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year & 6.20 % & 6.20 % & 6.30 % \\\\\nRate to which costtrend rategradually declines & 4.50 & 4.50 & 4.50 \\\\\nYear theratereachesthelevelitis assumedtoremain thereafter & 2029 & 2029 & 2027 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nThe Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that $45\\%$ to $55\\%$ of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt) and $44\\%$ to $54\\%$ of the assets are invested as liability hedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability) and a maximum of $10\\%$ is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names. \nPension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon common stock."

The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-thecounter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings. \nHedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager. These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their corresponding offering or private placement memoranda. \nCommingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited partnership investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total investments."

The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in the current period, partially offset by the non-recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a series of legal entity restructurings.

The majority of Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable. \nAt December 31, 2021, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $\\$2.2$ billion that primarily relate to state and foreign taxes. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $\\$1.7$ billion will expire between 2022 and 2041 and approximately $\\$554$ million may be carried forward indefinitely. \nDuring 2021, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $\\$609$ million primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media. The $\\$1.6$ billion valuation allowance at December 31, 2021, is primarily related to state and foreign net operating losses and credits. \n# \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n & 2021 & 2020 & 2019 \\\\\nBalanceatJanuary1, & 2,944 S & 2,870 & 2,871 \\\\\nAdditionsbased on taxpositions related to the currentyear & 150 & 160 & 149 \\\\\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years & 621 & 258 & 297 \\\\\nReductionsfortaxpositionsofprioryears & (330) & (166) & (300) \\\\\nSettlements & (163) & (46) & (58) \\\\\nLapses ofstatutes oflimitations & (88) & (132) & (89) \\\\\nBalanceatDecember31, & 3,134 $ & 2,944 S & 2,870 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nncluded in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is $\\$2.8$ billion, $\\$2.5$ billion and $\\$2.4$ billion, espectively, that if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate. \nWe recognized the following net after-tax (benefit) expenses related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\nYearsEndedDecember31. & (dollars in millions) \\\\\n2021 & (21) \\\\\n2020 & 5 \\\\\n2019 & 35 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

The uncertain tax benefits related to the acquisition of Tracfone involve pre-acquisition tax matters and are the subject of an indemnity from América Móvil for which a corresponding indemnity asset has been established. \nVerizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are under audit by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2015-2018 and Cellco's U.S. income tax return for tax years 2017-2018. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2006. The amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{l}\n \\\\\nNote 13. Segment Information \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. \nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\nSegment & Description \\\\\nVerizon ConsumerGroup & Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services areprovided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in theU.S.under theVerizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 1o0% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. \\\\\nVerizon Business Group & Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long \\\\\n & distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products.We also provide FWA broadbandthrough h our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless andwireline carriers across theU.S.and selectproducts and services to customers around the \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nOur Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. \nCorporate and other primarily includes insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses including Verizon Media, and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. \nWe completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. \nThe reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of special items that the chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature."

Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period."

        "text": "Verizon is currently involved in approximately 20 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business. \nSubsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, without modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-off of our domestic print and internet yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may offset each other. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely. \nAs of December 31, 2021, letters of credit totaling approximately $\\$674$ million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2021, Verizon entered into seven renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 13 signed in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur through 2024, as applicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $\\$23,8$ billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, \\$10.2 billion is attributable to 2022, $\\$8.7$ billion is attributable to 2023, $\\$5.6$ billion is attributable to 2024, \\$4.2 billion is attributable to 2025, \\$482 million is attributable to 2026 and $\\$641$ million is attributable to years thereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2021, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. \n# \nNone. \n# \n# \nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal Control– Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. \n# \nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years."

        "text": "As the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. \nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n# \nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the company. Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of the company using the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. \nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), which the Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's acquisition of Tracfone. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Tracfone represented approximately $3\\%$ of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than $1\\%$ of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended. \nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Based on this assessment, management believes that the internal control over financial reporting of the company is effective as of December 31, 2021. In connection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by management. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has provided an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n# \nNone. \n# \nNot applicable. \n# \n# \nSet forth below is information with respect to our current executive officers. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nName & Age & Office & HeldSince \\\\\nHansVestberg & 56 & ChairmanandChiefExecutiveOfficer & 2019 \\\\\nManonBrouillette & 53 & ExecutiveVice President and Group CEO-Verizon Consumer & 2022 \\\\\nMatthewD.Ellis & 50 & ExecutiveVicePresidentandChiefFinancialOfficer & 2016 \\\\\nTamiA.Erwin & 57 & ExecutiveVicePresident and Group CEO-VerizonBusiness & 2019 \\\\\nSamanthaHammock & 43 & ExecutiveVicePresidentandChiefHumanResourcesOfficer & 2021 \\\\\nKyle Malady & 54 & ExecutiveVicePresidentandChiefTechnologyOfficer & 2019 \\\\\nRima Qureshi & 57 & Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer & 2017 \\\\\nCraigL.Silliman & 54 & ExecutiveVicePresidentandChiefAdministrative,LegalandPublicPolicyOfficer & 2019 \\\\\nAnthonyT.Skiadas & 53 & SeniorVicePresidentandController & 2013 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nEach of the above officers has held the indicated office or other high-level managerial positions with the Company or one of its subsidiaries for at least five years, with the exception of Hans Vestberg, who has been with the Company since 2017, Manon Brouillette, who has been with the Company since 2021, Samantha Hammock, who has been with the Company since 2020, and Rima Qureshi, who has been with the Company since 2017.
