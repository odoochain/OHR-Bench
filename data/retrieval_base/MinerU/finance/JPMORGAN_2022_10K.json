The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers, predominantly in the U.S., and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients globally. \nJPMorgan Chase’s principal bank subsidiary is JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 48 states and Washington, D.C. JPMorgan Chase’s principal non-bank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan Securities”), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and nonbank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firm’s principal operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are J.P. Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan SE (“JPMSE”), which are subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and are based in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Germany, respectively. \nThe Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available on its website, free of charge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov. JPMorgan Chase makes new and important information about the Firm available on its website at https://www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the Investor Relations section of its website at https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on the Firm's website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K” or “Form 10-K”) or the Firm’s other filings with the SEC. The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, treasury, tax or investor relations role. The Code of Ethics is also available in print upon request to the Firm’s Investor Relations team. Within the time period required by the SEC, JPMorgan Chase will post on its website any amendment to the Code of Ethics and any waiver applicable to a director or executive officer. \n# \nFor management reporting purposes, JPMorgan Chase’s activities are organized into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate segment. The Firm’s consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking (“CCB”) segment. The Firm’s wholesale business segments are the Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”), Commercial Banking (“CB”), and Asset & Wealth Management (“AWM”). \nA description of the Firm’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the “Business segment results” section of Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“Management’s discussion and analysis” or “MD&A”), beginning on page 46 and in Note 32. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge, including firms that offer products and services solely through the internet and non-financial companies that offer products and services that disintermediate traditional banking products and services offered by financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase."

The information provided below relates to JPMorgan Chase’s full-time and part-time employees and does not include the Firm’s contractors. \n# \nAs of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase had 293,723 employees globally, an increase of 22,698 employees from the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to additional employees in technology and operations, as well as front office.

        "text": "# \nThe foundations of JPMorgan Chase’s culture are its core values and How We Do Business Principles, which are fundamental to the Firm’s success and are represented by four central corporate tenets: exceptional client service; operational excellence; a commitment to integrity, fairness and responsibility; and cultivation of a great team and winning culture. The Firm maintains its focus on its culture of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of Conduct and by increasing employee awareness, education, communication and training. An important part of these efforts includes the Firm’s Business Resource Groups, which are groups of employees who support JPMorgan Chase’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. The Firm has global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence that lead the Firm’s strategy in supporting its commitments to create more equity and lasting impact in communities, and strengthen its inclusive culture. \n# \nThe goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external candidates and internal employees who are seeking a different role with challenging and stimulating career opportunities. These opportunities range from internship training programs for students to entry-level, management and executive careers. During 2022, approximately twothirds of the Firm’s employment opportunities were filled by external candidates, with the remainder filled by existing employees. In addition, depending on business needs, and where appropriate, the Firm has implemented hybrid work models which include a mix of on-site and remote work for certain roles. \nDiversity is an important area of focus throughout the Firm’s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, $\\mathsf{L G B T Q+}$ individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. The Firm’s global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence seek to increase representation of and advance career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and mentorship. \nJPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce. In addition, and where appropriate, the Firm’s hiring practices focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees held. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase supports the professional development and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training curriculum is required for new hires, which covers, among other topics, compliance with the Firm’s Code of Conduct and information concerning Firm policies and standards, \nincluding those relating to cybersecurity. In addition, the Firm offers extensive training programs and educational resources to all employees, covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership, change management, analytical thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, and risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm’s global leadership and management development center of excellence, is focused on creating one Firmwide leadership culture. \n# \nThe Firm provides market-competitive compensation and benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s compensation philosophy includes guiding principles that drive compensation-related decisions across the Firm, and includes: pay-for-performance practices designed to attract and retain top talent; responsiveness and alignment with shareholder interests; and reinforcement of the Firm’s culture and How We Do Business Principles, including the integration of risk, controls and conduct considerations. The Firm’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all employees includes compensation review processes that seek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are paid equitably and competitively for the work they do. \nThe Firm also supports employees’ well-being. JPMorgan Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to employees and their families, including healthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, on-site health and wellness centers, counseling and resources related to mental health, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, and financial coaching. In 2022, the Firm implemented or announced enhancements to certain health and wellness benefits for U.S. employees, including expanded medical plan coverage and paid time off policies related to parental, critical caregiving and bereavement leaves."

        "text": "# \n# \nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. \n# \nConsolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities or licenses of those subsidiaries. \nJPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). \nJPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.- based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). \nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated by the European Central Bank (“ECB”) as well as the local regulators in each of the countries in which it operates. The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities, as applicable, in the countries in which they operate. \nPermissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other than those permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company engaged in such activities. \n\nCapital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the international Basel III capital and liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity requirements. \nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104. \nStress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2023. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2023 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The Firm’s final SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 2023. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more information concerning the Firm’s CCAR. \nEnhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk"

        "text": "management standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities. \nResolution and recovery. The Firm is required to maintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually, summarizing the actions it would take to remain wellcapitalized and well-funded in order to avoid failure in the case of an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of material distress or failure (a “resolution plan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the regulations governing resolution plan requirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the Firm’s resolution plan submissions will alternate between “targeted” and “full” plans. The Firm’s “targeted” resolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021, and the Firm's next \"full\" resolution plan is due to be filed on or before July 1, 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and submit a separate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC on or before December 1, 2023. \nCertain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local resolution and recovery planning requirements. \nOrderly liquidation authority. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly liquidation authority.” The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. \nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve. \nRegulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to requirements, limitations and prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they acquire more than $5\\%$ of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed $10\\%$ of the total liabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must \nprovide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $\\$10$ billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader range of activities (including acquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible acquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. \nOngoing obligations. The Firm is subject to obligations under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the Department of Justice on September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations as well as under a related order issued by the CFTC. \n# \nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank. \nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s creditors. \nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. \nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s risk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. \nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2023, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking regulators.

Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depositary institution (“IDI”) for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in nonU.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders. \nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In February 2023, the CFPB proposed a rule that would significantly reduce and limit the late payment fees that credit card issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to charge to customers. The Firm’s consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency of each state. \nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides retail investment management services through Nutmeg Saving and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of financial services in the U.K., including obligations relating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation. \n\n# \nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the financing of client purchases, capital structure, recordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96 for information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc. \n# \nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered investment advisers in the United States are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state and federal law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities are subject to supervision by the OCC. \n# \nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC as “security-based swap dealers”. As a result, these entities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar requirements have also been established under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K."

Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association. \n# \nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations globally concerning data, including data protection, consumer protection, privacy, cybersecurity and related matters. These laws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or government bodies, and will continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and operations. \n# \nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and EU and U.K. authorities which target entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in activities including terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations. The Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other jurisdictions in which it operates, including those that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying with certain laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject. \n# \nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. \n# \nThe Firm’s compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies including under CRD V which in certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation policies. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices. \nOther significant international regulatory initiatives: Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a program of regulatory enhancements relating to financial services, several key elements of which are discussed below. \nMiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on specified trading venues. MiFID II also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission (“EC”) published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related to transparency and market structure, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to increase transparency into trading across the EU by providing a centralized source of market data. This legislation remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council. \nIn the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the “Wholesale Markets Review”, a set of proposals designed to streamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary markets following the U.K.’s departure from the EU. Some of the changes, such as the removal of the requirement to execute trades in shares on certain trading venues, have been introduced through the Financial Services and Markets Bill (“FSMB”), which is expected to be passed by the U.K. Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as amendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency, will be subject to further consultation, which is expected during 2023."

These proposals are subject to further review by the European Parliament and European Council. \nThe EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”) which will impose requirements relating to sourcing of securities in the event of a settlement fail. In June 2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment to postpone the application of these rules until November 2025. The amendment remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council. \nIn December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extensive package of reforms to U.K. financial services regulation known as the “Edinburgh Reforms”. These reforms aim to drive growth and competitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector following the U.K.’s departure from the EU. The reform package includes initiatives relating to a number of areas of financial services policy, including retail banks, payments, markets, digital assets and sustainable finance. The U.K. Government and regulators are expected to release further consultations and announcements related to these reforms in 2023. \nEU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules implementing the Basel III framework during 2023. The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III final rules by January 2025, allowing for certain transitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032, respectively. The main changes implemented by the Basel III final rules will be revisions to the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to reduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling approaches and introduce internationally-agreed changes to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III final rules also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors overseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities to systematically identify, disclose and manage environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) risks as part of their risk management practices. In addition, in December 2022, the European Banking Authority (“EBA”) announced that it will publish rules and technical standards between 2023 and 2025 related to sustainable finance, which will be applicable to EU banks. The Firm’s banking entities in the U.K. will be required to comply with regulatory policies and standards related to climate risk being developed by the PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking (“IPU”) located in the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with “home country” bank separation rules or impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the EU’s IPU requirements by December 30, 2023. \nThe Firm’s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also subject to supervisory expectations published by the ECB and the PRA, respectively, for management of financial risks arising from climate change and the increasing operational reliance on IT systems, third-party services and innovative technologies, as well as supervisory expectations for operational resilience and resilience from macrofinancial and geopolitical shocks. These expectations address bank strategy, governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure. \n\nPolicymakers in the EU have continued to implement sustainability-related initiatives. In December 2022, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The CSRD will replace and significantly expand the scope and content of ESG reporting requirements under the EU’s existing ESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will be phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC published its legislative proposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) in February 2022. The draft directive sets mandatory due diligence obligations for companies to address actual and potential human rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming from their own operations and business relationships, including the activities of companies with which they have established business relationships. The proposed legislation may also require the adoption of company-specific climaterelated transition plans. The CSDDD is currently subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the Firm’s EU entities as well as to certain non-EU entities."

Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings. \n# \nThe principal risk factors that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation include: \nRegulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated and supervised financial services industry, as well as changes to or in the application, interpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can have on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations; the ways in which differences in financial services regulation in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s business; the penalties and collateral consequences, and higher compliance and operational costs, that JPMorgan Chase may incur when resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways in which less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain countries can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results; and the losses that security holders will absorb if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into a resolution. \nPolitical risks, including the potential negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses due to economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments. \nMarket risks, including the effects that economic and market events and conditions, governmental policies, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and market fluctuations can have on JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale businesses and its investment and market-making positions and on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and its liquidity and capital levels. \nCredit risks, including potential negative effects from adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and central counterparties; and the potential for losses due to declines in the value of collateral in stressed market conditions or from concentrations of credit and market risk. \nLiquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired by market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; the adverse effects that any downgrade in any of JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may have on its liquidity and cost of funding; and potential negative impacts, including litigation risks, associated with the transition to alternative reference rates. \n\nCapital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its business activities. \nOperational risks, including risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s dependence on its operational systems, its ability to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces and the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees, as well as the systems and employees of third parties, market participants and service providers; the potential negative effects of failing to identify and address operational risks related to the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms; legal and regulatory risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase or by other extraordinary events; risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its stress testing and financial statements, and controls over disclosure and financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of failing to comply with heightened regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers. \nStrategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results that could occur if management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies; risks associated with the significant and increasing competition that JPMorgan Chase faces; and the potential adverse impacts of climate change on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers. \nConduct risks, including the negative impact that can result from the actions or misconduct of employees, including any failure of employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices. \nReputation risks, including the potential adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with its clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders that could arise from employee misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk"

JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business, and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. \nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly affects the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations, and JPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations. \nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to: \nlimit the products and services that it offers reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities \nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue   \npay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or other   \ngovernmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations   \nincur losses, including with respect to fraudulent   \ntransactions perpetrated against its customers   \ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous   \nimpose restrictions on certain business activities, or increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them. \nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in: \nincreased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny regulatory and governmental enforcement actions the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions increased exposure to litigation, or harm to its reputation. \n# \nThe content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example: \nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision, regulation and   \nregulatory scrutiny   \nfinancial technology companies and other non  \ntraditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same   \nresources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or   \nthe financial services regulatory framework in a   \nparticular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction. \nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products. \nThere can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business.

These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to: \nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate holdin companies or operating subsidiaries requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries to implement processes within locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory requirements the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities the resolution of financial institutions requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”) position limits and reporting rules for derivatives governance and accountability regimes • conduct of business and control requirements, and restrictions on compensation. \nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to: \ndivest assets or restructure its operations   \nabsorb increased capital and liquidity costs   \nincur higher operational and compliance costs   \nchange the prices that it charges for its products and   \nservices   \ncurtail the products and services that it offers to its   \ncustomers and clients   \ncurtail other business opportunities, including   \nacquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise   \nwould have pursued become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or   \nincur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. \n\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies.

These types of admissions can lead to: \ngreater exposure in litigation damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or other direct and indirect adverse effects. \nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions.

For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. \nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers. \nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company. \nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. \nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. \nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy. \n# \n# \nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including: \nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those   \nactions   \nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending   \nactions that governments take or fail to take in   \nresponse to the effects of health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken   \ngovernmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk, or more generally, the impact of business   \nactivities on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, and the management of climate and ESG-related risks   \nisolationist foreign policies   \nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other   \ngeopolitical instabilities   \neconomic or financial sanctions   \nthe implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or   \nother governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures. \nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could: \nerode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other   \ncountries and otherwise heighten tensions in   \nregulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations   \nlead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”)   \nincrease concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time"

In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. \nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding \nstudent loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations. \nJPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including: \npolicies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income. \n# \nIn JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses: \nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices. \nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress. \nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or"

Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance. \nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses. \n# \nWhen interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to: \nfewer originations of commercial and residential real   \nestate loans   \nlosses on underwriting exposures or incremental client  \nspecific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for   \ncredit losses and net charge-offs due to higher   \nfinancing costs for clients   \nthe loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw   \ndeposits because they believe that interest rates   \noffered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those of   \ncompetitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect   \nassumptions about depositor behavior   \nlosses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in   \nthe investment securities portfolio   \nlower net interest income if central banks introduce   \ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated \nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings less liquidity in the financial markets, and higher funding costs. \nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. \nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause: \nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher  \nyielding instruments   \nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor   \nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management   \nstrategy, and   \na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues. \nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. \n# \nThe value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations."

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur. \n# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors. \nA default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches. \nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and \nlitigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. \nTransactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction. \nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses. \nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. \nThe financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations, can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets, including in circumstances where coordinated action by multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or disruption. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant. \n# \nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when: \nJPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds   \ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or   \ncounterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons. \nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant"

This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators. \nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited. \nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the \nU.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment. \nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses. \n# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as: \nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption   \nunforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices   \ndefault by a CCP or other significant market participant unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral   \nunexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and   \nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. \nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. \nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to: \nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements address obligations under its resolution plan, or satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities. \nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations."

The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company. \nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). \nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. \nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to: \npay interest on its debt securities pay dividends on its equity securities redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and fulfill its other payment obligations. \nThese arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including: \nexpected future profitability risk management practices legal expenses \nratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries regulatory developments assumptions about government support, and economic and geopolitical developments. \nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. \nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including: \nreducing its access to capital markets   \nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities   \ntriggering additional collateral or funding   \nrequirements, and   \ndecreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase. \nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. \n# \nRegulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain interest rate indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks”, and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants. However, there is no assurance that: \nany of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace   \narrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the   \ntransition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective, or   \na particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants, or that market   \nacceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates."

However, if market participants have not implemented effective operational and other arrangements to address the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase. \nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: \ntreated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments   \nfailed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest   \nmade inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates   \nengaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the   \nmanipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or   \ndisadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial   \ninstruments. \nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation. \n# \nMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders. \nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically \nImportant Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as: \nactions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations   \nactions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S.   \ngovernment in response to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial   \ninstitutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge   \nchanges in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s   \nbalance sheet or developments that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer   \ndelinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and   \nincreases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s SCB. \nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, such as: \nreducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase   \nrequiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the   \nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner   \ninconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital   \nmanagement strategy   \nconstraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or   \ncurtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations. \n# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely.

Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. \nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because: \nthe techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched   \ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of   \nsources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties   \nwhose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally   \nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the   \ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party   \nservice providers with which it does business, and   \nit is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being   \ndetected, might obtain access to other networks and systems. \nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: \nJPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services the acquisition and integration of new businesses, and the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-fromhome arrangements for employees. \nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or \ncommunications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees. \nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including: \nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems   \nmisappropriation of confidential information of   \nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,   \ncounterparties, employees or regulators   \ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems and those of its clients, customers and counterparties the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen,   \nmanipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions   \nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws   \nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,   \ncustomers, counterparties or employees   \nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures   \ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,   \ncustomers or counterparties   \nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and   \nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. \nThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack."

Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in: \npotential liability to clients, counterparties and customers   \nincreased operating expenses   \nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions   \ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation   \nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity   \nregulatory intervention, or   \nweaker competitive standing. \nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations. \n# \nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. \nIf an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could \nresult in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including: \nheightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan   \nChase’s systems   \nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations   \nincreased operational costs to remediate the   \nconsequences of the external party’s security breach, and   \nreputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure. \nAs JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase. \nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire.

Governmental authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in fines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations. \nImplementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can: \nincrease JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs   \nhinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers   \ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and \nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. \nNot all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means.

Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses. \nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers. Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers."

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. \nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could: \nhinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its   \ncounterparties   \nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event   \ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries disrupt market infrastructure systems on which   \nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely   \nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and   \nharm its reputation. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries.

Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or untimely risk reporting. \nMany of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previouslycorrelated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). \nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as: \n\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices   \ninherent limitations associated with forecasting   \nuncertain economic and financial outcomes   \nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market   \nconditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity   \nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments   \ntechnology that is introduced to run models or   \nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the   \ntechnology   \nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and   \nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations. \nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. \nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as JPMorgan Chase experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case. \nSome of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses."

These strategies relate to: \nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers the geographies in which it operates the types of clients and customers that it serves the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests the counterparties with which it does business, and the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. \nIf management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline. \n\nJPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons.

For example, aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by nonbank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants, including JPMorgan Chase. \nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies. \nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers.

Both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers. \nClimate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks include: \ndeclines in asset values, including due to the   \ndestruction or degradation of property   \nreduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase   \ninterruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and   \npopulation migration or unemployment in affected regions. \nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lowercarbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services.

This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. \nSocial and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies : \nwhose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or   \nwhose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities. \nActivists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties, and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders. \nThese and other types of activist criticism and actions directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses ESG concerns in its business activities. In all of these cases, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could: \nattract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies   \ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase   \nimpair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers   \ndiminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees   \nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers   \ncause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or   \notherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations. \nActions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that: \nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or   \na financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers. \nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:"

Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in: \nworldwide economic disruption   \nheightened volatility in financial markets   \nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by   \nwidespread sell-offs of investments   \nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region   \ndisruption of global trade, and   \ndiminished consumer, business and investor   \nconfidence. \nAny of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict. \n\n# \nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including: \nextreme currency fluctuations   \nhigh inflation   \nlow or negative growth, and   \ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt. \nThe governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as: \nprice, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and changes in laws, rules and regulations. \nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. \nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: \nwidespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general   \nstrikes   \ncrime and corruption"

In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S. \n# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. \nJPMorgan Chase’s increased use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain employees. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly. \n\n# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations. \nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. \nIf another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. \nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters."

        "text": "# \n# \n# \nThe duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain. The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close positions and reduce certain of its business activities and exposures connected with the war, and to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks. \nThe Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However, the Firm continues to monitor potential secondary impacts of the war, including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, that could have adverse effects on the Firm’s businesses. \nThe Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks. \nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk Management on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on pages 142-144 for additional information. \nFor purposes of this Form 10-K, “Russia” refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management framework; and “Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia. \n# \nThe Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final stages of the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs in accordance with the International Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, onemonth, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (“LIBOR Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the notional amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry milestones and recommendations published by National Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of the Firm’s remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The Firm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will remediate approximately $40\\%$ of the Firm’s remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives exposure will be remediated predominantly through contractual fallback provisions. \nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may not otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required to continue to publish the one-month, three-month and sixmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a “synthetic” basis which would allow market participants to use such rates through September 30, 2024. This proposal would apply to contracts that are outside the scope of the LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed publication of “synthetic” LIBOR are intended to facilitate, and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation. \nThe Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk management systems in connection with the transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its operational systems and models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative developments relating to the transition from LIBOR.

The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs. \n• In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets.   \n• In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities. \n# \nThe Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. \n• In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities.   \n• In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities and higher net originations of loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements. \n# \nThe Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. \n• In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.   \n• In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.   \n• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. \nRefer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 55-56, Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 163 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows."

The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. \n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors.

The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. \n# \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. \n# \nWhere business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally \nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular business segment. \n# \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. \nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. \nAs a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net interest income. During the period ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits."

The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a \nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common equity. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for additional information. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity.

As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of updates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB. \nRefer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional information on capital allocation. \n# \nThe following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated. \n\\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Year endedDecember31, (in millions, except ratios)} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Consumer \\& Community Banking} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Corporate \\& Investment Bank} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Commercial Banking} \\\\\n & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nTotalnetrevenue & $ 55,017 & $ 50,073 & $ 51,268 & $47,899 & $ 51,749 & $ 49,284 & $11,533 & $ 10,008 & 9,313 \\\\\nTotalnoninterestexpense & 31,471 & 29,256 & 27,990 & 27,087 & 25,325 & 23,538 & 4,719 & 4,041 & 3,798 \\\\\nPre-provision profit/(loss) & 23,546 & 20,817 & 23,278 & 20,812 & 26,424 & 25,746 & 6,814 & 5,967 & 5,515 \\\\\nProvisionforcreditlosses & 3,813 & (6,989) & 12,312 & 1,158 & (1,174) & 2,726 & 1,268 & (947) & 2,113 \\\\\nNet income/(loss) & 14,871 & 20,930 & 8,217 & 14,970 & 21,134 & 17,094 & 4,213 & 5,246 & 2,578 \\\\\nReturn on equity(\"ROE\") & 29% & 41% & 15% & 14 % & 25% & 20% & 16 % & 21% & 11% \\\\\nYearendedDecember31, & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Asset \\& Wealth Management} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Corporate} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Total} \\\\\n(in millions, except ratios) & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nTotalnetrevenue & $17,748 & $ 16,957 & $ 14,240 & $ 80 & $ (3,483) & $ (1,176) & $132,277 & $125,304 & $ 122,929 \\\\\nTotal noninterestexpense & 11,829 & 10,919 & 9,957 & 1,034 & 1,802 & 1,373 & 76,140 & 71,343 & 66,656 \\\\\nPre-provision profit/(loss) & 5,919 & 6,038 & 4,283 & (954) & (5,285) & (2,549) & 56,137 & 53,961 & 56,273 \\\\\nProvisionfor creditlosses & 128 & (227) & 263 & 22 & 81 & 66 & 6,389 & (9,256) & 17,480 \\\\\nNet income/(loss) & 4,365 & 4,737 & 2,992 & (743) & (3,713) & (1,750) & 37,676 & 48,334 & 29,131 \\\\\nReturn on equity(\"ROE\") & 25 % & 33% & 28% & NM & NM & NM & 14% & 19% & 12% \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nThe following tables present key metrics for Wealth Management, which consists of the Global Private Bank in AWM and J.P.

However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,   \nlargely offset by – a $\\$190$ million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and   \n• a $\\$1.1$ billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses driven by – $\\$950$ million in Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and – $\\$175$ million in Home Lending. \nThe prior year included a $\\$9.8$ billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB. \nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses."

(e) Global investment banking fees exclude money market, short-term debt and shelf securities. \n# \nThe following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. \nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as “inventoryrelated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the \ndifference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions."

        "text": "# \nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top $10\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next $22.5\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next $35\\%$ of industrywide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next $22.5\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom $10\\%$ of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year riskadjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. • Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included.

        "text": "Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and   \n• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. \n# \nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. \n# \n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters. \nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types: \nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment. Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. \n\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. \nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions. \nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. \nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk and control standards. \n# \nThe Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: \nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense own the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of controls to manage those risks."

        "text": "# \nResponsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM, which may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls. \nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which is separate from, and independently assesses and challenges, the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own processes. \nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO. \nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM. \n# \nThe LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm’s business and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. \n# \nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee."

Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board \nRisk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other managementrelated matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee. \nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate. \nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations.

Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significan decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength. \n# \nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm. \nCapital Risk Management’s responsibilities include: \nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics; Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite; Developing a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches; Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital management activities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules. \n# \nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital management. \nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management are to: \nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;   \nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;   \nPromote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of   \nstrength to its subsidiaries;   \nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized”   \nstatus for the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable   \nregulatory capital requirements; \nMeet capital distribution objectives; and Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy. \nThe Firm addresses these objectives through: \nEstablishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;   \nRetaining flexibility in order to react to a range of   \npotential events; and   \nRegular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels. \n# \nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees. \n# \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year. \nOn June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had completed the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test process.

In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary. \n# \nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress. \n# \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time. \n# \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. \nBasel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators. \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93 for additional information. \nKey Regulatory Developments \nCECL regulatory capital transition. \nUntil December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected a two year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $\\$2.9$ billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at $25\\%$ per year over a threeyear period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s CET1 capital reflected the remaining $\\$2.2$ billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. \nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out $25\\%$ of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. \nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance."

        "text": "# \nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $\\$40$ billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized RWA."

        "text": "Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect. \nAll banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of $4.5\\%$ of risk-weighted assets. \nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of $2.5\\%$ for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable SCB requirement, floored at $2.5\\%$ , for Standardized regulatory capital requirements. \nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. “Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”."

The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is $4.5\\%$ . Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to $4.5\\%$ on January 1, 2024. \nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at $0\\%$ . The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional $2.5\\%$ of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. \nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments. \n# \nThe Firm’s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is $13.0\\%$ for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to $13.5\\%$ for the first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect. \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity   \nThe Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for   \nadditional information. Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements   \nSupplementary leverage ratio   \nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of $3.0\\%$ . Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional $2.0\\%$ leverage buffer. \n\nThe SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure. \nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments. \nOther regulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information. \nAdditional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27.

Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities include: \nDefining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;   \nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;   \nPerforming an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness based on LRM’s Independent Review Framework;   \nMonitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and   \nApproving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions. \n# \nTreasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management. The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management are to: \nEnsure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and   \nManage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources. \nThe Firm addresses these objectives through: \nAnalyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and   \noperational restrictions;   \nDeveloping internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entityspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and   \ncontingency funding plans;   \nManaging liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;   \nManaging compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and   \nSetting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity   \ncharacteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items. \nAs part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to: \nOptimize liquidity sources and uses;   \nMonitor exposures;   \nIdentify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm’s legal entities; and   \nMaintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. \n# \nCommittees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee.

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio. \nThe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR. \n# \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $\\$694$ billion and $\\$914$ billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above. \nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $\\$323$ billion and $\\$308$ billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased credit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity."

Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured \nlong-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC.

A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. \nAverage deposits were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting: \n• growth in CCB from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers, partially offset by a decline in deposits starting in the second half of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending, and • net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by migration into investments starting in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of the rising interest rate environment partially offset by • lower average deposits in CIB and CB due to attrition, also as a result of the rising interest rate environment. \nPeriod-end deposits decreased reflecting: \n• attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,   \n• net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate environment, and a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts. \nThe increase in deposits for both spot and averages in Corporate was driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives. \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends. \nCertain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $\\$1,383,7$ billion and $\\$1,489.6$ billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits."

        "text": "# \n# \nThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it \nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. \nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements. \nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, were as follows: \n\\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}\n & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{JPMorgan Chase \\&Co.} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{J.P.MorganSecuritiesLLC J.P.MorganSecuritiesplc J.P.Morgan SE (a)} \\\\\nDecember31,2022 & Long-term issuer & Short-term issuer & Outlook & Long-term issuer & Short-term issuer & Outlook & Long-term issuer & Short-term issuer & Outlook \\\\\nMoody'sInvestorsService & A1 & P-1 & Stable & Aa2 & P-1 & Stable & Aa3 & P-1 & Stable \\\\\nStandard\\&Poor's & A- & A-2 & Positive & A+ & A-1 & Positive & A+ & A-1 & Positive \\\\\nFitchRatings & AA- & F1+ & Stable & AA & F1+ & Stable & AA & F1 + & Stable \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) In January 2022, the three rating agencies affirmed the credit ratings of J.P. Morgan SE, which are equivalent to the ratings previously assigned to J.P. Morgan SE's predecessors, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. and J.P. Morgan AG. \nOn September 29, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the Parent Company’s long-term issuer rating to A1 (previously A2) and changed the long-term outlook to stable (previously positive). All other ratings and outlooks of the Parent Company and those of the Firm's principal bank and nonbank subsidiaries were affirmed by Moody's. \nJPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price. \nCritical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings."

        "text": "# \nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. \n# \nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks. \nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities: \n• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework • Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval • Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines • Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure • Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management \n# \nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default. \nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information. \nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below. \n# \nStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and countryspecific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs. \nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. \nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. \nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including: \n• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes   \n• Loan syndications and participations   \n• Loan sales and securitizations   \n• Credit derivatives   \n• Master netting agreements, and   \n• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques \nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for: \n• Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and • Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. \nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans. \n# \nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decisionmaking, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors."

        "text": "# \n# \nLoans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real estate loans. \nThe following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators. \nResidential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. \nRetained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower gross charge-offs. \nLoans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $\\$15.7$ billion at December 31, 2022. This amount included $\\$5.1$ billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $\\$5.0$ billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $\\$36.3$ billion and $\\$30.0$ billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higherbalance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-forsale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(inmillions) & December31， 2022 & December31, 2021 \\\\\nCurrent & $ 659 & 689 \\\\\n30-89dayspastdue & 136 & 135 \\\\\n90ormoredayspastdue & 302 & 623 \\\\\nTotalgovernmentguaranteedloans & $ 1,097 & $ 1,447 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nAt December 31, 2022, $\\$152.7$ billion, or $64\\%$ of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies, were concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, compared with $\\$145.5$ billion, or $65\\%$ at December 31, 2021. \nAverage current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios were relatively flat. \nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate loans. \n# \nThe following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.

        "text": "# \n# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately $87\\%$ and $88\\%$ at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$70.9$ billion and $\\$57.1$ billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. \nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. \nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. \nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. \nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented. \nDerivative receivables \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nDecember31,(inmillions) & 2022 &  & 2021 \\\\\nTotal,netofcashcollateral Liquidsecuritiesandothercash &  & 70,880 $ & 57,081 \\\\\ncollateralheldagainstderivative receivables Total,netofliquidsecuritiesand &  & (23,014) & (10,102) \\\\\nothercashcollateral Othercollateral & $ & 47,866 \\& & 46,979 \\\\\nheldagainstderivativereceivables &  & (1,261) & (1,544) \\\\\nTotal,netofcollateral & $ & 46,605 5$ & 45,435 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable. \nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a $97.5\\%$ confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management. \nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk. \nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below. \nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk management process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts. \n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio. \nExposure profile of derivatives measures December 31, 2022 (in billions)"

Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. \nThe Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses.

In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure. \nThe effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,   \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and   \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $\\$23.2$ billion, reflecting a net addition of $\\$3.5$ billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of: \n• $\\$2.3$ billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and • $\\$1.2$ billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. \nDeterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at $5.6\\%$ in the second quarter of 2024, and a $1.2\\%$ lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024. \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{AssumptionsatDecember31,2022} \\\\\n & 2Q23 & 4Q23 & 2Q24 \\\\\nU.S. unemployment rate(a) & 3.8 % & 4.3 % & 5.0 % \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S.real GDp(b) & 1.5 % & 0.4% & 一 % \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & AssumptionsatDecember31,2021 \\\\\n & 2Q22 & 4Q22 & 2Q23 \\\\\nU.S. unemployment rate(a) & 4.2 % & 4.0 % & 3.9 % \\\\\nYoYgrowth in U.S.real GDp(b) & 3.1 % & 2.8 % & 2.1 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions: \n• Maintaining a market risk policy framework • Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk • Defining, approving and monitoring of limits • Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments \n# \n# \nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including: \n• Value-at-risk (VaR)   \n• Stress testing   \n• Profit and loss drawdowns   \n• Earnings-at-risk   \n• Other sensitivity-based measures \n# \nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level. \nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. \nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate. \nModels used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses.

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. \nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a $95\\%$ confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. \nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level. \nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. \nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress \ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions. \nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations. \nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 for information regarding model reviews and approvals. \nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a $99\\%$ confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models. \nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting)."

        "text": "# \n# \n# \nAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits. \nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios. \nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate. \nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as appropriate. \nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee. \n# \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level. \n# \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the \nFirm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. \nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. \nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors, including: \n• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments   \n• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time   \n• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and longterm market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)   \n• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change \nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans,"

These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. \n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits. \n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a positive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a negative impact, on the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of the \nFirm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information). \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nDecember31, (in billions) & 2022 & 2021 \\\\\nParallelshift: \\\\\n+100bpsshiftinrates & (2.0)$ & 5.0 \\\\\n-100bpsshift inrates & 2.4 & NM \\\\\nSteeperyieldcurve: \\\\\n+10obpsshiftinlong-termrates & 0.8 & 1.8 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinshort-termrates & 3.2 & NM (a) \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: \\\\\n+100bps shiftin short-termrates & (2.8) & 3.2 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinlong-termrates & (0.9) & NM (a) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. \nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher interest rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the $+/-100$ basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while $\\mathsf{a}+/{-100}$ basis points shift in long-term rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing. \nThe Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nDecember31, (in billions) & 2022 &  & 2021 \\\\\nParallelshift: \\\\\n+10obpsshiftinrates & $ & 0.7 & 0.8 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinrates & $ & (0.6) & NM \\\\\nSteeperyieldcurve: -100bps shiftin short-termrates & $ & (0.6) & NM \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: +1oobpsshiftinshort-termrates &  & 0.6 & 0.8 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. \nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021."

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. \n# \nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm. \nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes the following activities: \nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards   \nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk framework   \nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and   \nestablishing risk tolerance relative to a country   \nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and   \nstress across the Firm   \nManaging and approving country limits and reporting   \ntrends and limit breaches to senior management   \nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling models   \nand ratings indicators, for early identification of   \npotential country risk concerns   \nProviding country risk scenario analysis \n# \nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. \nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation. \nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables). \nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure. \n\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework: \nDeposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions   \nLending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received   \nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is   \nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received   \nCredit derivatives exposure is measured at the net   \nnotional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures \nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements."

        "text": "# \n# \nStress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. \n# \nCountry exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. \nFor country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. \nThe increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities. \nThe decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central bank of Australia and government debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates. \nAs of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $\\$500$ million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at the Russian National Settlement Depository.

Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk. \nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures. \nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a lowcarbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. \n# \nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for establishing the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risk. The Climate Risk Management function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk management frameworks, as appropriate. \nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include: \nSetting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across the Firm Developing metrics, scenarios, and stress testing mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts to the Firm Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure \nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and management of climate risks present in their business activities and for adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations. \n# \nThe Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure.

        "text": "# \n# \nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. \n# \nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. \nOperational Risk Governance   \nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the   \nmanagement of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework. \nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically. \n# \nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control selfassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk. \nOperational Risk Measurement   \nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the   \neffectiveness of the control environments and reporting the results to senior management. \nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. \nThe primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a $99.9\\%$ confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced. \nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital. \nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress testing processes. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR. \nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing The results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate."

Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans. \n# \nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors. \n# \nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as cybersecurity, business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing are provided below. \n# \nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with addressing these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations. \n# \nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, \ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. \nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks. \nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity risks. \nThird parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred. \nTo help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a Information Security Program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically provided with updates on the Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as the Firm’s efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events.

The organization consists of business aligned information security personnel that are supported within the organization by the following products and services that execute the Information Security Program for the Firm: \nCyber Operations • Identity & Access Management Governance, Risk & Controls Global Technology Product Security \nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other matters as appropriate. \nThe IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk. \nThe Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for certain employee roles such as application developers. Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information. \nBusiness and technology resiliency risk Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. \n# \nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings. \n# \nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to a high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards. \n# \nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business."

        "text": "# \n# \nEstimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. \nThe Firm uses models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis. \nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in detail below. \nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities. \nModels are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier. \nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. \nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as the Firm experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case. \nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques."

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • The allowance for lending-related commitments, and • The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. \n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP. \n• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI. \nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 127 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately $1.9\\%$ higher over the eightquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $2.8\\%$ in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly $3.1\\%$ lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $3.9\\%$ in the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately $8.4\\%$ in the third quarter of 2024. \nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: \n• The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.   \n• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.   \n• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. \nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the"

        "text": "# \nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: \n• An increase of approximately $\\$500$ million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of approximately $\\$2.2$ billion for credit card loans • An increase of approximately $\\$3.9$ billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. \nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2022. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. \n# \nThe following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

        "text": "# \nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \n# \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15. \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least $10\\%$ and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations. \nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with management’s current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of longterm growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates. \nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $\\$11.3$ billion and $\\$9.8$ billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022. \nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates"

        "text": "# \nto these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $\\$315$ million. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. \nJPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting period. \nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted. \nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance. \n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. \nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate. \nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes. \n# \nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves."

        "text": "# \n# \n# \n# \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \nChange in Accounting Principle   \nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial   \nstatements, the Firm changed the manner in which it   \naccounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. \n# \nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n# \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

        "text": "# \n# \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n# \nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfoliobased component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $\\$17.0$ billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $\\$785.9$ billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in \nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables. \n# \nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $\\$1.1$ trillion of its assets and $\\$453.7$ billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $\\$13.6$ billion of trading assets and $\\$37.8$ billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates, correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates, and Bermudan switch values. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge."

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation. \n# \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. \n# \nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. \nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. \nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the nonaffiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest. \n\nThe Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privatelyheld entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. \n# \nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. \nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. \nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \nTo assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment"

        "page_idx": 166,
        "text": "includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. \nTo assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. \nThe Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority votinginterest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. \nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs. \n# \n# \nThe Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a levelyield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information. \nRevenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. \n# \nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. \nGains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. \nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount."

        "text": "# \nTypical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty. \nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements. \n# \nFor JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nThe adoption of this guidance eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allows the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the postmodification effective interest rate, instead of the premodification effective interest rate. \nThe Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. See Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach. \nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $\\$600$ million and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $\\$450$ million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. \n# \n# \nThe adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses represented management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments. \n# \nThe following table identifies JPMorgan Chase’s other significant accounting policies and the Note and page where a detailed description of each policy can be found. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nFair value measurement & Note 2 & page 167 \\\\\nFair value option & Note 3 & page 188 \\\\\nDerivative instruments & Note 5 & page 194 \\\\\nNoninterest revenue and noninterest expense \\\\\nInterestincome andInterestexpense & Note 6 Note 7 & page 208 page 211 \\\\\nPension and other postretirement \\\\\nemployeebenefitplans & Note8 & page 212 \\\\\nEmployee share-based incentives & Note 9 & page 215 \\\\\nInvestmentsecurities & Note 10 & page 217 \\\\\nSecurities financing activities & Note 11 & page 222 \\\\\nLoans & Note 12 & page 225 \\\\\nAllowanceforcreditlosses & Note 13 & page 242 \\\\\nVariable interest entities & Note 14 & page 247 \\\\\nGoodwill and Mortgage servicing rights & Note 15 & page 255 \\\\\nPremises and equipment & Note 16 & page 259 \\\\\nLeases & Note 18 & page 260 \\\\\nLong-term debt & Note 20 & page 263 \\\\\nEarnings per share & Note 23 & page 268 \\\\\nIncometaxes Off-balancesheetlending-relatedfinancial & Note 25 & page 270 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{instruments,guarantees and other} \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{commitments} & Note28 & page 276 \\\\\n \\\\\nLitigation & Note30 & page 283 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below. \nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. \n# \nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the \nCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. \n# \nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risktaking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions. \nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: \nLiquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bidoffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. \nThe Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size."

        "text": "# \nUncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 184 of this Note for more information on such adjustments. \n# \nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models. \nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. \n# \nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. \nLevel 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are   \nquoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or   \nliabilities in active markets.   \nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.   \nLevel 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation   \nmethodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. \nA financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement."

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions)."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date."

        "text": "# \nThe following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. \nThe following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. \nYield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nCredit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgagebacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. \nPrepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. \nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. \nConditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s marketmaking portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. \nLoss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrumentspecific factors."

        "text": "# \nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. \nVolatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. \nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. \nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. \nInterest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. \nForward price – Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. \nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. \n# \nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm riskmanages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments."

        "text": "# \n# \nDerivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. \nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. \nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary. \n\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\nYearendedDecember31, (inmillions) & 2022 &  & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nCreditandfundingadjustments: \\\\\nDerivativesCVA & $ & 22 $ & 362 & (337) \\\\\nDerivativesFVA &  & 42 & 47 & (64) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI.

(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $\\$(918)$ million. \nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) recorded at a nominal carrying value. In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of $\\$914$ million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firm’s sale of 20 million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. \nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares that it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. As a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. \n# \nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table. \nFinancial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value \nCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their shortterm nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted."

Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense. \n# \nThe following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. \n• Loans and lending-related commitments: For floatingrate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery \ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to   \nsimilar entities or industries.   \nLong-term debt: Changes in value attributable to   \ninstrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market.   \nSecurities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that   \ncollateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial   \nadjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements."

        "text": "# \n# \nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for marketmaking or risk management purposes. \n# \nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. \n# \nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities. \nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variablerate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability. \nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. \nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. \nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. \nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. \nDerivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. \n# \nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services. \n# \nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. \nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 198-205 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes."

        "text": "Derivatives designated as hedges \nThe Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. \nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. \nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. \nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are \nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. \nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings."

        "text": "# \nIn addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables. \nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(inmillions) & December31,2022 & December31,2021 \\\\\nAggregatefairvalue ofnet derivativepayables & 16,023 & $ 20,114 \\\\\nCollateralposted & 15,505 & 19,402 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. \nLiquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{December31,2022} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{December31,2021} \\\\\n & Single-notch downgrade & Two-notch downgrade & Single-notch downgrade & Two-notch downgrade \\\\\n & 128 & 1,293 & 219 & 1,577 \\\\\n & 88 & 925 & 98 & 787 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.

The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2022 and 2021."

The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.   \n(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.   \n(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the tables above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.   \n(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losse related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.   \n(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value).

These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. \n(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. \nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. \n# \nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. \nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives."

        "text": "# \n# \nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $\\$1$ million of realized credit losses in a $\\$10$ million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. \nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. \n# \nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. \nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not included in the table below."

        "text": "# \n# \n# \nThe Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known. \n# \nThis revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. \nThe Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. \nThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nYearendedDecember31, (inmillions) & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nunderwriting \\\\\nEquity & $ 975 & $3,969 & 2,759 \\\\\nDebt & 2,732 & 4,853 & 4,362 \\\\\nTotalunderwriting & 3,707 & 8,822 & 7,121 \\\\\nAdvisory & 2,979 & 4,394 & 2,365 \\\\\nTotalinvestmentbankingfees & $ 6,686 & $ 13,216 & $ 9,486 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nInvestment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results. \n# \nPrincipal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including: \n• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and   \n• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments. – Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments. – Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. \nIn connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities. \nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to: \n• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. \nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities. \nIn the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. \nThe following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven marketmaking activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. \nTrading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB."

The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income. \nCredit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous cobrand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the cobrand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to cobrand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years. \nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their accumulated balances. \nThe Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their \ndependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants. \nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{AsoforfortheyearendedDecember31, (inmillions)} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Definedbenefit pensionandOPEBplans} \\\\\n & 2022 & 2021 \\\\\nProjectedbenefitobligations & (13,545) & (18,046) \\\\\nFairvalueofplanassets & 19,890 & 25,692 \\\\\nNetfundedstatus & 6,345 & 7,646 \\\\\nAccumulatedothercomprehensiveincome/(loss) & (1,916) & (453) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5.14\\%$ and $2.54\\%$ , respectively. \n# \nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI.

Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a \npension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan’s projected benefit obligation totaling $\\$4.0$ billion and $\\$2.6$ billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $\\$1.4$ billion in pre-tax AOCI.

        "text": "# \n# \nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted longterm share-based awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. \nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of $50\\%$ after two years and $50\\%$ after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding. \nPerformance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a threeyear period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to $150\\%$ of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. \nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. \nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in 2022 and grants in 2020 were not material. \nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. \nThe Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. \nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share."

        "text": "# \nAFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost. \nThe Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the security. \nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI. \nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security. \nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. \nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. \n# \nAllowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities. \nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast. \nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security. \nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. \n# \nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately $98\\%$ rated at least $\\mathsf{A A+}$ . \n# \nThe allowance for credit losses on investment securities was $\\$96$ million, $\\$42$ million and $\\$78$ million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n# \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nYearendedDecember31, (inmillions) & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nRealizedgains & $ 198 & 595 & $ 3,080 \\\\\nRealizedlosses Investmentsecuritiesgains/ & (2,578) & (940) & (2,278) \\\\\n(losses) & $(2,380) & $(345) & 802 \\\\\nProvisionforcreditlosses & $ 54 & $ (36) & $ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. \nSecurities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. \nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. \nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n# \nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. \nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. \nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements."

        "text": "# \n# \nThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: \nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,   \n“retained”)   \nLoans held-for-sale   \nLoans at fair value \nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm’s loans by category: \n# \nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. \n# \nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. \nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. \n# \nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. \nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. \nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. \nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. \nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. \n# \nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. \n# \nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due. \nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances: \nLoans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent. Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,"

The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. \nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. \nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering statespecific factors. \nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. \n# \nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. \nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. \nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and chargeoff policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. \n# \nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. \nInterest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. \nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. \nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets."

        "text": "# \nLoans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-forsale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. \nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. \n# \nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrowerspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. \nLoans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and welldefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. \nLoans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance. \n# \nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). \nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense."

        "text": "# \n# \nConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. \nThe following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nDecember 31,(in millions) & 2022 & 2021 \\\\\nResidentialrealestate & $ 237,561 & 224,795 \\\\\nAuto and other(a) & 63,192 & 70,761 \\\\\nTotalretainedloans & $3 300,753 & $ 295,556 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $\\$350$ million and $\\$5.4$ billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. \nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \nFor residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. \nFor scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events."

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. \nWhile the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.

FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. \n\nThe Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers.

In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit. \nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than $1\\%$ of total retained credit card loans. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nYearendedDecember31, （inmillions,except weighted-averagedata) & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nBalance of new TDRs(a) & 418 & 393 & 818 \\\\\nWeighted-averageinterestrateof loans-beforeTDR & 19.86% & 17.75 % & 18.04% \\\\\nWeighted-averageinterestrateof loans-afterTDR & 4.13 & 5.14 & 4.64 \\\\\nBalanceofloansthatredefaulted withinoneyearofmodification (b & A 34 & $ 57 & $ 110 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Represents the outstanding balance prior to modification.

The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. \nFor credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy."

        "text": "# \n# \nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. \nThe primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. \nManagement considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. \nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. \nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. \nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations."

        "text": "# \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,   \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and   \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. \nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. \n# \nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lendingrelated commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. \nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) \nversus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. \nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance. \nCollective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.   \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. \nThe majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. \nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateraldependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. \n# \nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management."

        "text": "The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. \nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. \n# \nTo determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. \nThe Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be \nrecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral). \nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. \nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective."

        "text": "# \nRefer to Note 1 on page 164 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs. \nThe following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{LineofBusiness TransactionType} & \\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{2022Form10-K Activity} \\\\\n &  & Securitizationoforiginatedcreditcardreceivables & pagereferences pages247-248 \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{CCB} & Mortgagesecuritizationtrusts & Servicingandsecuritizationofbothoriginatedand purchasedresidentialmortgages & pages248-250 \\\\\n & Mortgageandothersecuritizationtrusts & Securitizationofbothoriginatedandpurchased residentialandcommercialmortgages,andother & pages248-250 \\\\\n\\multirow{3}{*}{CIB} &  & consumerloans Assistingclientsinaccessingthefinancialmarketsin \\\\\n & Multi-sellerconduits & acost-efficientmannerandstructuringtransactions tomeetinvestorneeds & page250 \\\\\n & Municipalbondvehicles & Financingofmunicipalbondinvestments & pages250-251 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows: \n• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.   \n• Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other thirdparty transaction.   \n• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. \nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third parties. \n# \n# \nCCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. \nThe Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. \n\nThe underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. \nThe agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally $5\\%$ ). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $\\$6.1$ billion and $\\$7.1$ billion, respectively.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. \nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. \nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. \nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. \n# \nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts. \nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nYearendedDecember31, (inmillions) & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nTransfersofsecuritiestoVIEs \\\\\nu.S.GSEs and government agencies & $ &  & $ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. \nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to resecuritization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material. \nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the resecuritization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE."

The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with dealspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. \nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum $100\\%$ dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates $10\\%$ of the outstanding balance of commercial paper. \nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. \nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $\\$13.8$ billion and $\\$13.7$ billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. \nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $\\$10.6$ billion and $\\$13.4$ billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. \n# \nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor. \nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events"

        "text": "(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. \nHolders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. \n\nTOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. \nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllll}\n\\multirow{3}{*}{December31,2022} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{Assets} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{Liabilities} \\\\\n & Trading assets & Loans & Other(c) &  & Total assets(d) & Beneficial interests in VIE assets(e) & Other(f) & Total liabilities \\\\\n & \\multicolumn{9}{l}{VIE program type} \\\\\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts &  & 9,699 & $ & 100 $ & 9,799 & 1,999 $ & 2 $ & 2,001 \\\\\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits &  & 22,819 &  & 170 & 22,989 & 9,236 & 39 & 9,275 \\\\\nMunicipal bond vehicles & 2,089 &  &  & 7 & 2,096 & 1,232 & 10 & 1,242 \\\\\nMortgage securitization entities(a) &  & 781 &  & 10 & 791 & 143 & 67 & 210 \\\\\nOther & 62 & 1,112 & (q) & 263 & 1,437 & 一 & 161 & 161 \\\\\nTotal & 2,151 & $ 34,411 & $ & 550 \\& & 37,112 & 12,610 & 279 & 12,889 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{9}{l}{$} \\\\\n & \\multicolumn{5}{l}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Liabilities Beneficial} \\\\\nDecember 31,2021 (in millions) & Trading assets & Loans &  & Other(c) & Total assets(d) & interests in VIE assets(e) & Other(f) & Total liabilities \\\\\nVIE program type \\\\\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts &  & 11,108 & $ & 102$ & 11,210 $ & 2,397 $ & 1$ & 2,398 \\\\\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits &  & 19,883 &  & 71 & 19,955 & 6,198 & 41 & 6,239 \\\\\nMunicipal bond vehicles & 2,009 &  &  & 2 & 2,011 & 1,976 &  & 1,976 \\\\\nMortgage securitization entities(a) &  & 955 &  & 32 & 987 & 179 & 85 & 264 \\\\\nOther Total &  & 1,078 33,024 & (b) $ & 283 490 & 1,361 35,524 & 一 10,750 & 118 & 118 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\n(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.

        "text": "# \n# \nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. \n# \nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\\$30.2$ billion and $\\$26.8$ billion, of which $\\$10.6$ billion and $\\$9.4$ billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. \nThe Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $\\$5.8$ billion and $\\$6.8$ billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\\$8.2$ billion and $\\$10.5$ billion respectively. \n# \nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. \nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). \nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue."

If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \n\nThe Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed. \nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. \nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units."

The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. \nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience."

        "text": "The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm \nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. \nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\nAs of orfor theyearended December 31,(inmillions,except where otherwise noted) & 2022 & 2021 &  & 2020 \\\\\nFair value at beginning of period & $ 5,494 & $ & 3,276 & 4,699 \\\\\nMSR activity: \\\\\nOriginations of MSRs & 798 &  & 1,659 & 944 \\\\\nPurchase of MSRs & 1,400 &  & 1,363 & 248 \\\\\nDisposition of MSRs(a) & (822) &  & (114) & (176) \\\\\nNet additions/(dispositions) & 1,376 &  & 2,908 & 1,016 \\\\\nChangesduetocollection/realizationofexpectedcashflows & (936) &  & (788) & (899) \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: \\\\\nChanges due to market interest rates and other(b) & 2,022 &  & 404 & (1,568) \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: \\\\\nProjected cash flows(e.g., cost to service) & 14 &  & 109 & (54) \\\\\nDiscount rates Prepayment model changes and other(c) &  &  & 一 & 199 \\\\\nTotal changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions &  & 3 & (415) & (117) \\\\\n & 17 &  & (306) & 28 \\\\\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions Fairvalue at December 31, & 2,039 &  & 98 & (1,540) \\\\\n & $ 7,973 & $ & 5,494 $ & 3,276 \\\\\nChangeinunrealized gains/(losses)included inincome related to MsRs held at December 31, & $ 2,039 1,535 & $ & 98 $ & (1,540) \\\\\nContractual service fees,late fees and other ancillaryfees included in income & 584 &  & 1,298 & 1,325 \\\\\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions) Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31, (in billions)(d) & 0.8 &  & 520 & 448 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities $\\therefore{\\tt S M B S^{\\prime\\prime}})$ for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements."

These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. \nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense.

Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to $10\\%$ of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to $20\\%$ of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. \nThe Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). \nThe principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors. \nAt January 1, 2023, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $\\$34$ billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year."

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. \nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower."

        "text": "# \n# \nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. \n# \nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. \nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the noncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation. \n\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). \nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 277. \nFor additional information on the guarantees, see below. \nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit \n\\begin{tabular}{lllllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{December31, (in millions)} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2022} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2021} \\\\\n & Standbylettersofcreditand otherfinancialguarantees &  & Otherletters ofcredit & Standbylettersofcreditand otherfinancialguarantees &  & Otherletters of credit \\\\\nInvestment-grade(a) & $ &  & 3,040 & 19,998 &  & 3,087 \\\\\nNoninvestment-grade(a) &  &  & 1,094 &  &  & 1,361 \\\\\nTotalcontractualamount & $ & 27,439 & 4,134 &  &  & 4,448 \\\\\nAllowanceforlending-relatedcommitments & $ & 82 326 & 6 &  &  & 9 \\\\\nGuaranteeliability &  &  & 一 &  &  & 9 \\\\\nTotalcarryingvalue Commitmentswithcollateral & $ $ & 408 15,296 & 6 795 & $ $ & 476 14,511 & 999 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings.

        "text": "# \nThrough the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding $100\\%$ of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. \nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding $100\\%$ of the principal invested. \n# \nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less. \nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions. \nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount. \nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. \nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(in millions) & December31, 2022 & December31, 2021 \\\\\nNotionalamounts Derivativeguarantees & 59,180 & 55,730 \\\\\nStablevaluecontractswith contractuallylimitedexposure &  & 29,778 \\\\\nMaximumexposureofstable valuecontractswith \\\\\ncontractuallylimitedexposure Fairvalue & 2,063 & 2,882 \\\\\nDerivativepayables & 649 & 475 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. \n# \nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements. \n# \nMortgage repurchase liability \nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. \n# \nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. \nRefer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation. \n# \nThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae"

        "text": "# \nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277. \n# \n# \nIn connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“thirdparty purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. \n# \nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $\\$2,158.4$ billion, $\\$1,886,7$ billion, and $\\$1,4,7,3$ billion, respectively. \nClearing Services – Client Credit Risk   \nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the   \ncontract. \nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. \nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. \nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. \n# \nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. \nGuarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s \ncounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. \nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a $100\\%$ -owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 277 of this Note.

        "text": "# \n# \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. \nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $\\$0$ to approximately $\\$1.2$ billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. \n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $\\$300$ million and $\\$500$ million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. \nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $\\$31.5$ million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $\\$25$ million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. \nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $\\$1.1$ billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients.

A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. In November 2022, the Court refused permission to the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded. \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. \nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. \nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on \nappeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $\\$900$ million to the approximately $\\$5.3$ billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\\$700$ million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. \nOf the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visabranded payment card sales volume. \nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has moved to dismiss both complaints. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that"

        "text": "decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. \nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. \nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. \nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. \n\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. \n\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. \nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $\\$26$ million, $\\$426$ million and $\\$1.1$ billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future."

        "text": "# \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period."

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. \n# \nEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance. \nThe Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. \n# \n(Table continued on next page) \n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllllllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except ratios)} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Consumer\\& Community Banking} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Corporate\\&InvestmentBank} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Commercial Banking} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{Asset\\&WealthManagement} \\\\\n & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 & 2022 & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\nNoninterest revenue & $15,089 & $17,286 & $17,740 & $35,999 & $38,209 & $35,120 & $3,336 & $3,929 & $3,067 & $12,507 & $13,071 & $10,822 \\\\\nNet interest income & 39,928 & 32,787 & 33,528 & 11,900 & 13,540 & 14,164 & 8,197 & 6,079 & 6,246 & 5,241 & 3,886 & 3,418 \\\\\nTotalnetrevenue & 55,017 & 50,073 & 51,268 & 47,899 & 51,749 & 49,284 & 11,533 & 10,008 & 9,313 & 17,748 & 16,957 & 14,240 \\\\\nProvisionfor creditlosses & 3,813 & (6,989) & 12,312 & 1,158 & (1,174) & 2,726 & 1,268 & (947) & 2,113 & 128 & (227) & 263 \\\\\nNoninterest expense & 31,471 & 29,256 & 27,990 & 27,087 & 25,325 & 23,538 & 4,719 & 4,041 & 3,798 & 11,829 & 10,919 & 9,957 \\\\\nIncome/(loss)before incometaxexpense/ (benefit) & 19,733 & 27,806 & 10,966 & 19,654 & 27,598 & 23,020 & 5,546 & 6,914 & 3,402 & 5,791 & 6,265 & 4,020 \\\\\nIncometaxexpense/ (benefit) & 4,862 & 6,876 & 2,749 & 4,684 & 6,464 & 5,926 & 1,333 & 1,668 & 824 & 1,426 &  & 1,028 \\\\\nNetincome/(loss) & $ 14,871 & $20,930 & $ 8,217 & $14,970 & $ 21,134 & $ 17,094 & $4,213 & $5,246 & $2,578 & $4,365 & 1,528 $ 4,737 & $2,992 \\\\\nAverageequity & $50,000 & $50,000 & $52,000 & $103,000 & $83,000 & $80,000 & $25,000 & $24,000 & $22,000 & $17,000 & $14,000 & $10,500 \\\\\nTotal assets & 514,085 & 500,370 & 496,705 & 1,334,296 & 1,259,896 & 1,095,926 & 257,106 & 230,776 & 228,911 & 232,037 & 234,425 & 203,384 \\\\\nReturn on equity & 29 % & 41 % & 15 % & 14 % & 25 % & 20 % & 16 % & 21 % & 11 % & 25 & %EE & 28 % \\\\\nOverheadratio & 57 & 58 & 55 & 57 & 49 & 48 & 41 & 40 & 41 & 67 & 64 & 70 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "# \nThe table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\n & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2022versus 2021} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{2021 versus 2020} \\\\\n(Unaudited) & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Increase/(decrease) due to change in:} &  & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Increase/(decrease) due to change in:} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{} \\\\\nYear ended December 31, (On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) & Volume & Rate & Net change & Volume &  & Rate & Net change \\\\\nInterest-earning assets \\\\\nDeposits with banks: & $ &  &  &  & $ \\\\\nU.s. & (1,185) & 7,910 & 6,725 & $ & 308 & (383)$ & (75) \\\\\nNon-u.s. & 166 & 1,636 & 1,802 &  & (42) & (120) & (162) \\\\\nFederalfunds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements: \\\\\nu.s. & 267 & 1,625 & 1,892 &  & (66) & (976) & (1,042) \\\\\nNon-u.s. & 311 & 1,471 & 1,782 &  & 75 & (511) & (436) \\\\\nSecurities borrowed:(a) \\\\\nu.s. & 64 & 2,066 & 2,130 &  & (84) & 70 & (14) \\\\\nNon-U.s. & 69 & 423 & 492 &  & (13) & (56) & (69) \\\\\nTrading assets- debt instruments: \\\\\nu.s. & 375 & 1,509 & 1,884 & (1,267) &  & (259) & (1,526) \\\\\nNon-U.s. & (418) & 775 & 357 &  & 481 & 32 & 513 \\\\\nInvestment securities: \\\\\nu.s. & 1,061 & 2,534 & 3,595 & 1,170 &  & (2,474) & (1,304) \\\\\nNon-U.s. & (2) & 207 & 205 &  & (44) & (136) & (180) \\\\\nLoans: \\\\\nU.s. & 2,988 & 6,750 & 9,738 & 600 &  & (3,093) & (2,493) \\\\\nNon-u.s. & 148 & 1,328 & 1,476 & 355 &  & (85) & 270 \\\\\nAll other interest-earning assets, predominantly u.s. & 161 & 2,708 & 2,869 & 320 &  & (449) & (129) \\\\\nChange in interest income & 4,005 & 30,942 & 34,947 & 1,793 &  & (8,440) & (6,647) \\\\\nInterest-bearingliabilities \\\\\nInterest-bearing deposits: \\\\\nU.s. & 268 & 5,857 & 6,125 & 109 &  & (1,496) & (1,387) \\\\\nNon-u.s. & 161 & 3,265 & 3,426 &  & (55) & (384) & (439) \\\\\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements: \\\\\nU.s. & (466) & 3,327 & 2,861 &  & (6) & (635) & (641) \\\\\nNon-U.s. & 93 & 493 & 586 &  & 8 & (151) & (143) \\\\\nTrading liabilities - debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing liabilities:(6) \\\\\nU.s. & 206 & 2,523 & 2,729 &  & (43) & (272) & (315) \\\\\nNon-U.s. & 125 & 756 & 881 & 112 &  & 19 & 131 \\\\\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly u.S. & (69) & 212 & 143 &  &  &  & (131) \\\\\nLong-term debt: &  &  &  &  & (27) & (104) \\\\\nu.s. & 75 & 3,722 & 3,797 &  & (64) & (1,411) & (1,475) \\\\\nNon-u.s. & (31) & 27 & (4) &  & (12) & 5 & (7) \\\\\nChange in interest expense & 362 & 20,182 & 20,544 &  & 22 & (4,429) & (4,407) \\\\\nChange in net interest income & 3,643 & 10,760 & 14,403 & 1,771 & $ & (4,011)$ & (2,240) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Negative interest and rates reflect the net impact of interest earned offset by fees paid on client-driven prime brokerage securities borrowed transactions.

A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. \n# \nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. \n# \nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting \nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels.

The shares of each series of our preferred stock are represented by depositary shares, with each depositary share representing a fractional interest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series. Of the 18 series of our issued and outstanding preferred stock, depositary shares representing the following six series of preferred stock are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with each depositary share representing a 1/400th interest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series: \na. $5.75\\%$ Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD; b. $6.00\\%$ Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE; c. 4.75 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series GG; d. $4.55\\%$ Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series JJ; e. $4.625\\%$ Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series LL; and f. $4.20\\%$ Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM.   \nWe refer to the above six series of preferred stock herein collectively as the “Listed Preferred Stock”.   \nThe Listed Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable.   \nThe terms of the depositary shares are summarized below under “Description of Depositary Shares”. \n# \nThe Listed Preferred Stock ranks, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or windingup, on a parity with any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock and to any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock. The Listed Preferred Stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness. \n# \nHolders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates described below under “Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. We will pay each dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register on record dates determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on the Listed Preferred Stock are noncumulative. If a dividend is not declared on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, because the dividends are noncumulative, then the right of holders of that series to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period. \nWe may not declare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for payment, or we contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends on that series of Listed Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that series, all dividends declared and paid upon the shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the that series will be declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, we will allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividends due on shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of any series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock and (ii) in the case of any series of cumulative preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock. \nIn addition, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Listed Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment in respect of the applicable most recently completed dividend period, with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock: \na. no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our common stock or upon any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or windingup, and   \nb. no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally with that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such capital stock) by us, except: \ni. by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock; ii. as a result of reclassification into capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock; iii. through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of shares of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock or, in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock,"

Subject to the conditions described above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our common stock and any other capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. \nAs used herein, “junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to our common stock and any other class or series of our capital stock over which the Listed Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; “parity preferred stock” and “on a parity with a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity with the shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; and “senior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks senior to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require. \nWe will compute the amount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number of dividend periods in a year, except that the amount of dividends payable for any period greater or less than a full dividend period, other than the initial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any period less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. \n# \nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series of Listed Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the amount of $\\$10,000$ per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock of such series. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. \nIf, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, and any stock having the same rank as that series, the holders of that series and of that other stock will share ratably in any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are entitled. For any series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the sale of all or substantially all of our property or business, nor our merger or consolidation into or with any other entity will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary of or involuntary, of us. \nBecause we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and our stockholders, including the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock, to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon that subsidiary’s liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. \nHolders of the Listed Preferred Stock are subordinate to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets, including in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. In addition, holders of the Listed Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. \n# \nWe may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock on the dates and at the redemption prices set forth below under “Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. In addition, we may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to $\\$10,000$ per share (equivalent to $\\$25$ per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, following the occurrence of a capital treatment event.

At that time such right will terminate, except as expressly provided in the applicable certificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the preferred directors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in office will terminate immediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected.

Each depositary share represents a $1/400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ interest in a share of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, and is evidenced by depositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement relating to that series of Listed Preferred Stock.

Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to $1/400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of the dividend eclared and payable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock. \nThe depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock to the holders of record of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder.

If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the corresponding depositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be $1/400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Listed Preferred Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends. \nIf we redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Listed Preferred Stock so redeemed. If we redeem less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary will select pro rata or by lot those depositary shares to be redeemed. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares. The redemption of depositary shares that are held in book-entry form through DTC will be effected in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. \nVoting the Listed Preferred Stock. Because each depositary share represents a $1/400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ interest in a share of Listed Preferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to $1/400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of a vote per depositary share under those limited circumstances in which holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote. \nWhen the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to that Listed Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the applicable Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares."

Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary arrangement upon surrender of depositary receipts at the depositary’s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and fees provided for in the deposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of depositary receipts will receive the appropriate number of shares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn; if a holder holds an amount other than a whole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will deliver along with the withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive depositary shares. \nForm and Notices. Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the depositary shares representing that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC.

It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated May 25, 2001 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the $^{\\circ\\circ}2001$ Indenture”), between JPMorgan Chase, as issuer, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to the Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2001 Indenture for additional information. \n# \nIn June 2012, the maximum number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance was set at 129,000,000, resulting in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $\\$2,455,722,690$ .  All of the Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance were issued as of June 2012. 10,000,000 Alerian ETNs were retired on December 16, 2015.  Accordingly, since the retirement of these notes, the maximum number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance is 119,000,000 with an aggregate principal amount of $\\$2,265,356,590$ , all of which has been issued and remain outstanding as of December 31, 2019. \nThe Alerian ETNs are linked to the Alerian MLP Index (the “Index”) and are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.

The Index measures the composite performance of energyoriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, and is calculated and maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Calculation Agent”), in consultation with GKD Index Partners, LLC (the “Index Sponsor”), using a float-adjusted, market capitalization methodology.  MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural resource. \n# \nThe Alerian ETNs are denominated in U.S. dollars in minimum denominations equal to the $\\$19.03661$ per note (the “Principal Amount”), which is the amount equal to the Initial VWAP Level (defined below), divided by ten. \n# \nFor each Alerian ETN a holder holds on the applicable Coupon Record Date, holders will receive on each Coupon Payment Date the “Coupon Amount,” which is an amount in cash equal to the difference between (a) the Reference Distribution Amount (defined below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date and (b) the Accrued Tracking Fee (defined below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date. \nThe Accrued Tracking Fee accrues on a daily basis at a rate of $0.85\\%$ per annum, applied to the Daily Note Value as of the Index Business Day immediately preceding the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date.  The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative performance of the VWAP Level of the Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date. If the Daily Note Value increases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will increase, and if the Daily Note Value decreases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will decrease. The Daily Note Value is published on the Bloomberg Professional service (“Bloomberg”) under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP” and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP:IND.” \nOn any Index Business Day, the VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, and the VWAP of each Index Component is the volume-weighted average price of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent based on the Primary Exchange for that Index Component. \nTo the extent the Reference Distribution Amount on any Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date, there will be no coupon payment made on the corresponding Coupon Payment Date, and an amount equal to the difference between the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Reference Distribution Amount (the “Tracking Fee Shortfall”) will be included in the Accrued Tracking Fee for the next Coupon Valuation Date.  This will be in addition to the accrual at a rate of $0.85\\%$ per annum over the quarter that has elapsed since the previous date of determination.  This process will be repeated to the extent necessary until the Reference Distribution Amount for a Coupon Valuation Date is greater than the Accrued Tracking Fee for the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date (which includes the accumulated Tracking Fee Shortfall from all prior quarters).  This process may also restart as necessary on a subsequent Coupon Valuation Date.  Coupon payments on the Alerian ETNs will be payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date, provided that the final Coupon Payment Date will be the Maturity Date.  The final Coupon Amount will be included in the Cash Settlement Amount. \nHolders will receive no coupon payment on a Coupon Payment Date if the Reference Distribution Amount on the relevant Coupon aluation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the relevant Coupon Valuation Date. \nOn each Index Business Day, the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the value of the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Index Business Day (treating that immediately preceding Index Business Day as if it were a Coupon Valuation Date), which we refer to as the interim accrued Coupon Amount, and will publish the interim accrued Coupon Amount on Bloomberg under the ticker symbol “AMJEU” and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJEU:IND.” While the interim accrued Coupon Amount is calculated and published in connection with each such Index Business Day, the actual Coupon Amount will be calculated and paid only once each quarter. \n# \nSubject to a holder's compliance with the procedures and the potential postponements and adjustments as described under “Market Disruption Events” below, that holder may submit a request once a week (generally on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on Thursday) during the term of the Alerian ETNs to have us repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, provided that holder requests that we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs.  If a holder requests that we repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, subject to the notification requirements and the other terms and conditions set forth under “Repurchase Requirements” below, for each Alerian ETN that holder will receive a cash payment on the relevant Repurchase Date equal to the Repurchase Amount.  If the Repurchase Amount is $\\$0$ or less, the payment upon early repurchase will be $\\$0$ .  Because the Repurchase Amount is based on the value of the Index at the end of a five-day measurement period that begins after a repurchase request is received, holders will not know the Repurchase Amount they will receive at the time they elect to request that we repurchase their Alerian ETNs."

If the third Index Business Day following the date originally scheduled to be the final Averaging Date is not an Index Business Day or is a Disrupted Day with respect to such Index Component, the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, will determine the VWAP and share weighting with respect to any Index Component required to be determined for the purpose of calculating the applicable VWAP Level based on its good faith estimate of the VWAP and share weighting of each such Index Component that would have prevailed on the Primary Exchange on such third Index Business Day but for such suspension or limitation. \nAn “Averaging Date” means each of the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, subject to adjustment as described herein. \nA “Disrupted Day” with respect to any Index Component is any Index Business Day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing, and, in both cases, the occurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material effect on the VWAP Level. \nWith respect to an Index Component, a “Market Disruption Event,” means: \n(a) the occurrence or existence of a condition specified below: \n(i) any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Primary Exchange for trading in the Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the Primary Exchange or otherwise; (ii) any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Related Exchange for trading in futures or options contracts related to the Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by such Related Exchange or otherwise; or (iii) any event (other than an event described in (b) below) that disrupts or impairs (as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) the ability of market participants in general (A) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for the relevant Index Component or (B) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, futures or options contracts relating to the relevant Index Component; or \n(b) the closure on any Index Business Day of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange prior to its Scheduled Closing Time unless such earlier closing time is announced by the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier of (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session on the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day and (ii) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange system for execution at the close of trading on such Index Business Day; \nin each case determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion; and (c) a determination by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion that the applicable event described above materially interfered with our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to adjust or unwind all or a material portion of any hedge with respect to the Alerian ETNs. \n\nFor purposes of the above definition: \n(a) a limitation on the hours or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from an announce hange in the regular business hours of the Primary Exchange or Related Exchange, and \n(b) for purposes of clause (a) above, limitations pursuant to the rules of any Primary Exchange or Related Exchange similar to NYSE Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 (or any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any other self-regulatory organization or any government agency of scope similar to NYSE Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) on trading during significant market fluctuations will constitute a suspension, absence or material limitation of trading. \n“Scheduled Closing Time” means, with respect to the Primary Exchange or the Related Exchange, on any Index Business Day, the scheduled weekday closing time of the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day, without regard to after hours or any other trading outside of the regular trading session hours."

In such event, the Note Calculation Agent will cause notice thereof to be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs. \notwithstanding these alternative arrangements, discontinuation of the publication of the Index or successor index, as applicable, ay adversely affect the value of the Alerian ETNs. \nIf at any time the method of calculating the Index or a successor index, or the value thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the Index or a successor index is in any other way modified so that the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index does not, in the opinion of the Note Calculation Agent, fairly represent the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Note Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a VWAP level of an index comparable to the Index or such successor index, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the VWAP Levels for the Index or such successor index with reference to the Index or such successor index, as adjusted.  The Note Calculation Agent will accordingly calculate any values that reference the VWAP Levels based on the relevant VWAP Levels calculated by the Note Calculation Agent, as adjusted.  Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index or a successor index is modified so that the level of the Index or such successor index is a fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such modification (e.g., due to a split in the index), which, in turn, causes the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index to be a fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such modification, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such calculations and adjustments in order to arrive at a VWAP Level for the Index or such successor index as if it had not been modified (e.g., as if such split had not occurred). \n# \nIn case an event of default with respect to the Alerian ETNs shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per Alerian ETN upon any acceleration of the Alerian ETNs will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to the Repurchase Amount, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the first Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period and the four Index Business Days immediately succeeding the date of acceleration were the corresponding Index Business Days in the accelerated Repurchase Measurement Period.  For purposes of this calculation the Repurchase Fee Amount shall be zero. \nIf the maturity of the Alerian ETNs is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, we will, or will cause the Note Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs, of the cash amount due with respect to the Alerian ETNs as promptly as possible and in no event later than two Business Days after the date of acceleration. \n# \nThe Alerian ETNs have been listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “AMJ.”  No assurance can be given as to the continued listing of the Alerian ETNs for their term or of the liquidity or trading market for the Alerian ETNs."

These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2001 Indenture, which describes completely the terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it.  Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2001 Indenture.  Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2001 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement. \nThe debt securities will be our direct, unsecured general obligations and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. \nWe are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries.  As a result, claims of the holders of the debt securities will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, except to the extent that JPMorgan Chase & Co. may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries.  Claims of our subsidiaries' creditors other than JPMorgan Chase & Co. include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. \nEvents of Default and Waivers \nn “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture is defined in the 2001 Indenture as a. default for 30 days in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series; \nb. default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;   \nc. failure by us for 90 days to perform any other covenants or warranties contained in the 2001 Indenture applicable to that series after written notice has been given by the trustee to us or given by holders of at least $25\\%$ in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to us and the trustee;   \nd. specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary; or   \ne. any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture or form of security.

If a default in the performance of any covenant or agreement with respect to  all series of debt securities, or in a manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security with respect to all series of debt securities, or due to specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than $25\\%$ in aggregate principal amount of all debt securities then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10) \nAn Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities.  The 2001 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11) \nThe 2001 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2001 Indenture. (Section 5.09)  The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2001 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d)) \nNo holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than $25\\%$ in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06) \nHowever, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07) \nThe 2001 Indenture requires us to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not we have knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05) \nCovenant Breach \nUnder the 2001 Indenture, a “Covenant Breach” would occur with respect to a series of debt securities if we fail to perform or breach any of the covenants contained in the 2001 Indenture (other than a failure to pay principal or interest on the debt securities) and that failure or breach continues for 90 days after the Trustee or the holders of at least $25\\%$ in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities give written notice of that failure or breach.  Neither the Trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the debt securities as a result of any Covenant Breach. \nIf a Covenant Breach or Event of Default with respect to the debt securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders of the debt securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the 2001 Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the 2001 Indenture, or to enforce any other proper remedy."

Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would: \na. extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;   \nb. reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;   \nc. change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2001 Indenture applicabl to debt securities in foreign currencies;   \nd. change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt security;   \ne. reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;   \nf. adversely affect the terms on which debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable or payable in other securities, instruments, contracts, currencies, commodities or other forms of property;   \ng. impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security; or   \nh. reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification.

(Section 9.01) \nThere are no covenants or other provisions in the 2001 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change of control of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a highly leveraged transaction.  The merger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of our assets.  However, we may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which we would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement. \nConcerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent \nOur subsidiaries and we have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, registrars, authenticating agents and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture. \nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the trustee for other securities issued by us or JPMorgan Financial, including the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture, the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Financial's indenture for debt securities, to which we are a guarantor, and the warrants issued under JPMorgan Financial's warrant indenture, to which we are a guarantor.  Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2001 Indenture, and we would be required to appoint a successor trustee.  For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded."

Any payment on the Callable Notes issued by JPMorgan Financial is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the Callable Notes. \nThe Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A Notes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series A Notes, please see the section titled “— General Terms of the Series A Notes” below. \nThe Callable Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank. \nUnless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Callable Notes are registered on the books that the Issuer or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in the Callable Notes (registered in street name or otherwise). \n# \nWe issued the Callable Notes on June 10, 2021, in minimum denominations of $\\$1,000$ and in integral multiples of $\\$1,000$ thereafter. The Maturity Date of the Callable Notes is June 10, 2032.  Interest on the Callable Notes is payable semiannually on June 10th and December 10th of each year, beginning on December 10, 2021 to and including the Maturity Date (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), subject to any earlier redemption, at the Interest Rate of $2.60\\%$ per annum. \nOn June 10, 2031 (the “Redemption Date”), the Issuer may redeem the holders’ Callable Notes, in whole but not in part, at a price equal to the principal amount being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  Any accrued and unpaid interest on the Callable Notes redeemed will be paid to the person who is the holder of record on such Callable Notes at the close of business one (1) business day prior to the Redemption Date.  To redeem the Callable Notes, the Issuer will deliver notice to DTC, as holder of the Callable Notes, at least 5 business days and not more than 15 business days prior to the Redemption Date. \n# \nJPMS (the “Calculation Agent”) will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Callable Notes, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Callable Notes. \n# \nIn case an event of default with respect to the Callable Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per $\\$1,000$ principal amount note upon any acceleration of the Callable Notes will be determined by the Calculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to $\\$1,000$ per $\\$1,000$ principal amount note plus accrued and unpaid interest, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date.  In such case, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days in such adjusted Interest Period and will be based on the Interest Rate on the applicable date immediately preceding such adjusted Interest Period."

        "text": "If the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will cause the Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC of the cash amount due with respect to the Callable Notes as promptly as possible and in no event later than two business days after the date of acceleration. \n# \nThe Callable Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol “JPM/32.” No assurance can be given as to the continued listing for the term of the Callable Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the Callable Notes. \n# \nDTC will act as securities depositary for the Callable Notes.  The Callable Notes have been issued only as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, representing the total aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes, have been issued and have been deposited with DTC.  We will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances. \n# \nThe Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Callable Notes.  The Bank of New ork Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Callable Notes and may designate additional paying agents. \n# \nThe Issuer may, in its sole discretion, “reopen” the Callable Notes based upon market conditions at that time.  These further issuances, if any, will be consolidated with, have the same CUSIP number as and trade interchangeably with the respective originally issued Callable Notes immediately upon settlement and, consequently, will increase the aggregate principal amount of such outstanding Callable Notes.  The price of any additional offering will be determined at the time of pricing of that offering. \n# \nIn this “General Terms of the Series A Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series A Notes issued by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC. \nThe following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, including the Callable Notes. \nWe have summarized below the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued under the 016 Indenture. \nThese descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2016 Indenture, which describes completely the terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it.  Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture.  Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement. \nThe debt securities will be the Issuer’s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. \nThe Guarantor is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries.  As a result, claims of the holders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries, except to the extent that the Guarantor may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries.  Claims of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ creditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. \n# \nAn “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 Indenture as: \na. default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;   \nb. default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;   \nc. default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in the 2016 Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written notice has been given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least $25\\%$ in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee;   \nd. certain events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary;   \ne. the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, provided that no Event of Default with respect to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a receiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation; or   \nf. any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security.

        "text": "If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the Issuer, the guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than $25\\%$ in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a default due to specified events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable.  Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10) \nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.  In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities. Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the debt securities to be declared due and payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.  Instead, even if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the Trustee and the holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and payable unless there is an Event of Default with respect to that series as described above, such as the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation or a payment default by the Issuer or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities.  The value holders receive on any series of debt securities may be significantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the Issuer’s debt securities been declared due and payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor. \nAn Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities.  The 2016 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11) \nThe 2016 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2016 Indenture. (Section 5.09)  The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2016 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d)) \nNo holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than $25\\%$"

(Section 5.07) \nThe 2016 Indenture requires the Issuer and the Guarantor to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not he Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05) \nModification of the 2016 Indenture \nThe 2016 Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the 2016 Indenture or the rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would: \na. extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;   \nb. reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;   \nc. change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2016 Indenture applicable to debt securities in foreign currencies;   \nd. change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt security;   \ne. reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;   \nf. impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security;   \ng. reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification; or   \nh. make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of the debt securities of such series or release the Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Indenture. (Section 8.02) \nThe 2016 Indenture also permits the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to amend the 2016 Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s merger or the replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2016 Indenture or the Issuer’s debt securities that the Issuer deems necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. (Section 8.01) \nConsolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets \nNeither the Issuer nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all f their respective assets to any other entity, unless: \na. with respect to the Issuer:   \na. either the Issuer is the continuing company in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor entity in the case of a merger or consolidation (including an affiliate of the Guarantor) or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the Issuer, and   \nb. no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer, and   \na. with respect to the Guarantor:   \na. either the Guarantor is the continuing corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation that expressly assumes the full and unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the Guarantor, and   \nb. no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer.

        "text": "Any transfer of material assets of the Guarantor to any other entity that occurs as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, any proceedings relative to the Guarantor under Title 11 of the United States Code or under a receivership under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or under any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law will be deemed to be a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets. \nThere are no covenants or other provisions in the 2016 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor, a change of control of the Issuer or the Guarantor or a highly leveraged transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor.  The merger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of the Issuer or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s assets.  However, the Issuer may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which the Issuer would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement. \nJPMorgan Chase Guarantee \nThe Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all other amounts payable under the debt securities when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption, repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable debt securities or upon acceleration.  If for any reason the Issuer does not make any required payment in respect of the Issuer’s debt securities when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by the Issuer under the 2016 Indenture.  The guarantee is of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01) \nThe Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for any amount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by the Issuer, and (2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely from, or on account of, the Issuer’s insolvency or the Issuer’s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to the Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer. (Section 14.02) \nConcerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent \nWe, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.  The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture. \nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 Indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, and the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Chase’s indenture.  Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2016 Indenture, and the Issuer would be required to appoint a successor trustee.  For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving the Issuer default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded. \n# \nhe debt securities and the 2016 Indenture, including the guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws f the State of New York.

This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award, shares that vest under this award, and/or dividend equivalents, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award or dividend equivalents until you pay any taxes associated with the award, vested shares and/or the dividend equivalents directly to the competent authorities. \nRight to Set Off: Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below. \nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.

(See Sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment” and “Remedies”.) \nBinding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger o otherwise. \nNot a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining severance. \nSection 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares and cash hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following (i) each applicable vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award and (ii) each date that JPMorgan Chase specifies for payment of dividends declared on its Common Stock, shall be the payment date(s) for purposes of distributing dividend equivalent payments."

Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event. \nIf you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section.

Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.

You also will be required to repay the Fair Market Value of the number of shares (before tax and other withholdings) of Common Stock distributed to you that would have been outstanding as RSUs on the date you failed to satisfy the “Condition for Continued Vesting of Awards” but for their accelerated distribution (as described in the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”).

The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award. \nThis award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement.

However, vesting and the number of RSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision). \nUp to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk RSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors: \nYour performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.   \nFor any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.   \nAwards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.   \nThe Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold."

Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments. \nPayment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under th erms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty. \nNothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” and “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy Identified Staff”. \n# \nYou acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity. \n# \nWithholding Taxes: As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.

Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent.

No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled in whole or part.

Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).

The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event. \nIf you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section.  In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each applicable vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility”. \nUse of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled. \nGoverning Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles. \nChoice of Forum: By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum. \nWaiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims: By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or joint action. \nLitigation: By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm. \nNon-transferability: Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of RSUs, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm. \nOutstanding Awards: The Administrative provisions set forth above shall apply to any award of RSUs outstanding as of the dat hereof, and such awards are hereby amended. \n# \n“Cause” means a determination by the Firm that your employment terminated as a result of your (i) violation of any law, rule or regulation (including rules of self-regulatory bodies) related to the Firm’s business, (ii) indictment or conviction of a felony, (iii) commission of a fraudulent act, (iv) violation of the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct or other Firm policies or misconduct related to your duties to the Firm (other than immaterial and inadvertent violations or misconduct), (v) grossly inadequate performance of the duties associated with your position or job function or failure to follow reasonable directives of your manager, or (vi) any act or failure to act that is injurious to the interests of the Firm or its relationship with a customer, client or an employee."

The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award. \nThis award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date. \nCapitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as se orth in the Plan. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiarie as the “Firm”. \n# \nEach PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the vesting date as set forth in your Awar Agreement. \nhe purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders. \n# \nSubject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions: \nPerformance calculation:  On the vesting date, you will vest in a number of PSUs derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.  See sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”. \nYou will also vest in additional shares of Common Stock as calculated under the section captioned, “Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”.  Delivery of vested shares to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of the subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”. \n# \nIf dividends are paid on Common Stock during the Vesting Period while the award is outstanding, you will receive on the vesting date additional units representing shares of Common Stock as calculated in this section.  The number, if any, will be based on the dividends that would have been paid during the Vesting Period as of each dividend payment date on the actual number of shares of Common Stock distributable to you resulting from the vesting of the PSUs, if any, and treated as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock on each dividend payment based on the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on each dividend payment date (“Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”). \n# \nAs of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you shall be entitled to be issued a number of shares of the Common Stock of JPMorgan Chase equal to the number of PSUs, if any, plus any additional Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, vesting on such date, less the number withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  The net number of shares issued to you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for a two-year period commencing as of the vesting date and ending as of the second anniversary of the vesting date.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two-year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.

The Firm is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also “Administrative Provisions—No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”. \nIn addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows: \n• Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that: ◦ you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; ◦ you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations;” or ◦ you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government Office” following the termination of your employment.   \n• In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-ofrecovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate pursuant to the provisions in the section captioned “Recapture Provisions”. \nNotice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion. \nFor purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments. \nPayment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty. Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment”. \n# \nYou acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity. \n# \nWithholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities."

Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below. \nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if any, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Termination of Employment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.) \nWith respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment” and “Remedies”.) \nBinding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger o otherwise. \nNot a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining severance. \nSection 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first calendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award. \nChange in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events."

Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties. \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.

This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase. \nSeverability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law. \nAccelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, including Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, effective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event. \nIf you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned “Death”. \no the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture equirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required. \nNotwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of the vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “Full Career Eligibility”. \nUse of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).

Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award. \nThis award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date. \nCapitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as se orth in the Plan. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiarie as the “Firm”. \n# \nEach PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock following each vesting date as set forth in you Award Agreement. \nThe purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders. \n# \nSubject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions: \nPerformance calculation:  The number of PSUs at the end of the Performance Period will be derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table. \nThe number of PSUs determined above will be subject to the Qualitative Performance Factor (as detailed below), which if the Committee determines that such an adjustment is appropriate, will be applied following the end of each year during the Performance Period, to adjust downward one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each calendar year in the Performance Period. Additionally, the Committee, in its discretion, may make a qualitative performance assessment based on the entire three-year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined above. \nSee sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”. \nDelivery of vested shares of common stock to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of th subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”. \n# \nThis award is not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent share units. \n# \nThe net number of shares of Common Stock (after tax and all other lawful withholdings) in which you have vested, if any, as of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for (i) a twelve month period measured from each vesting date; and (ii) a two year period for such shares vesting on ____________, 20____, with the holding periods running concurrently. Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, “Death” and subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”."

        "text": "# \nFor purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance Period shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common Equity” (if otherwise applicable), “Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” (including its footnote) and “ROTCE” as set forth in the “Definitions” section of these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “Definitions”.  Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “Definitions--Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors. \n# \nnvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below a redetermined threshold of ______ $\\%$ . \nIf the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-thir of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year. \n# \nDetermination of Qualitative Performance Factor.  Annually during the Performance Period, the Committee will formally assess your qualitative performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls & Conduct; (3) Teamwork & Leadership; and (4) Business Results. If the Committee determines that your performance “Meets” expectations, no downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for that year shall take place (and the Qualitative Performance Factor shall be $100\\%$ ). If the Committee determines that your performance did “Not Meet” expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what extent.  A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between $0\\%$ and $99\\%$ , depending on the circumstances.  During the Performance Period, a $0\\%$ Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period would reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to zero, resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting. \nAdditionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on your performance during the entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined  under  section captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at End of the Performance Period”.  In the case of a Qualitative Performance Factor of $0\\%$ , the award would be cancelled. \nThe assessment will have regard to feedback solicited from the Chair of the UK Remuneration Committee to incorporate qualitativ performance against local regulatory responsibilities as a “Senior Manager” of the relevant CIB UK-regulated entities. \nThe Qualitative Performance Factor shall only be applied, if applicable, in respect of a period of your employment with the Firm, or a soon as administratively practical. \n# \nThis award is intended and expected to vest on each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at the end of Performance Period”, “Capital Ratio Performance Threshold”, “Recapture Provisions”, “Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision). \nUp to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you as of any vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors: \n• Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time. Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are: net income, total net revenue, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.   \n• For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.   \n• RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.   \n• The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold."

This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below. \nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if any, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.

Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award. \nChange in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. \nOther Equitable Adjustments: Except for the “Qualitative Performance Factor”, the Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate. \nInterpretation/Administration:  The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties. \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan."

This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase. \nSeverability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law. \nAccelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement or distribution date prior to any acceleration event. \nIf you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned “Death”. \nTo the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture equirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required. \nNotwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “Full Career Eligibility”. \nUse of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled. \nGoverning Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles. \nChoice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum. \nWaiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with you employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or joint action."
