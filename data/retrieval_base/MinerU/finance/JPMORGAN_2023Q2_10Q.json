        "text": "# \n• Basel III Finalization: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity\". Under the proposal, changes would include replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise riskbased capital requirements for all banks with assets of $\\$100$ billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\"). The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. \n• GSIB Surcharge: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 for additional information. \n# \nThese current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form 10-Q; Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K; and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209 of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. \nJPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. \nIn May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking recommending a special assessment related to the systemic risk determination made on March 12, 2023, to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (\"DIF\") arising from the protection of uninsured depositors resulting from recent bank resolutions. In its current form, the rule would impose a special assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points on certain banks’ estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022. If this rule is finalized as proposed, the Firm expects to recognize an estimated assessment expense of approximately $\\$3$ billion (pre-tax) in the quarter in which the rule is finalized, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2023. \n# \n• Management expects both net interest income and net interest income excluding Markets to be approximately $\\$87$ billion, market dependent. • Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $\\$84.5$ billion, market dependent and excluding any FDIC special assessment. Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be approximately $2.6\\%$ . \nNet interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures.

In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm issued a five-year, $\\$50$ billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"), and entered into shared-loss agreements with the FDIC with respect to certain loans acquired and lendingrelated commitments assumed in the acquisition. Refer to Note 28 for additional information. \nJPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2023 reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Where meaningful to the disclosure, the impact of the First Republic acquisition is disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-Q. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may change in future periods, including across the Firm's segments. \n# \nRefer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of material risk factors that could affect the Firm. These risk factors include potential impacts to the Firm associated with current market and economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions (including secondary effects of the war in Ukraine), any or all of which could result in additional market disruption, government actions (including with respect to monetary policies), ongoing impacts to global supply chains, and other geopolitical risks. \n# \nThe publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, sixmonth and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 (“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-month and sixmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be published on a \"synthetic\" basis, which will allow market participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBORlinked contracts through September 30, 2024. \nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Firm successfully converted predominantly all of its cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as part of initiatives by the principal central counterparties $(^{\\cdot\\cdot}\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{C}\\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{S}^{\\cdot\\cdot})$ to convert cleared derivatives prior to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm’s other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR Cessation will be remediated through contractual fallback provisions or through the framework provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”). The Firm continues its client outreach activities with respect to the limited amount of contracts that continue to reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar LIBOR in order to complete remediation by September 30, 2024. \nRefer to Business Developments on page 50 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for additional information."

        "text": "The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. \nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a definition of managed basis. \n# \nResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. \n# \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. \n# \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. \nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. \nForeign exchange risk   \nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89 for additional information. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business equity on page 51, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. \nRefer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies."

Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.

        "text": "Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. \n# \nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. \n# \n\nRefer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. \n# \nThe following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2022 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nRisk governance and oversight functions & page reference & Form10-QForm 10-K page reference \\\\\nStrategic Risk &  & 85 \\\\\nCapital Risk & 48-53 & 86-96 \\\\\nLiquidity Risk & 54-61 & 97-104 \\\\\nReputation Risk &  & 105 \\\\\nConsumer CreditRisk & 65-69 & 110-115 \\\\\nWholesaleCreditRisk & 70-79 & 116-126 \\\\\nInvestmentPortfolioRisk & 83 & 130 \\\\\nMarket Risk & 84-89 & 131-138 \\\\\nCountry Risk & 90 & 139-140 \\\\\nClimate Risk &  & 141 \\\\\nOperational Risk &  & 142-148 \\\\\nCompliance Risk &  & 145 \\\\\nConduct Risk &  & 146 \\\\\nLegal Risk &  & 147 \\\\\nEstimationsand ModelRisk &  & 148 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. \nRefer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10- K, Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s capital risk. \n# \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51 for additional information. \n# \n# \nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $\\$2.9$ billion CECL capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at $25\\%$ per year over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining $\\$1.4$ billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. \nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased out $50\\%$ of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance. \nRisk-based Capital Targets The Firm’s target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio for the first quarter of 2024 remains at $13.5\\%$ . The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from the target dependent on market conditions. The target is based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect. \n# \nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity\". Under the proposal, changes would include replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $\\$100$ billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. \n# \nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would revise riskbased capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer to Riskbased Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 89-90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the GSIB surcharge."

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets. \nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and marketmaking portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. \nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. \nThe decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022, and for the average three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year periods, was due to lower net issuance levels resulting from short-term liquidity management. \nThe decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year periods was due to a lower level of overdrafts as well as net maturities of structured notes classified as other borrowed funds in CIB."

        "text": "# \n# \nLoans increased compared to December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate loans associated with the First Republic acquisition and higher auto loans. \nResidential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. \nRetained loans increased compared to December 31, 2022, reflecting residential real estate loans associated with the First Republic acquisition. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared to December 31, 2022. Net recoveries were lower for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates. \nLoans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2022, driven by a decrease in CIB due to sales outpacing purchases largely offset by an increase in Home Lending as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual loans at fair value were relatively flat compared to December 31, 2022. \nAt June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $\\$90.0$ billion and $\\$36.3$ billion, respectively. The increase was driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio and there were no charge-offs associated with the First Republic acquisition. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $\\$16.9$ billion at June 30, 2023, which included $\\$2.6$ billion associated with the First Republic acquisition. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding included $\\$4.6$ billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $\\$4.7$ billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-forsale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(inmillions) & June30, 2023 & December31, 2022 \\\\\nCurrent &  & $t \\\\\n30-89dayspastdue & 112 & 136 \\\\\n90ormoredayspastdue & 215 & 302 \\\\\nTotalgovernmentguaranteedloans &  & 941$ 1,097 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n# \nAt June 30, 2023, $\\$23,456$ billion, or $70\\%$ of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, compared with $\\$147.8$ billion, or $62\\%$ at December 31, 2022. \nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate loans. \n# \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $\\$35$ million and $\\$75$ million, respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $\\$33$ million and $\\$48$ million of loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, as well as $\\$3$ million and $\\$5$ million of loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information. \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, residential real estate TDRs were $\\$115$ million and $\\$233$ million, respectively.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 72-75 for further information. \nThe Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 for additional information. \nAs of June 30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming exposure was driven by loans, resulting from client-specific downgrades in CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction in lending-related commitments.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 24 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. \nThe percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately $88\\%$ and $87\\%$ at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $\\$64.2$ billion and $\\$70.9$ billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by market movements in CIB Markets. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. \nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. \nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. \nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivatives transactions."

        "text": "The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally consists of: \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),   \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and   \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2023 was $\\$24.3$ billion, reflecting a net addition of $\\$2.7$ billion from December 31, 2022. \nThe net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $\\$1.5$ billion, consisting of: \n• $\\$819$ million in wholesale, predominantly driven by net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and   \n• $\\$649$ million in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. \nThe net addition also included $\\$1.2$ billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. \nThe Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting an increased probability of a moderate recession due to tightening financial conditions. \nThe allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $\\$587$ million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at $5.8\\%$ in the third quarter of 2024, and a $1.5\\%$ lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024. \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{AssumptionsatJune30,2023} \\\\\n & 4Q23 & 2Q24 & 4Q24 \\\\\nu.s.unemploymentrate (a) & 4.2 % & 4.9 % & 5.0 0% \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDp(b) & 0.5 % & - % & 1.0 % \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} \\\\\n & AssumptionsatDecember31,2022 2Q23 &  & 2Q24 \\\\\nu.S.unemployment rate (a) & 3.8 % & 4Q23 4.3 % & 5.0 % \\\\\nYoYgrowth in U.S.real GDp(b) & 1.5 % & 0.4 % & 一 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. \n# \nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $\\$610.2$ billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was $\\mathsf{A A+}$ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

        "text": "# \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. \n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits. \n\n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The model change incorporated observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income. Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information. \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n(in billions) & June30, 2023 & December31, 2022 \\\\\nParallelshift: \\\\\n+1o0bpsshiftinrates & 2.5 & $ (2.0) \\\\\n-100bpsshift inrates & (2.2) & 2.4 \\\\\nSteeperyieldcurve: \\\\\n+100bpsshiftinlong-termrates & 0.6 & 0.8 \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinshort-termrates & (1.6) & 3.2 \\\\\nFlatteryieldcurve: +10obpsshiftinshort-termrates & 1.8 & (2.8) \\\\\n-100bpsshiftinlong-termrates & (0.6) & (0.9) \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior periods have not been revised. \nIn the absence of the model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2023, would have been lower by $\\$4.2$ billion to the $+100$ basis points shift in shortterm and parallel rate scenarios and higher by $\\$4.4$ billion to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios. \nIn addition, the change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet including the impact of the First Republic acquisition. \nAs of June 30, 2023, the Firm’s sensitivity to the $+/-100$ basis points parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing."

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally consists of: \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated).   \n• The allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and   \nThe allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82 and Note 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. \n\n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment and HPI.   \n• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI. \nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. \nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic Portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real estate that has more commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 80 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately $1.6\\%$ higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of $2.2\\%$ in the first quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining approximately $3.1\\%$ lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately $3.4\\%$ in the third quarter of 2024; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately $10.5\\%$ in the first quarter of 2025."

        "text": "This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: \n• The allowance as of June 30, 2023, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.   \n• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. \nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: \n• An increase of approximately $\\$750$ million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments, including the First Republic portfolios   \n• An increase of approximately $\\$2.4$ billion for credit card loans   \n▪ An increase of approximately $\\$3.8$ billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments, excluding the First Republic portfolios. \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. \nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2023. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. \nAssets measured at fair value   \nThe following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nJune30,2023 (in millions, except ratios) & Total assets at fair value & Total level 3 assets \\\\\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements Securities borrowed & $322,579 55,905 & $ \\\\\nTrading assets: Trading-debt and equity instruments & 572,739 & 3,313 \\\\\nDerivative receivables(a) & 64,217 & 10,749 \\\\\nTotal trading assets AFS securities & 636,956 203,262 & 14,062 267 \\\\\nLoans MSRS & 38,789 8,229 & 3,808 \\\\\nOther Total assets measured at fair value on & 13,250 & 8,229 417 \\\\\na recurring basis Total assets measured at fair value on a & 1,278,970 & 26,783 \\\\\nnonrecurringbasis & 1,936 & 1,126 \\\\\nTotal assets measured at fair value & $1,280,906 & $27,909 \\\\\nTotalFirm assets & $3,868,240 \\\\\nLevel3 assets at fair value as a \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n &  & 0.7 % \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\nLevel3assetsatfairvalueasa \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\npercentage of total Firm assets at fair \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\n \\\\\nvalue(a) &  & 2.2 % \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $\\$10.7$ billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset.

        "text": "# \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \n# \nThe credit card rewards liability was $\\$12.2$ billion and $\\$11.3$ billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter. Refer to pages 151-152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. \n# \nRefer to Income taxes on page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. \n# \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment.

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may change in future periods including across the Firm's segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. \nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. \nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation. \n# \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. \nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. \n# \nThe adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. \nRefer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information. \n# \nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post"

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach. \nThis guidance was adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\\$587$ million and an increase to retained earnings of $\\$446$ million, after-tax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. \nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will differ from those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year. \nRefer to Note 12 for further information."

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented."

        "text": "(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).   \n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $\\$956$ million and $\\$950$ million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $\\$40$ million and $\\$43$ million, respectively, and other assets of $\\$916$ million and $\\$907$ million, respectively.   \n(e) At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $\\$9.3$ billion and $\\$9.7$ billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $\\$6.8$ billion of commercial first-lien mortgages for both periods. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $\\$3.3$ billion and $\\$2.4$ billion, respectively.   \n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. \n# \nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date."

When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments."

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. On June 29, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5991 to 1.5902 effective June 28, 2023. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. \nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions."

Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipalprotected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note.

Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. \nIn the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. \nThe Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. \nThe Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. \nTerms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses."

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. \nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: \n• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the dat presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and   \n• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.   \n(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.   \n(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty.   \n(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.   \n(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $\\$52.5$ billion and $\\$51.5$ billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. \n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $\\$(30)$ million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $\\$(865)$ million at June 30, 2023.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-thaninsignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $\\$35$ million and $\\$75$ million, respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were largely in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weightedaverage life of the loans by 15 years and 18 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from $6.90\\%$ to $4.21\\%$ and $6.75\\%$ to $4.01\\%$ for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $\\$33$ million and $\\$48$ million of loans subject to a trial modification, and $\\$3$ million and $\\$5$ million of Chapter 7 loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. \nFor periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new TDRs were $\\$115$ million and $\\$233$ million, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on TDRs. \nNature and extent of modifications The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs during the period presented. \n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & Threemonths endedJune30, & Sixmonthsended June 30, \\\\\n & 2022 & 2022 \\\\\nNumberofloansapprovedfora trialmodification & 1,165 & 2,691 \\\\\nNumber ofloanspermanently modified & 1,289 & 2,831 \\\\\nConcession granted:(a) \\\\\nInterestratereduction & 45 % & 56 % \\\\\nTermorpaymentextension & 54 & 67 \\\\\nPrincipaland/orinterest deferred & 10 & 12 \\\\\nPrincipalforgiveness & 1 & 1 \\\\\nOther(b) & 46 & 36 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified.

If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. \nThe Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. \nThis guidance was adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\\$587$ million and an increase to retained earnings of $\\$446$ million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. \nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies."

Refer to Note 1 for further information. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios.

A third party is typically the general partner or managing \nmember and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\\$32.4$ billion and $\\$30.2$ billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of which $\\$12.6$ billion and $\\$10.6$ billion was unfunded at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for more information on offbalance sheet lending-related commitments."

        "text": "Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. \nIn those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the \npower to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $\\$5.9$ billion and $\\$5.8$ billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $\\$8.2$ billion. \n# \nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. \n# \nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization. \n\\begin{tabular}{llllllllllllll}\n & \\multicolumn{6}{l}{ThreemonthsendedJune30,} & \\multicolumn{6}{l}{SixmonthsendedJune30,} \\\\\n & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{2023} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2022} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2023} & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{2022} \\\\\n(in millions) & Residential mortgage(d) &  & Commercial and other(e) &  & Residential mortgage(d) &  & Commercial and other(e) & Residential mortgage(d) & Commercial and other(e) &  & Residential mortgage(d) &  & Commercial and other(e) \\\\\nPrincipalsecuritized Allcashflowsduringthe & $ & 2,216 & 376 & $ & 3,028 &  & 3,950 & 3,289 & 376 & $ & 9,523 & $ & 7,058 \\\\\nperiod:(a) Proceedsreceivedfrom loansalesas.financial \\\\\ninstruments(b)(c) Servicingfeescollected & $ & 2,123 $ 6 &  & 380 1 &  & 2,754 $ 20 & 3,869 & $ & 3,153 $ 12 & 380 1 & $ & 9,129 $ 44 & 6,975 \\\\\nCashflowsreceivedon \\\\\ninterests &  & 86 &  & 91 &  & 127 & 54 &  & 160 & 178 &  & 282 & 125 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs."

Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2023, or December 31, 2022, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022."

        "text": "# \nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.

In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements."

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were $5.02\\%$ and $4.89\\%$ as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. \nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower."

If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs."

        "text": "# \n# \nAs of June 30, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. \nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $\\$0$ to approximately $\\$1.3$ billion at June 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \nthe number, variety and varying stages of the   \nproceedings, including the fact that many are in   \npreliminary stages,   \nthe existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,   \nthe numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class   \ncertification and the scope of many of the claims, and the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. \n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $\\$300$ million and $\\$500$ million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, which the Court took under consideration. \nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $\\$31.5$ million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $\\$25$ million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)"

        "text": "through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. \nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. \nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $\\$900$ million to the approximately $\\$5.3$ billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s approval of the settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for rehearing of the Appellate Court’s approval. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\\$700$ million has been returned to the \ndefendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. \nOf the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately $65\\%$ of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. \nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, was a putative class action filed by an alleged sextrafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. In March 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s motions to dismiss these complaints, allowing some claims to proceed in both lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm’s former employee, James Edward Staley, into the two lawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant doctrine. In May 2023, the Court denied Staley’s motion to dismiss the impleader complaints. In June 2023, the Court granted the putative class’ motion for class certification and granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will pay $\\$290$ million to a fund for Epstein survivors. The actions involving the government of the United States Virgin Islands and Staley are proceeding. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending."

        "text": "In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. \nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants have opposed. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle this action, subject to final documentation and court approval. \nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. \nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. \n\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. \nTwo shareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June 2023, respectively, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to exercise adequate oversight with respect to the Firm’s provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These actions allege that the shareholders are excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. These actions were consolidated and defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. \n\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. \nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $\\$420$ million and $\\$73$ million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future."

        "text": "In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period."

        "text": "# \nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver, for $\\$67.9$ billion, resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of $\\$2.7$ billion recorded in other income. The estimated bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. The First Republic acquisition further advances the Firm's wealth management strategy and is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. \nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. \nThe Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the settlement process under which the purchase price, and the identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date. \nIn addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending management's finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (such as loans and commitments, intangible assets and leases), which may take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. \nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers $80\\%$ of credit losses, on a pari-passu basis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers $80\\%$ of credit losses, on a pari-passu basis, for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA are reflected in the total assets acquired. \nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a five-year, $\\$50$ billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of $3.4\\%$ and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the FDIC. \nThe Firm had placed a $\\$5$ billion deposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $\\$30$ billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $\\$5$ billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $\\$25$ billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023."

(c) Other assets include $\\$1.2$ billion in tax-oriented investments and $\\$756$ million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $\\$669$ million and lease liabilities of $\\$756$ million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 17 for additional information. \nThe issuance of the $\\$50$ billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $\\$5$ billion deposit and $\\$447$ million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $\\$3.7$ billion payable to the FDIC as part of the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions. \nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. \nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies for securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments. \n# \nCore deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic transaction. The core deposit intangible of $\\$1.3$ billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $\\$187$ million were valued by discounting estimated aftertax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying values of the core deposit and customer relationship intangibles were $\\$1.2$ billion and $\\$183$ million, respectively, reflecting accumulated amortization of approximately $\\$30$ million and $\\$4$ million, respectively. \n\n# \nThe indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses."

        "text": "The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets will be based on changes in amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared loss assets and will be recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration. \n# \nThe Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. \nThe FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt.

The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers."

        "text": "PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority \nPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. \nPrincipal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven marketmaking activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified riskmanagement activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. \nPSU(s): Performance share units \nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. \nREO: Real estate owned \nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. \nRetained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e.   \nexcludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). \nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. \nS&P: Standard and Poors \nSA-CCR: Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk \nSAR as it pertains to Hong Kong: Special Administrative Region \nSAR(s) as it pertains to employee stock awards: Stock appreciation rights \nSCB: Stress capital buffer \nScored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans to individuals and certain small business loans. \nSEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \nSecuritized Products Group: Comprised of Securitized Products and tax-oriented investments. \nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment. \nShelf securities: Securities registered with the SEC under a shelf registration statement that have not been issued, offered or sold. These securities are not included in league tables until they have actually been issued. \nSingle-name: Single reference-entities \nSLR: Supplementary leverage ratio \nSOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate \nSPEs: Special purpose entities \nStructural interest rate risk: represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm. \nStructured notes: Structured notes are financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, underlying reference pool of loans or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing"

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top $10\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4- star rating represents the next $22.5\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next $35\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next $22.5\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom $10\\%$ of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results."

Controls and Procedures. \nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. \nThe Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 155 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10- K for further information. \nOn May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC. The Firm has included internal controls over these acquired assets and assumed liabilities in its evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures. Otherwise, there was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting. \n# \n# \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal proceedings in Note 26 of this Form 10-Q for information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. \n# \nThe following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K and Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form 10-Q. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. \n# \nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the “First Republic acquisition”). There can be no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the anticipated positive results, including with respect to: \n• the total cost of integration • the time required to complete the integration • the amount of longer-term cost savings • the overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or • an improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock. \nIntegration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the First Republic acquisition and its integration efforts. \nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause clients and customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key employees in connection with the First Republic acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to successfully conduct its business. \n# \nRefer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 4–8 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for information on Supervision and Regulation. \n# \nThe Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity securities during the three months ended June 30, 2023. \nRepurchases under the common share repurchase program Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of this Form 10-Q and pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the Firm’s common share repurchase program. \nThe Firm is authorized to purchase up to $\\$30$ billion under its common share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors."
