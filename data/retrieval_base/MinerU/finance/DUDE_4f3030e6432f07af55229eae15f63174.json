Two issues namely imposition of Value Added Tax (VAT) and Graphic Health Warnings (GHW) on cigarette packets dominated the year and made the markets remain in a turbulent state. \n# \nOn 1st April, 2007, VAT on cigarettes was imposed for the first time in most markets where your Company operates. VAT being ad valorem in nature, is imposed on the invoice price and had an impact of $12.5\\%$ in the price to the consumer. This coupled with an for reporting. Geographical segments considered for disclosure mainly consist of sales within India and sales outside India. The entire activity pertaining to sales outside India is carried out from India. \n\n# \nincrease of $6\\%$ (inclusive of cess) in Excise Duties in the Union Budget 2007 resulted in increase of cigarette prices by more than $22\\%$ . It was expected that the industry would shrink in the current year as this rise was unprecedented in the cigarette industry. GHW has been the other issue which remained in news throughout the year. Originally scheduled for implementation during February, 2007, it was postponed a number of times during the year and the current revised date is June 2008. This uncertainty of the GHW being implemented resulted in creating uncertain market conditions through the year. \n# \nIn spite of the twin challenges mentioned above, your Company was able to grow volumes by $1\\%$ during the current financial year. More heartening, was the change in mix with filters share improving substantially. The value for money filter brand \"Moments\" was launched during the last quarter of the year 2006-07 and continues to show promise. It is also pertinent to add that brands launched during the last five years, namely Special Extra Smooth, Moments, Shaan, etc. have continued to show great promise and currently their share in the total volume is around $20\\%$ . \nYour Company considers tobacco and related products as the primary segment \nThe improved economic conditions as well as your Company's strategic thrust in concentrating on the tobacco business, have helped your Company to continue on the growth path despite great adversities. \nThe current Union Budget 2008-09 has dealt yet another unprecedented blow to the cigarette industry as a whole and has much more significant adverse effect on your Company in particular. The excise duty for non-filter cigarettes has been increased by two and a half times to five times, a selective increase not seen in the history of the cigarette industry. Upto length of $60\\mathrm{mm}$ brands the duty has been increased from Rs.168 per 1000 cigarettes to $_{\\mathsf{R s}.819}$ per 1000 cigarettes, nearly 5 times.

On the other hand, Excise Duty rates for the entire filter segment, accounting for $70\\%$ of industry volume remain unchanged. \nYou are aware these two plain segments constitute around $55\\%$ of your Company's market and such record increases can only create significant competitive disadvantages for us in the market place. As this move by the Government is selectively punitive, representations have been made to the Finance Ministry in New Delhi and also been taken up by the industry to moderate duty increases. Nevertheless, your Company has responded to such challenges in the past and is confident that it will overcome the current crises. For the industry however, this translates to impact of $30\\%$ on volumes and it would be fair to estimate that there would be substantial reduction in volumes in these two segments, as to render them virtually insignificant. \nDuring the year under review the cigarette volumes grew from $8653~\\mathsf{m n s}$ in 2006-07 to 8823 mns in 2007-08. The value realizations were also higher at $\\mathsf{R s}.709.94$ crore up from Rs.674.98 crore in the previous year. \n# \nWe are happy to report that your Company has recorded Rs.59.55 crore leaf export turnover, which is $32\\%$ higher than the year 2006-07, despite severe competition and rupee appreciation. \nYour Company has established special tobaccos for niche markets, which are being produced by the large farmer base of your Company.

The said prayer was not approved by the Court. TCFI filed another application seeking directions for all the tobacco companies to adopt harm reduction strategy to curb tobacco consumption instead of seeking an outright ban of cigarettes. On 9th January, 2008, at the request of TCFI itself, the Delhi High court dismissed the petition as withdrawn."

High Court by its Order dated 30th December, 1996. However, certain amounts due to your Company remained with ITCATF. \nYour Company had also nominated two of its employees as directors on the Board of ITCATF to look after the investments and seek their recovery. Subsequently, ITCATF went into losses and eventually a winding up petition was instituted. The Andhra Pradesh High Court, by an Order dated $28\\mathrm{{th}}$ June, 2001 directed winding up of ITCATF and appointed the Official Liquidator (OL) as its Liquidator to take necessary steps.

Discharge petitions have been filed by all five ex-Directors of ITCATF and their trial commenced. Meanwhile, one of the ex-Directors has filed the Statement of Affairs in the prescribed format. \nBy order dated 28th February, 2006, the Hon'ble A.P. High Court had directed investigation into the matter to find out the whereabouts of records and documents. Your Company along with ITC filed an Appeal against this order and the Division Bench was pleased to grant stay of the said Order.

This investigation is still in progress. \n\nIn the meantime, one of the ex-Directors of ITCATF filed an application for the Court to summon original documents and also to recall the OL for cross examination. This was dismissed by a single judge of the Hon'ble A.P. High Court by its Order dated 27th September, 2006. Against this an Appeal was filed before the Division Bench who, by Order dated 12th February, 2007, were pleased to grant stay of proceedings until further orders.

        "text": "For the first time, the tobacco industry has been told to print the prescribed graphic health warnings on all its product packing. The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging & Labelling) Rules, 2006 had originally prescribed pictorial warnings along with health messages and sign of skull and cross bones. However, due to vociferous objections from various sections of the industry and public, a Committee of a Group of Ministers was constituted to relook at the warnings. Based on their recommendations, a new set of labelling requirements have been prescribed under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2008 which were published on 16th March, 2008. These revised labelling requirements have to be implemented within three months from the date of notification, which is yet to be published. Your Company is once again taking various steps to comply with the revised labelling requirements which will involve considerable amount of investment in addition to the amount already spent, to develop the required printing technology and also to redesign all the packaging in accordance with the labelling rules. \n\n# \nUnder the provisions of Section 217 (2A) of the Companies Act, 1956, read with the Companies (Particulars of Employees) Rules, 1975 as amended, the particulars of employees are set out in annexure to this Report. \nYour Directors take this opportunity to record their deep appreciation of the continuous support and contribution from all employees in your Company. \n# \nThe Auditors, Messrs. Lovelock & Lewes, Chartered Accountants, retire at the ensuing Annual General Meeting and being eligible, offer themselves for reappointment. \n# \nThe severe blow dealt by the Union Budget has raised significant & unprecedented challenges on your Company. \n\nThe focus of your Company will continue to remain on cigarettes with greater thrust on improving market share in both existing as well as new geographies. Efforts would be made to improve the share of filters in the total portfolio. Despite the plain and micro segment markets being currently in severe disruption, the Company is hopeful of mitigating the current difficult conditions as much as possible. Your Company is also committed to improving the export turnover of unmanufactured tobacco with thrust on new crop varieties. \nOn behalf of the Board, \nA. BASU Chairman \nDated this 17th day of April, 2008. Azamabad, Hyderabad - 500 020, Andhra Pradesh."
