        "text": "# \nYour Directors submit their Report for the financial year ended 31st March, 2005. \n# \nAdvance estimates of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) for 2004-05 indicate a real GDP growth of $6.9\\%$ – well above the expectations at the commencement of the year. This growth has been achieved despite a less than normal monsoon, decline in the kharif crop output, unprecedented rise in global oil prices and fears of degrowth in outsourced IT services from India. The decline in kharif foodgrains consequent to the shortfall in south west monsoon is expected to be offset by improved rabi output, which is estimated to exceed kharif production for the first time since 1950-51. The potentially inflationary impact of rising world crude prices has so far been ameliorated through a combination of agile fiscal policy and prudent monetary management. Growth in the Indian IT sector has continued unabated, with software export earnings touching USD 30 billion. \nThe smart upturn of $8.8\\%$ in the manufacturing sector led the growth momentum during the year, resulting in a growth of $8.1\\%$ in the Index of Industrial Production till February 2005. The doubledigit growth of consumer non-durables is a healthy sign of recovery in this segment. Manufactured goods also led the nation’s export effort for the year. In an environment where global GDP growth of $5\\%$ for 2004 was the highest in the last three decades, India’s overall exports grew by $24\\%$ to touch USD 80 billion. \nThe above-the-trend GDP growth in the last two successive years were founded on a welcome growth in investments, led by the private sector. The investment rate of $26.3\\%$ of GDP in 2003-04 was the highest since the mid-nineties. This trend continued during 2004-05, with incremental creditdeposit ratio exceeding $100\\%$ for the first time in 15 years.  A buoyant investment sentiment coupled with prospects of a normal monsoon in 2005 has led to widespread expectations of GDP growth in the region of $7\\%$ for 2005-06. \nEconomic growth does not necessarily translate to sustainable development. The manner of industrial growth so far has taken an immeasurable toll on finite natural resources, and yet left vast numbers of people in poverty. On the one hand, depletion of biodiversity resources – soil, water, air – has increased the fragility of ecological balance manifold. On the other, the declining rate of growth of agriculture has led to the present situation where nearly $60\\%$ of India’s population shares barely $22\\%$ of its output. Over $75\\%$ of those below the poverty line reside in rural India. Poverty manifests itself not only as material impoverishment but also in the lack of real opportunities for the poor to emerge from such a condition. Such fundamental deprivations of freedom suffered by individuals who are casualties of high morbidity and illiteracy affects their economic performance as well as their ability to seize opportunities offered by expanding markets. Growth agendas can become sustainable only if they include in their wake strategies to enhance ecological and social capital, thereby translating to development. \n\nThe promise of a ‘New Deal’ for rural India, the Government’s ‘Bharat Nirman’ proposal involving an investment outlay of over Rs.174000 crores during the next 4 years (2005-2009) towards creating rural infrastructure, and the emphasis on effective delivery mechanisms represent key policy focus areas towards securing sustainable development. Such policy initiatives need to be supplemented with reforms in the agricultural sector, founded upon effective connectivity to markets, improved productivity of resources and enhanced value addition. A comprehensive growth strategy for rural India, including the agri sector, is necessary to address the serious issues relating to sustainability and to enlarge effective domestic demand by including those living at the margin in the process of market development. \nImplementation of reforms has assumed even greater urgency in view of the escalating challenges to competitiveness of the various sectors of the economy. The recent slew of Free Trade Agreements at bilateral and regional levels and the consequent calibrated demolition of cross border tariffs would translate to opportunities only if the economy and its constituents can make a successful transition towards global competitiveness. Increasing domestic competitiveness, together with enlarged aggregate domestic demand, can then become the foundation for much higher levels of investment and employment.

        "text": "$26.3\\%$ is well below that of China, which sustains a level of $45\\%$ of GDP. For India’s oft quoted advantage of demographics to become a driver of growth, about 10 million new jobs need to be created annually over the next decade. Publicprivate partnerships in investment are critical to realise such outcomes, particularly in generating off-farm employment and absorbing displacement of labour inherent in agricultural reform. \nIn line with this rationale, your Company is engaged in enlarging its contribution across three dimensions – economic, ecological and social – through investments in all its businesses and across the value chain, where feasible. Your Company believes that it has earned the right to make an enlarged contribution on the basis of its ability to create superior economic value. Highlights of your Company’s progress are discussed in the sections that follow. \n# \nYour Company posted yet another year of stellar performance, testifying to the robustness of the corporate strategy of pursuing multiple drivers of growth. The performance is even more heartening when viewed in the context of the challenging environment of the cigarette industry, impact of the absorption of incubation costs of the new business initiatives and the gestation cost of new investments in the hotels and paperboards businesses. \nGross Turnover for the year 2004-05 grew by $13\\%$ to Rs.13350 crores, driven by good topline growth across all businesses of your Company. Pretax profit (before exceptional items) increased by $15.3\\%$ to Rs.2673 crores, while Post-tax profit (before exceptional items) at Rs.1837 crores registered a growth of $15.3\\%$ . The financials for the year include Rs.692 crores representing net income from exceptional items, most of which relate to past litigation. Inclusive of these exceptional items net of tax, your Company’s Profit after Tax stands at Rs.2191 crores. \nEarnings Per Share (before exceptional items) for the year stands at Rs.73.74. Cash flows from Operations were Rs.2635 crores during the year. The financial results for the year ended 31st March, \n2005 include those of the erstwhile ITC Hotels Limited and Ansal Hotels Limited which were amalgamated with your Company with effect from 1st April, 2004. \nIn order to strike a balance between the need to sustain strategic investments for a secure future and the annual expectation of shareholders for growing income, your Directors are pleased to recommend a dividend of Rs.31.00 per share (previous year Rs.20.00 per share) for the year ended 31st March, 2005. The cash outflow in this regard will be Rs.881.70 crores (previous year Rs.560.10 crores) including Dividend Tax of Rs.108.45 crores (previous year Rs.64.74 crores). Your Board further recommends a transfer to General Reserve of Rs.1100 crores (previous year Rs.1000 crores). Consequently, your Board recommends leaving an unappropriated balance in the Profit and Loss Account of Rs.611.41 crores (previous year Rs.387.84 crores). \nProposed dividend for the financial year ended 31st March, 2005 includes dividend payable on the new Ordinary Shares of the Company, issued and allotted to the shareholders of erstwhile ITC Hotels Limited and Ansal Hotels Limited, which rank pari passu in all respects with the Ordinary Shares of the Company, in accordance with the Scheme of Amalgamation of ITC Hotels Limited and Ansal Hotels Limited with the Company. \n# \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{} & (Rs. in crores) \\\\\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Exceptional Items} & a) Profit Before Taxation and & 2005 & 2004 \\\\\n &  & 2673.07 & 2319.06 \\\\\n & Income Tax & 836.00 & 726.21 \\\\\nC) & ProfitAfterTaxationBefore Exceptional Items & 1837.07 & 1592.85 \\\\\nd) & Exceptional Items (net of tax) & 354.33 \\\\\ne) & Profit After Tax & 2191.40 & 1592.85 \\\\\nf) & Add : Profit brought forward from previous year & 387.84 & 343.88 \\\\\n & Transfer from Hotel Foreign Exchange Earnings Reserve Less : Transfer to Hotel Foreign Exchange & 15.14 & 4.00 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Earnings Reserve h) Surplus available for Appropriation} &  & 5.00 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}"

Earnings from agri exports is an indicator of your Company’s contribution to the rural economy through effectively linking small farmers with international markets. \nDuring the financial year 2004-05, your Company, its subsidiaries and the ITC Welcomgroup hotel chain together earned Rs.1378 crores in foreign exchange. Direct foreign exchange earned by your Company amounted to Rs.1269 crores. Your Company’s expenditure in foreign currency amounted to Rs.655 crores, comprising purchase of raw materials, spares and other expenses at Rs. 531 crores, and import of capital goods at Rs.124 crores. \nDetails of foreign exchange earnings and outgo are provided in Schedule 19 to the Accounts. \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS \n# \n# \nThe year under review witnessed a number of landmark developments in the Indian cigarette industry. On the regulatory front, severe restrictions were imposed on the industry with respect to advertising, sale and consumption of tobacco products with the implementation of the “Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003” (COTPA) with effect from 1st May, 2004. Further, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, of which India is one of the first signatories, was ratified on 27th February, 2005. The industry and Company’s stand on the unconstitutionality of State Luxury taxes on cigarettes was upheld by the Supreme Court. However, cigarettes continue to be subjected to a multiplicity of taxes at the Central and State levels. The industry believes that the levy of State-level taxes on cigarettes tantamounts to an infringement of the agreement between the Centre and the States reached at the National Development Council meeting of 1955 which substituted Statelevel taxes on cigarettes with Additional Excise Duty, levied by the Centre, but distributed amongst the States. In the context of Value Added Tax (VAT), the amendment to the Additional Excise Duty Act by the Finance Act 2003 cognises for the deleterious effect of cascading taxes by prescribing ‘transaction value’ as the basis for a $4\\%$ levy. In view of the highly taxed nature of the product, and the sensitivity to varying tax rates, ideally a single point levy on cigarettes through the existing specific duty mechanism of Central Excise would best serve the key canons of taxation, namely buoyancy, simplicity, certainty and efficiency in collection. Moreover, the intended objective behind VAT of creating a large unified market would only be realised if VAT replaces all other State-level taxes. \nAt the central level, after a relatively stable regime of taxation since February 2001, excise duty rates were hiked in March 2005, by as much as $10\\%$ for cigarettes and most other tobacco products. However, the increase in excise rates, sought to be justified on health grounds, excludes bidis, which outsell cigarettes more than 8 times. In view of the already existing high excise burden on cigarettes, this sharp increase in rates will significantly disadvantage cigarettes vis- $\\grave{\\mathsf{a}}$ -vis other tobacco products. The operating landscape for cigarettes, therefore, continues to be one of ever increasing challenges."

        "text": "Despite contributing more than $85\\%$ of tax revenues from tobacco, today cigarettes constitute only $14\\%$ of total tobacco consumed in the country, down from about $21\\%$ in 1981-82. In fact, as per latest available published data, while it is evident that on a per capita basis, annual adult tobacco consumption in India is close to $70\\%$ of the world average, cigarette consumption ranks amongst the lowest in the world. \nPer Capita Adult Tobacco Consumption (Kgs.) ,\n\nSource: Based on Cigarette consumption data (2003) from “World Cigarettes”, ERC Group Plc. \nIn India the taxes on cigarettes are about 30 times higher than those on other tobacco products, on a per kg basis. This heavy burden of tax has led to a progressive shift of tobacco consumption from the cigarette form to other forms resulting in loss of opportunity to maximise revenue from the tobacco sector. As cigarettes become more and more expensive due to increasing levels of taxation, tobacco consumption migrates to cheaper and revenue inefficient tobacco products. Since the incidence of tax on other tobacco products like bidis, gutkas and chewing tobacco is much lower than that on cigarettes and since these are manufactured pre-dominantly in the unorganised sector, revenue collection from these products remains comparatively insignificant due to leakages and inefficiencies. Fiscal legislation, over time, has thus led to the unintended consequence of suboptimisation of economic value per unit of tobacco consumption. \n\nIt is evident that high rates of taxes on cigarettes have neither imparted buoyancy to tax revenues from the tobacco sector nor curtailed overall consumption. It is now a well established principle that sustainable tax buoyancy can be realised only by expanding the tax base. This principle stands reinforced by the experience of China where, despite their per capita incomes being twice as much as India’s, rates of taxes on cigarettes are much lower than those in India, resulting in the tobacco sector generating as much as 10 times the revenue collection from the Indian cigarette industry. Unfortunately, in India the tax policy has been focussed hitherto on the minority segment of tobacco, i.e., cigarettes. The inevitable consequence of this has been sub-optimal revenue generation from tobacco. The need of the hour, therefore, is to reduce the difference in effective tax rates across classes of tobacco products in a manner that maximises contribution to the Exchequer from the tobacco sector even in a shrinking basket of overall tobacco consumption. This need for expansion of the tax base has now also been acknowledged by the Central Government: “Extend the ambit of tobacco product taxation, to hitherto untaxed or lightly taxed products such as beedis and chewed tobacco products, and bring their taxes on par with those on cigarettes….” Source: “Report on Tobacco Control in India”, Ministry of Health – 2004. \nWidening the tax base through moderation in rates can arrest the shift in tobacco consumption to revenue inefficient products."
