        "text": "# \n# \nstrong republic needs a strong power sector to anchor the growth  and development of the nation.  The passage of Republic Act No. 9136, which served as the economic blueprint for the restructuring of the electric power industry, was envisioned to provide a solid base for the introduction of the much needed reforms in the power sector. \nWhile the implementation of this law requires the concerted efforts of all industry stakeholders, ERC plays the most pivotal role in realizing its success. \nDuring the transition phase of the reform process, the Regulatory Body laid the groundworks for the electric industry restructuring.  For one, in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions, the Regulator has promulgated certain rules and regulations, guidelines and procedures which are vital to the restructuring of the power sector. \n\nWhile performing its rule-making function, the Commission is also mandated to hear cases involving unbundling of rates or otherwise, in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function.  In this respect, the Commission conducted an average of 3 to 4 hearings a day for year 2002. \nOn top of these functions, ERC is likewise tasked to enforce its orders and decisions, monitor their compliance, and accordingly impose the corresponding punitive sanctions in the exercise of its administrative enforcement function. \nConsidering the enormity of the work of the Regulator and the statutorily prescribed timelines that it has to meet, the greatest challenge it has continuously grappled with is balancing the interests of the consumers and the utility investors. \nIn issuing its Decisions on the rates unbundling of NPC Main, NPC-Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG) and four (4) electric cooperatives for the year 2002, ERC modified some of the previous rulings of its predecessor agencies by setting new key regulatory policies to further the promotion of public interest. \nCalendar Year 2002 was indeed a year of moulding and re-shaping the regulatory environment that is responsive to the needs of the electric power industry.  This task of the Regulatory Commission is not yet done though.  In the next two years, the foundations of the industry restructuring will continuously be built, until such time that the electricity market is ready, and retail competition and open access shall have already taken place. \nThe years ahead will definitely be full of challenges, and we are counting on the electricity stakeholders to do their share in meeting these challenges head-on."

Materials and supplies are necessary to the provision of reliable electricity service even if not physically in service. This is so because without immediate access to equipment held in inventory, an electric utility may have to wait for an unacceptable period of time for delivery of the assets necessary to correct an outage. Construction Work in Progress is a continuous process for NPC and was included so as not to discourage reasonable and necessary investment. \n\nExpenses disallowed by the Commission amounted to more than P8 billion primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization, and purchased power. Depreciation expense based on revalued assets was disallowed because it allowed said utility to recoup or amortize more than its original price investment. This effectively forced the customers to finance the increment between original and replacement cost. Such being the case, investors should only be allowed depreciation expense based on original cost. \nThe Commission adopted the “used and useful” standard in allowing or disallowing plants and assets in NPC’s rate base."

Both unbundling and consumer complaint cases translate to $80\\%$ of the cases heard. The rest accounts for the remaining $20\\%$ (refer to table 2). \nOut of the twenty-eight (28) cases decided, five (5) were on the application of unbundling of electricity rates by electric utilities (NPC- Main, PELCO I, PANELCO I, SORECO I, and ZAMSURECO II) filed in compliance with Section 36 of R.A. 9136.  In the case of the application for rate unbundling of NPC-SPUG, the Commission issued a Provisional Authority (PA); hence an Order, not a Decision was issued. \nFive (5) cases involved a petition for a rate increase. The Provisional Authority previously issued to Lanao del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (LANECO) and Negros Occidental Electric Cooperative, Inc. (NOCECO) were made permanent.  The rate of the Don Orestes Romualdez Electric Cooperative, Inc. was, however, maintained to its existing level. In addition, a Provisional Authority was issued to Sorsogon II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SORECO II) and Tarlac I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (TARELCO I). \nTo improve the provision for electricity services, the Commission approved the application of MERALCO (2 applications), Visayan Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Ibaan Electric and Engineering Corp. to build, install, operate, and/or increase the capacities of generation/distribution facilities.  A CPCN was also issued to MERALCO, extending for another 25 years its authority to operate in Cabuyao, Laguna.  Moreover, separate CPCNs were issued to the said utility for its operation of electric service in Obando and Sta.

A fine was imposed on two violations to Section 8 & 16 of ERB Resolution No. 95-21.  The third case, a violation of Section 16 of ERB Resolution No. 95-21, was dismissed after noting that the utility firm only failed to report the corrective action to make its distribution equipment and facilities in Maragondon and Magallanes, Cavite complying to standards set forth in the above cited resolution.
