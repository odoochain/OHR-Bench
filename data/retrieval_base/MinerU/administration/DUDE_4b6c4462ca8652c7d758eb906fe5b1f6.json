Reference is made to letters sent to the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Justice, Commerce, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Central Intelligence Agency by the Secretary of Defense on 14 July 1948, which stated in substance that the Secretary of Canmerce had sugsested that the Military Establishment call a meeting of representatives of the foregoing Departments and agencies with view to studying the problams. and details concerning the clandestine use of aircraft. The letters further stated that the undersigned would act as chairman of such meetings. \n2. The undersigned called meeting of the foregoing representatives, at which the problem &s a whole. was studied and various facets of the problem taken up in detail through an ad hoc cormmittee. A report of these deliberations, covering background of the subject, a summary of actions taken, contemplated actions, proposed renedial legislation, general conments and recoumnendations, is enclosed. \n3. Attention is invited to the fact that the conmittee recommends that this report be submitted to the National Security Council for such action as it deems appropriate.  I concur in this recommendation, but feel canpelled to point out that the deliberations of the Comnittee on export control disclosed the extreme vulnerability of the'United States to the entry by air of undesirable personnel as well as extrenely dangerous material and equipment. In my opinion, this aspect of the problem of illicit air transport also deserves careful consideration by the Security Council."
