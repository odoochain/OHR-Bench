        "text": "# \nAs of January 1, 2009, the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law required that Massachusetts residents, eighteen (18) years of age and older, must have health coverage that meets the Minimum Creditable Coverage standards set by the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector, unless waived from the health insurance requirement based on affordability or individual hardship. For more information call the Connector at 1-877-MA-ENROLL or visit the Connector website (www.mahealthconnector.org). \nThis Plan is designed to provide benefits that complement the benefits provided by Medicare Parts A and B. It does not, by itself, provide comprehensive health coverage and does not meet Massachusetts Minimum Creditable Coverage standards.  However, in order to be enrolled in this Plan, all Subscribers must be enrolled in both Medicare Parts A and B.  Under Massachusetts law, any individual enrolled in either Medicare Part A or Part B automatically qualifies as having health coverage that meets Minimum Creditable Coverage standards. \nIn summary, Medicare beneficiaries do not need to be enrolled in this Plan, or any other Medicare complement plan, to have health coverage that meets Massachusetts Minimum Creditable Coverage requirements.  Enrollment in Medicare Parts A or B is all that is required."

(“Harvard Pilgrim”). \nThis Benefit Handbook describes the benefits and the terms and conditions of coverage under the Plan.  The Plan is designed to complement a Subscriber's Medicare coverage by: \n1. Paying most Medicare Deductible and Coinsurance amounts for services covered by Medicare Parts A and B;   \n2. Covering certain services that Medicare does not cover at all; and   \n3. Paying for some Medicare-covered services after your Medicare benefits for those services have been exhausted. \nTo use Plan benefits, simply obtain services from any health care Provider eligible for payment by Medicare. (A few cases in which you do not need to use a Provider eligible for payment by Medicare are described in Section III.D, below.)

        "text": "# \nThis Benefit Handbook, the Schedule of Benefits and the Prescription Drug Brochure make up the legal agreement stating the terms and conditions of the Plan. \nThe Benefit Handbook contains most of the details of your coverage.  The Schedule of Benefits states the Copayments and any other charges that apply to the GIC’s plan.  It also may be used as a brief summary of your benefits. \nThe Plan’s coverage for prescription drugs is described in your Prescription Drug Brochure. It is important that you read that document to understand how to obtain medications at the lowest out-of-pocket cost to you. \nIn writing these documents, we have tried to provide you with all of the information you need to make full use of your benefits under the Plan.  You may use these documents to learn: \n What is covered;   \n What is not covered;   \n Any limits or special rules for coverage;   \n Any Copayments or other charges you have to pay for Covered Services; and   \n Procedures for filing claims and obtaining reimbursement for services. \n# \nSome words in this Benefit Handbook have special meanings.  When we use one of these words, we capitalize it.  We list such words and what they mean in the Glossary at the end of this Handbook \n# \nThe Benefit Handbook begins with a table of contents that will help you find what you need to know. \nWe have also organized this Benefit Handbook with the most important things first.  For example, the Plan’s benefits are described in the next section.  The list of services that are not covered, known as “exclusions,” follow the description of the Plan’s Benefits.  Procedures for obtaining reimbursement follow the list of exclusions. As noted above, Copayments and other charges you need to pay are stated in the Schedule of Benefits. \n# \nMedicare Enhance complements the coverage you receive from the Medicare program.  The information on Medicare benefits contained in this Handbook is only designed to help you make use of your benefits under the Plan.  You should read the Medicare program handbook, Medicare and You for information on your Medicare benefits. You may obtain a copy of Medicare and You at most Social Security Offices and by calling Medicare at 1-800-633-4227.   (TTY service is available at 1-877-486-2048.)  A number of publications explaining Medicare benefits may be obtained on the Internet at the following web address: http://www.medicare.gov/publications/home.asp \n# \nEach Subscriber receives an identification card.  The card contains important information about your coverage.  It must be presented along with your Medicare card whenever you receive health care services. \n# \nMedicare Enhance (the “Plan”) provides GICsponsored health coverage for persons enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B.  A Medicare-eligible Spouse or dependent of an eligible Subscriber may also be enrolled under a separate contract if he or she meets the eligibility requirements of the Plan and the GIC.  The Plan complements Medicare coverage by: \n Paying most Medicare Deductible and Coinsurance amounts for services covered by Medicare;  Covering a number of Special Services that are required to be provided under State law. \nThe benefits of the Plan are explained in detail in Section III, below. \nTo use Plan benefits, simply obtain services from any health care Provider eligible for payment by Medicare. (A few cases in which you do not need to use a Provider eligible for payment by Medicare are described in Section III.D, below.)  In the case of Medicare-covered services, your health care Provider will first bill Medicare for services you receive. You or your Provider may then submit a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) to the Plan for payment of the Medicare Deductible and Coinsurance amount.  In the case of services that are not covered by Medicare, the Plan may be billed directly by either you or your Provider.  Please see Section V (“Reimbursement and Claims Procedures”), below, for a detailed explanation of the Plan’s claim filing procedures."

        "text": "# \nYou are always covered for care you need in a Medical Emergency.  In a Medical Emergency you may obtain services from a physician, a Hospital, or a Hospital emergency room. Within the United States, you are also covered for ambulance transportation to the nearest Hospital that can provide the care you need. Please see your Schedule of Benefits for information on the Copayments that apply to the different types of emergency care. \n# \nThe Plan also provides special benefits for emergency care outside of the United States.  (With very limited exceptions, Medicare does not cover any services received outside of the United States.)   Please see Section III.D.3 of this Handbook for a description of the Plan’s coverage for services received outside of the United States. \nA Medical Emergency is a medical condition, whether physical or mental, manifesting itself by symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that the absence of prompt medical attention could reasonably be expected by a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, to result in placing the health of the Subscriber or another person in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to body function, or serious dysfunction of any body organ or part.  With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions, Medical Emergency also means that there is inadequate time to safely transfer to another Hospital before delivery or that transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. \nExamples of Medical Emergencies are: heart attack or suspected heart attack, stroke, shock, major blood loss, choking, severe head trauma, loss of consciousness, seizures and convulsions. \n# \nSubscribers are required to share the cost of the benefits provided under the Plan.  In some cases there may also be limits on the Plan’s payments for certain services. General information about cost sharing and payment limits is set forth below.  The specific cost sharing and payment limits that apply to your Plan are explained in your Schedule of Benefits. \n# \nMost cost sharing under the Plan is in the form of Copayments.  Copayments are fixed dollar fees that \nSubscribers must pay for certain services covered by the Plan.  Copayments are generally payable at the time of service. \nThe Copayments that apply to your Plan are listed in your Schedule of Benefits. \n# \nThe Plan has established a maximum amount it will pay for different types of Covered Services.  This is called the “Payment Maximum.” For services covered by Medicare, the Payment Maximum is the Medicare approved (or “allowable”) amount for the service. However, Medicare Providers who do not “accept assignment” may charge somewhat more than the Medicare allowable amount.  This is explained in Section V.D (“Claims for Services Covered By Medicare Part B”).  The Payment Maximum may also apply to services that are not covered by Medicare. This is explained in Section V.J. (“The Payment Maximum”) Plan Deductible. \n# \nThe Subscriber agrees that, except where restricted by law, the Plan may have access to (1) all health records and medical data from health care Providers providing services covered under this Benefit Handbook, and (2) information concerning health coverage or claims from all Providers of motor vehicle insurance, medical payment policies, homeowners insurance and all types of health benefit plans. \nThe Plan is committed to ensuring and safeguarding the confidentiality of its Subscribers’ information in all settings, including personal and medical information. The Plan staff access, use and disclose Subscriber information only in connection with providing services and benefits and in accordance with The Plan’s confidentiality policies. The Plan permits only designated employees, who are trained in the proper handling of Subscriber information, to have access to and use of your information.  The Plan sometimes contracts with other organizations or entities to assist with the delivery of care or administration of benefits. Any such entity must agree to adhere to the Plan’s confidentiality and privacy standards. \nWhen you enrolled in the Plan, you consented to certain uses and disclosures of information which are necessary for the provision and administration of services and benefits, such as: coordinating care; conducting quality activities, including Subscriber satisfaction surveys and disease management programs; verifying eligibility; fraud detection; and certain oversight reviews, such as accreditation and regulatory audits. When the Plan discloses Subscriber information, it does so using the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish the specific activity."

        "text": "# \nThis section describes the products and services covered by the Plan. \nThe Plan covers services in conjunction with your benefits under Medicare Parts A and B.  Medicare is the primary payer for Medicare-covered services.  The Plan will only provide coverage for such services after your Medicare benefits have been determined.  The Plan also provides coverage for a number of benefits required by State law that may not be covered by Medicare as well as coverage for additional benefits not covered by Medicare.  These benefits are described in Sections III.C (“State Mandated Benefits”) and III.D (“Additional Covered Services”), below and your Schedule of Benefits. \nTo be covered by the plan, a product or service must meet each of the following basic requirements: \n It must be Medically Necessary;   \n It must be received while the Member is enrolled as a Subscriber in the Plan;   \n It must be either covered by Medicare or listed as a Covered Service in this Benefit Handbook, the Schedule of Benefits or the Prescription Drug Brochure; and   \n It must not be listed as a product or service that is excluded from coverage by the Plan. \nAll coverage is subject to the Copayments listed in the Schedule of Benefits.  Payments by the Plan are limited to the Payment Maximum described in Section V (“Reimbursement and Claims Procedures”) and the Glossary.  The Subscriber is responsible for any amount billed by a Provider that is in excess of the Payment Maximum for that service. \n# \nThis section describes your benefits for services that are covered by the Medicare program.  The Plan covers the Medicare Deductible and Coinsurance amounts for all services covered by Medicare Parts A and B.  All coverage is subject to the Subscriber Copayments stated in the Schedule of Benefits.  In all cases, the decision of the Medicare program to provide coverage for a service must have been made before any Plan benefits will be payable under this section.  No coverage will be provided by the Plan for any service denied by Medicare unless the service is specifically listed in Sections III.C or III. D, below. \nThe following is a summary of the services covered by Medicare Parts A and B.  (Please see “Medicare and You” for additional information on Medicare coverage.) When Medicare Parts A and B covers a service but does not pay the full amount, the Plan covers the applicable Medicare Coinsurance and Deductible amounts up to the Payment Maximum, less any Plan copayment. \n# \n# \nMedicare coverage for inpatient Hospital  care is determined by Benefit Periods.  There is no limit to the number of Benefit Periods covered by Medicare during your lifetime.  However, Medicare benefits for inpatient Hospital care are limited to 90 days during a Benefit Period.  If you exhaust the 90-day limit during a Benefit Period, you can elect to use up to 60 additional days of inpatient Hospital care during that Benefit Period from your Medicare “lifetime reserve days.”  These are non-renewable days of hospital coverage that you may use only once in your life. \nMost hospital care covered by Medicare may be obtained at any Medicare-certified Hospital, including a psychiatric hospital.  However, certain services including liver, lung, heart, heart-lung, pancreas and intestine transplants and bariatric surgery must be obtained at a Hospital that has been approved by Medicare for the specific type of surgery required.  These Hospitals are required to meet strict quality standards. If Medicare requires that a service be provided at a Hospital specifically approved for the service, neither Medicare nor the Plan will provide any coverage if the service is obtained at an unapproved Hospital. \nIf you exhaust the 190-day Medicare limit for inpatient services in a psychiatric hospital, you may be eligible for additional coverage for inpatient care beyond the Medicare limit.  See Section III.D.1. below. \nThe Plan will provide the following coverage in connection with semi-private room and board and Special Services for Medicare-covered inpatient Hospital services: \ni.  Deductible:  The Plan will pay the Medicare Part A Deductible amount applicable to the 1st day of hospitalization through the 60th day of hospitalization in each Benefit Period."

The Plan provides coverage for Hospital care in excess of the Medicare limits described above, which is listed in Section III.D (“Additional Covered Services”) and your Schedule of Benefits. \n# \nThe Plan covers the Medicare Deductible and Coinsurance amounts for Medicare-covered care in a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF).  Medicare covers up to 100 days per Benefit Period in a Medicarecertified SNF. To be eligible for coverage, all rules applicable to Medicare coverage of SNF care must be met.  These include the following: \n The Subscriber needs skilled nursing or rehabilitative care;  The care is required on a daily basis;  The care can, as a practical matter, only be provided in an inpatient setting; and  The Subscriber must have been an inpatient in a Hospital for at least three days and enter the SNF within 30 days after Hospital discharge. \nThere is no coverage for care received in a SNF that does not meet Medicare coverage rules, including the requirements stated above. \nThe following is a description of the coverage provided by the Plan for care in a Medicare-certified SNF: \ni.  First 20 Days:  Medicare covers from the 1st day of inpatient services through the 20th day of inpatient services in each Benefit Period.  No coverage is provided by the Plan. \nii. Coinsurance:  The Plan will cover the Medicare Part A daily Coinsurance amount for a semi-private room and board and Special Services from the 21st day of inpatient services through the 100th day of inpatient services in each Benefit Period. \n# \nThe Plan will cover the Medicare Part A Coinsurance and Deductible amounts for inpatient care in a Religious Nonmedical Health Care Institution (RNHCI), such as a Christian Science Sanatorium. All Medicare conditions and limitations on the coverage of services in a RNHCI also apply to the coverage provided by the Plan.  Religious aspects of care provided in RNHCIs are not covered. \n\n# \n# \nThe Plan will pay the Medicare Coinsurance and Deductible amounts for Medicare-covered services provided at a hospital emergency room or other emergency facility, less than the Plan Emergency Room copayment. \n# \nThe Plan will pay the Medicare Coinsurance and Deductible amounts for Medicare-covered services provided at 1) a convenience care clinic or (2) an urgent care clinic, entitled to coverage by the Medicare program, less the applicable Plan copayment. \nConvenience care clinics provide treatment for minor illnesses and injuries.  They are usually staffed by non-physician providers, such as nurse practitioners, and are located in stores, supermarkets or pharmacies. \nUrgent care clinics provide treatment for illnesses and injuries that require urgent attention but are not life threatening.  Urgent care clinics are independent clinics or certain hospital-owned clinics that provide urgent care services.  Urgent care clinics are staffed by doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. \nImportant Notice: Urgent Care is not emergency care. You should call 911 or go directly to a hospital emergency room if you suspect you are having a Medical Emergency. These include heart attack or suspected heart attack, shock, major blood loss, or loss of consciousness. Please see section II.C. (“Coverage in a Medical Emergency”) for more information. \n# \nThe Plan will pay the Medicare Coinsurance and Deductible amounts for Medicare-covered services provided by physicians and other health professionals entitled to coverage by the Medicare program, less the applicable Plan copayment.  Such health professionals include, but are not limited to, certified nurse-midwives, chiropractors, clinical social workers, clinical psychologists, dentists, nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, physical therapists, physicians’ assistants, podiatrists, speech therapists, audiologists and registered dieticians.

        "text": "# \nThis section explains how to obtain payments for Covered Services from the Plan.  Because Plan benefits generally depend upon the coverage provided by Medicare, Providers must bill Medicare for services covered by Medicare before billing the Plan. \nThe Plan will usually cover benefits by making payments directly to service providers.  However, there are times when the Plan will pay you (the Subscriber) instead.  This might occur, for example, when you have already paid the Provider for a Covered Service or when a Provider does not accept Medicare assignment.  In such cases, the Plan may pay benefits directly to you. \nClaims will be paid minus the Copayment, if applicable, that is listed in your Schedule of Benefits. All payments by the Plan are limited to the Payment Maximum described in the Subsection J, below.  You are responsible for any amount billed by a Provider that is in excess of the Payment Maximum. \nClaims will be reviewed within 45 days of receipt.  If a claim cannot be paid within that time, the plan will either notify the Subscriber (1) that additional documentation is needed or (2) that the claim is denied, in whole or in part, and the reasons for denial. If the Plan does not provide such notice, interest will be payable to the Subscriber at the rate of $1.5\\%$ per month (not to exceed $18\\%$ per year) on the amount of benefits payable, beginning 45 days after receipt of the claim.  However, no interest will be payable on any claim that the Plan is investigating because of suspected fraud. \n# \nAll claims for benefits, except pharmacy and mental health and substance abuse claims, must be submitted to the Plan at the following address: \nMedicare Enhance Claims HPHC Insurance Company, Inc. P.O. Box 699183 Quincy, MA 02269-9183 \nAll claims for mental health and substance abuse services should be mailed to: \nHPIC - Behavioral Health Access Center   \nC/O UBH   \nP.O.

        "text": "# \nThis section explains the procedure to follow to obtain benefits for services covered by Medicare Part A, also known as Medicare Hospital Insurance.  Medicare Part A services include inpatient care received in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and Religious Nonmedical Health Care Institutions (RNHCIs). Medicare Part A also covers hospice services and some home health care. \nUse this procedure to file a claim for any inpatient service that is, or may be, eligible for coverage by Medicare Part A. See Subsections E (“Claims for Services Not Covered By Medicare”) and F (“Claims for Services Received in a Foreign Country”), below, for information on how to file a claim for an inpatient service that is not covered by Medicare.  To obtain benefits for services under Medicare Part A, please follow these steps: \n1. Bill Medicare First. Providers should first submit claims for Medicare Part A services to Medicare. Medicare will either pay the claim, in whole or in part, or deny coverage.  You will be sent a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN).  The MSN states the payment made by Medicare and explains any amount that was denied. \n2. Then Bill Medicare Enhance. After the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) is received from Medicare, the Subscriber or Provider must send each of the following items to the Plan to the address listed above: \ni. A copy of the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN); and   \nii. A standard UB 92 claim form completed by the Provider.  (If a completed UB 92 claim form cannot be submitted, please see below.) \nIf a completed UB 92 claim form cannot be submitted, most claims can be processed using an itemized bill from the Provider in place of the claim form.  Such an itemized bill must contain the following:   The Subscriber’s name, the Subscriber’s Plan ID. Provider’s name and address, the Provider’s Medicare identification number, the date the service was rendered, the diagnosis and procedure codes for the service, and the dollar amount of the claim. \nThe Plan may require the submission of additional information on some claims. \n# \nThis section explains the procedure to follow to obtain benefits for services covered by Medicare Part B, also known as Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance for the Aged and Disabled.  Medicare Part B covers most outpatient services including most physician care, diagnostic tests, outpatient surgery, outpatient mental health care, physical, occupational and speech-language therapy and durable medical equipment. \n# \nHealth care professionals, such as physicians, and suppliers of health care equipment and supplies, may bill for Medicare-covered services using one of two methods. These are that a Provider may either (1) “accept assignment” or (2) “not accept assignment” from Medicare.  The following information on these billing methods is provided, for informational purposes only, to assist you in understanding your medical bills and the coverage available from the Plan.  Please see the Medicare publication, Medicare and You for additional information on assignment and the limits that apply to Provider charges. \n# \nIf a Provider accepts assignment from Medicare, the Provider agrees that he or she will accept Medicare’s approved (or “allowable”) amount as payment in full for the service rendered.  When a physician accepts assignment the physician may not bill for more than the Medicare allowable amount and Medicare will pay the physician directly. \nWhen a Provider accepts assignment, physician payment generally works as follows:  The Provider bills Medicare.  Medicare pays the Provider directly and send you a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) explaining the payment.   Then, either you or the Provider files a claim with the Plan for the balance due the Provider.  For most physician services the Plan covers any unmet Medicare Deductible amount and the $20\\%$ Medicare Coinsurance amount, minus any Copayment you owe. \n# \nIf a Provider does not accept assignment from Medicare, the Provider may charge you more than the Medicare-approved amount.  If the Provider selects that option, Medicare will not pay the Provider directly. Medicare will pay benefits to you (the Subscriber) and you are responsible for paying the Provider. \nWhen a Provider does not accept assignment, physician payment generally works as follows:  The Provider bills Medicare.  Medicare pays you (the Subscriber) and sends you a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) explaining the payment.  In most cases, you then file a claim with the Plan.  For most physician services the Plan covers any unmet Medicare Deductible amount and the $20\\%$ Medicare Coinsurance amount, minus any Copayment you owe.  The $20\\%$ Coinsurance amount paid by the Plan is based on the Medicare-approved amount, not the Provider’s actual charge.  If the Provider charged you an amount in excess of the Medicare-approved amount, you are responsible for paying that excess to the physician."

In addition, professionals or institutions that are not eligible to bill Medicare may provide certain Covered Services under Section III.C of this Handbook. \nWhenever possible, your Providers should first bill Medicare for the services you receive.  Submission of a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), even if Medicare denies coverage, will prevent delays in the processing of claims that might be eligible for Medicare coverage.  To bill the Plan for a service that is not covered by Medicare, please follow the procedure outlined below.

        "text": "# \nPlease consult your Prescription Drug Brochure for the details of your coverage.  As explained in that Brochure, you should only need to file a claim for the reimbursement of covered pharmacy expenses if you do not use a participating pharmacy. In that event, you will have to pay the retail price for the medication and submit a claim for reimbursement. \nIn order to process a claim for the reimbursement of pharmacy expenses you will need to submit a drug store receipt with the following information:  (1) the Subscriber’s name, (2) the Subscriber’s Plan ID number, (3) the name of the drug or medical supply, (4) the NDC number, (5) the quantity purchased, (6) the number of days supply, (7) the date the prescription was filled, (8) the prescribing physician’s name, (9) the name and address of the pharmacy, and (10) the amount paid.  The Plan may require the submission of additional information to process some claims. \nRequests for pharmacy reimbursement must be sent to: \nMedImpact   \nDMR Department   \n10680 Treena Street, $5^{\\mathrm{th}}$ Floor   \nSan Diego, CA 92131 \nSubscribers may contact the MedImpact help desk at 1-800-788-2949 for assistance with pharmacy claims. \n# \nSubscribers may assign payments by the Plan to Providers by signing the appropriate section of the Provider’s claim.  The Plan will pay the Provider directly if benefits are assigned.  If the Subscriber does not assign benefits to the Provider, the Plan will make payment for Covered Services to the Subscriber. The Subscriber will then be responsible for paying the Provider. \n# \nAll claims received from Providers or Subscribers for Covered Services must be submitted to the Plan at the address above within two years of the date of service, or the date of discharge if services were rendered on an inpatient basis.  Whether the Subscriber or the Provider submits the claims, it is the Subscriber's responsibility to ensure that the claims are submitted within the above time frame. \n# \nThe Plan limits the amount it will pay for any Covered Service to the “Payment Maximum.”  The Payment Maximum is as follows: \na. For Medicare-covered Items. If Medicare Part A or B covers a product or service, the Payment Maximum is the Medicare Coinsurance amount plus any unmet Medicare Deductible amount.  The Medicare Coinsurance amount is the portion or percentage of the Medicare-approved payment amount for a product or service that a beneficiary is responsible for paying. (Note that any Plan payment will be reduced by any applicable Copayment specified in the Subscriber’s Schedule of Benefits.) \nIn some cases, providers may bill Medicare patients for amounts that exceed the Medicare-approved payment amount.  Any amount that exceeds the Medicareapproved amount is the Subscriber’s responsibility and is not payable either by Medicare or the Plan.  Please see the discussion of “assignment” in the Medicare publication Medicare and You for information on limits that apply to Provider charges. \nb.  For Items Not Covered by Medicare.  If Medicare Part A or B does not cover a product or service, the Payment Maximum depends upon whether the Provider is under contract to provide services to Subscribers of HPHC Insurance Company (HPIC).  If a Provider is under contract to HPIC, the Payment Maximum is the contracted rate for the service.  If the Provider is not under contract to HPIC, the Payment Maximum is the amount, as determined by HPIC, which is within the normal range of charges made by health care Providers for the same, or similar, products or services in Boston, Massachusetts."

        "text": "This section explains the Plan’s procedures for processing appeals and complaints concerning the benefits or services provided by the Plan.  This section also explains the options available if an appeal is denied. \nPlease note that the appeal procedures stated below only apply to benefits of the Harvard Pilgrim Medicare Enhance Plan.  If Medicare denies a claim, you must appeal to Medicare.  Information on your Medicare appeal rights may be found on the Medicare Summary Notice, the document sent to you by Medicare that explains what action Medicare has taken on a claim. \nA. HOW TO FILE AN APPEAL OR COMPLAINT Any appeal or complaint may be filed in person, by mail, by FAX or by telephone. \nAppeals or complaints, other than those concerning mental health or drug and alcohol rehabilitation services, should be submitted to: \nMember Services Department HPHC Insurance Company 1600 Crown Colony Drive Quincy, MA 02169. \nTelephone:  1-888-333-4742   \nFAX:  1-617-509-3085 \nAppeals or complaints concerning mental health or drug and alcohol rehabilitation services should be submitted to: \n# \nc/o United Behavioral Health Appeals Department 100 East Penn Square, Suite 400 Philadelphia, PA 19107 \nTelephone:  1-888-777-4742   \nFAX:  1-888-881-7453 \n# \nWhat are “Appeals” and “Complaints”?  HPIC divides grievances into two types, “appeals” and “complaints” as follows: \n An appeal may be filed whenever a Subscriber is denied coverage by HPIC.  This includes either the denial of a health service sought by a Subscriber or the denial of payment for a health service that a Subscriber has received.   \n A complaint may be filed when a Subscriber seeks redress of any action taken by HPIC or any aspect of HPIC’s services, other than a denial of coverage for health services. \nBoth appeals and complaints should be filed at the addresses or telephone numbers listed above in subsection 1. \nSubscriber Representation.  A Subscriber’s authorized representative may file an appeal or complaint and participate in any part of the appeal or complaint process. Any notice referred to in this section will be provided to the Subscriber or, upon request, the Subscriber’s representative. \nA Subscriber’s representative may be the Subscriber’s guardian, conservator, agent under a power of attorney, health care agent under a health care proxy, family member or any other person appointed in writing to represent the Subscriber in a specific appeal or complaint to HPIC.  HPIC may require documentation that a representative meets one of the above criteria. \nTime Limit for Filing Appeals.  A request for informal inquiry or appeal must be filed within 180 days of the date a service, or payment for a service, is denied by HPIC. \n# \nSpecial rights apply to appeals involving medical necessity determinations.  Such an appeal could involve a decision that a service (1) is not Medically Necessary, (2) is not being provided in an appropriate health care setting or level of care, (3) is not effective for treatment of the Subscriber’s condition, or (4) is Experimental or Unproven.  These include the right to appeal to an external review organization under contract with the Office of Patient Protection of the Department of Public Health.  The procedure for obtaining external review is summarized below in subsection 6. \nThe Office of Patient Protection. The Office of Patient Protection of the Department of Public Health is the agency responsible for enforcing the Massachusetts laws concerning managed care grievance rights and for administering appeals to external review organizations. The Office of Patient Protection also enforces health care standards for managed care organizations, answers consumers questions about managed care and monitors quality-related health insurance information relating to managed care practices."

HPIC will file an annual report on appeals and complaints with the Office of Patient Protection.  After filing, the report for the prior year will be available to Subscribers upon request.  A copy may be requested from the Member Services Department at the address or telephone number listed above in subsection 1. \nMembership Required for Coverage.  To be eligible for coverage by HPIC, a Subscriber must be duly enrolled under this Handbook on the date a service is received.  A response to an informal inquiry or an appeal decision approving coverage will not be valid for services received after the termination of membership.  However, payment may be made after the termination of membership for services received while membership was effective. \n# \nMost appeals and complaints result from a misunderstanding with a provider or a claim processing error.  Since these problems can be easy to resolve, most appeals and complaints will first be considered in HPIC’s informal inquiry process. However, the informal inquiry process will not be used to review a denial of coverage involving a medical necessity determination.  Coverage decisions involving medical necessity determinations will be transferred directly to the formal appeal process described below in subsection 4. \nDuring the informal inquiry process an HPIC Member Services representative will investigate an appeal or complaint and attempt to resolve it to the Subscriber’s satisfaction.  Whenever possible, the Member Services representative will provide the Subscriber with a response within 3 business days of receipt of the inquiry.  This response will normally be communicated by telephone. \nIf the Member Services representative responds to an inquiry within 3 business days of receipt but the inquiry is not resolved to the Subscriber’s satisfaction, the Subscriber may either file a formal complaint or appeal, as appropriate. \nIf the Member Services representative cannot respond to the inquiry within 3 business days, HPIC will transfer the inquiry to the formal appeal or formal complaint process, as appropriate. \n# \nHPIC’s internal appeal process is available whenever a Subscriber is denied coverage by HPIC.  This includes either the denial of a health service sought by a Subscriber or the denial of payment for a health service that a Subscriber has received.  If a denial involves a medical necessity determination, an appeal may be filed immediately.  All other appeals will be considered in the informal inquiry process, described above in subsection 3, before an appeal is filed. \nHow to File an Appeal.  Appeals may be filed in person, by mail, by FAX or by telephone at the addresses or telephone numbers listed in subsection 1, above.   After an appeal is filed, HPIC will appoint an Appeal Coordinator who will be responsible for the appeal during the appeal process. \nDocumentation of Oral Appeals.  If an appeal is filed by telephone, an Appeal Coordinator will write a summary of the appeal and send it to the Subscriber within 48 hours of receipt.  This time limit may be extended by written mutual agreement between the Subscriber and HPIC. \nAcknowledgment of Appeals.  Appeals will be acknowledged in writing within 15 days of receipt by HPIC. This time limit may be extended by written mutual agreement between the Subscriber and HPIC.  No acknowledgment of an appeal will be sent if an Appeal Coordinator has previously sent a summary of an appeal submitted by telephone. \nRelease of Medical Records.  Any appeal that requires the review of medical information must include a signed “Authorization for Release of Medical Information.” This form must be signed and dated by the Subscriber or the Subscriber’s authorized representative.  (When signed by an authorized representative, appropriate proof of authorization to release medical information must be provided.)  If an Authorization for Release of Medical Information form is not provided when the appeal is filed, the Appeal Coordinator will promptly send a blank form to the Subscriber or the Subscriber’s representative.  If a signed Authorization for Release of Medical Information is not received by HPIC within 30 business days of the date the appeal is received, HPIC may issue a decision based on the information already in the file."

        "text": "# \nAppeals? HPIC divides appeals into two types, “Pre-Service Appeals” and “Post-Service Appeals” as follows: \n A “Pre-Service Appeal” requests coverage of a health care service that the Subscriber has not yet received.   \n A “Post-Service Appeal” requests coverage of a health care service that the Subscriber has already received. \nTime Limit for Processing Appeals.  For PreService Appeals, Subscribers will be provided with a written appeal decision within 30 days of the date the appeal was received by HPIC.  For Post-Service Appeals, Subscribers will be provided with a written appeal decision within 30 business days of the date the appeal was received by HPIC.  These time limits may be extended by mutual agreement between the Subscriber and HPIC. (Any such agreement must be in writing.)  Any extension will not exceed 30 business days from the date of the agreement.  HPIC may decline to extend the review period for an appeal if a service has been continued pending an appeal. \nIf an appeal requires the review of medical information, the date of receipt will be the date HPIC receives a signed Authorization for Release of Medical Information.  If HPIC does not respond to an informal inquiry within 3 business days, the date of receipt will be the 4th business day following the date HPIC received the inquiry or the date HPIC receives the signed Authorization for Release of Medical Information, whichever is later.  No appeal shall be deemed received until actual receipt of the appeal by HPIC at the appropriate address or telephone number listed in subsection 1, above. \nIf HPIC does not act on an appeal within 30 business days plus any extension of time mutually agreed upon in writing by the Subscriber and HPIC, the appeal will be deemed to be resolved in favor of the Subscriber. \nMedical Records and Information.  The Appeal Coordinator will try to obtain all information, including medical records, relevant to the appeal. Due to the limited time available for the processing of appeals, Subscribers may be asked to assist the Appeal Coordinator in obtaining any missing information or to extend the appeal time limit until such information can be obtained.  If information cannot be obtained by the 15th day following the receipt of the Authorization for Release of Medical Information and no agreement can be reached on extending the appeal time limit, the appeal may be decided without the missing information. \nContinuation of Services Pending Appeal.  If an appeal is filed concerning the termination or reduction of coverage for ongoing treatment, such coverage will be continued through the completion of HPIC’s internal appeal process if: \na. The service was authorized by HPIC prior to a request for an informal inquiry or the filing of an appeal; b. The service was not terminated or reduced due to a benefit limit under this Handbook; and c. The appellant is, and continues to be, enrolled in this Plan. \nThe Appeal Process.  Upon receipt of an appeal, HPIC will review, investigate and decide an appeal within the applicable time limit unless the time limit is extended by mutual agreement. \nThe Appeal Coordinator will investigate the appeal and determine if additional information is required from the Subscriber.  Such information may include medical records, statements from doctors, and bills and receipts for services the Subscriber has received.  The Subscriber may also provide HPIC with any written comments, documents, records or other information related to the claim. Should HPIC need additional information to decide an appeal, the Appeal Coordinator will contact the Subscriber and request the specific information needed. \nAppeals that involve a medical necessity determination will be reviewed by a health care professional in active practice in a specialty that is the same as, or similar to, the medical specialty that typically treats the medical condition that is the subject of the appeal. The health care professional conducting the review must not have either participated in any prior decision on the Subscriber’s appeal or be the subordinate of such a person. \nHPIC will make a decision following the investigation and review of the appeal.  In making a decision, HPIC will consider the following review criteria: (1) the benefits and the terms and conditions of coverage stated in this Handbook; (2) the views of medical professionals who have cared for the Subscriber; (3) the views of any specialist who has reviewed the appeal; (4) any relevant records or other documents provided by the Subscriber; and (5) any other relevant information available to HPIC. \nHPIC’s decision of an appeal will be sent to the Subscriber in writing.  The decision will identify the specific information considered in your appeal and an explanation of the basis for the decision with reference to the plan provisions on which the decision was based.  If the decision is to deny coverage based on an Medical Necessity determination, the decision will include: (1) the specific information upon which the decision was based; (2) the Subscriber’s presenting symptoms or condition, diagnosis and treatment interventions and the specific reasons such medical evidence fails to meet the relevant medical review criteria; (3) identification of any alternative treatment option covered by HPIC; and (4) the applicable clinical practice and review criteria information relied on to make the decision.  The decision will also include a description of other options available for further review of the appeal.  These options are described in Section 6, below."

Any such appeal will be decided prior to the termination or reduction of HPIC coverage for the Subscriber’s hospital stay.  Coverage for services will be continued through the completion of the HPIC appeals process. HPIC will provide the Subscriber with written notification of the appeal decision prior to discharge from a hospital. \n# \nAn expedited review will be provided for appeals for services or durable medical equipment that, if not immediately provided, could result in serious harm to the Subscriber.  “Serious harm” means circumstances that could (1) jeopardize the life or health of the Subscriber, (2) jeopardize the ability of the Subscriber to regain maximum function, or (3) result in severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment requested. \nAn expedited review will be provided in any case in which HPIC has denied coverage for a service or durable medical equipment if the physician recommending the treatment or durable medical equipment provides HPIC with a written certification stating that: \ni.

The risk of serious harm is so immediate that the provision of the services or durable medical equipment should not await the outcome of the normal appeal process. \nAny such certification must contain the name, address and telephone number of the certifying physician and his or her signature.  Certifications may be delivered in person, by mail or by FAX at the addresses and telephone numbers listed above in this subsection.  Upon receipt of a proper certification, HPIC will review the denial of coverage and provide the Subscriber with notice of the decision within 48 hours.  A decision may take place earlier than 48 hours for durable medical equipment if (1) a request for such early reversal is included in the certification and (2) the physician’s certification includes specific facts indicating that immediate and severe harm to the Subscriber that will result from a 48-hour delay. \n# \nIf a Subscriber with a terminal illness files an appeal of a denial of coverage, a decision will be made by HPIC within 5 business days of receipt of the appeal.  A terminal illness is an illness that is likely to cause death within 6 months. \nIf a decision is made on appeal to deny coverage to a Subscriber with a terminal illness, HPIC will provide the Subscriber with a written decision letter within 5 business days of the decision.  The decision letter will include: \n1. A statement of any medical and scientific reasons for the denial; and   \n2. A description of any relevant alternative treatment, services, or supplies covered by HPIC. \nIf a decision is made on appeal to deny coverage to a Subscriber with a terminal illness, the Subscriber may request a meeting with an HPIC review committee to reconsider the denial.  The meeting will be held within 10 days of request, unless the treating physician requests that it be held earlier. In such event, the meeting will be held within 5 business days.  At the meeting the Subscriber and the committee will review the information previously provided in response to the Subscriber’s appeal.  The review committee will have authority to approve or deny the appeal.  The review committee’s decision will be the final decision of HPIC. \n# \nIf you disagree with the decision of your appeal, you may have a number of options for further review.  These options may include (1) reconsideration of appeals that involve a Medical Necessity determination (as described in Section VI.B.) by an HPIC review committee, (2) external review by an independent organization appointed by the Office of Patient Protection, or (3) legal action. Below is a summary of these options. \n# \nIf a Subscriber disagrees with a decision concerning an appeal that involves a Medical Necessity determination, the Subscriber may request reconsideration of such appeal by the HPIC review committee.  The Subscriber must request reconsideration within 15 days of the date of HPIC’s letter denying the appeal.  Reconsideration is not available for the following types of appeals: \n Decisions involving a benefit limitation where the limit is stated in the Handbook   \n Decisions involving excluded services, except Experimental, Unproven, or Investigational services, and   \n Decisions concerning Member cost sharing requirements \nThe Subscriber may request that the committee review the appeal based upon the documents and records in the appeal file without participating in the meeting.  Alternately, the Subscriber, or the Subscriber’s representative, may participate in the committee’s meeting via telephone conference call to discuss the appeal. \nSubscribers are welcome to provide HPIC with any additional documents or records concerning the Subscriber’s appeal prior to the meeting.  The HPIC review committee will provide the Subscriber with a written decision of their review of the Subscriber’s appeal. \nHPIC’s reconsideration process is voluntary and optional. A Subscriber may request reconsideration by HPIC before or after seeking any other dispute resolution process described below.  The only exception involves appeals that have been accepted by the Office of Patient Protection for external review.  For example a Subscriber may request reconsideration of an appeal before seeking external review from the Office of Patient Protection, or the Subscriber may proceed directly to external review. A Subscriber may also request reconsideration if the Office of Patient Protection has determined that an appeal is not eligible for external review.  However, HPIC will not reconsider an appeal that has been accepted for external review by the Office of Patient Protection."

A Subscriber’s authorized representative may act on their behalf, and file a request for reconsideration and participate in the review committee’s meeting.  On reconsideration, the HPIC review committee will make an impartial evaluation of the Subscriber’s appeal based on the review criteria in subsection 4 above without deference to any prior decisions made on the claim. \nHPIC will not assert that a Subscriber has failed to exhaust administrative remedies because the Subscriber has chosen not to seek reconsideration of an appeal that has been denied under the formal appeal process.  HPIC also agrees that any statute of limitations or defense based on timeliness is tolled during the time period in which a request for reconsideration is pending. \nNo fees or costs will be charged by HPIC for reconsidering an appeal decision. \n# \nAny Subscriber who wishes to contest a final appeal decision involving a medical necessity determination may request external review of the decision by an independent organization under contract with the Office of Patient Protection of the Department of Public Health.  To obtain external review, a written request for external review must be filed with the Office of Patient Protection within 4 months of receipt of the written notice of the appeal decision by HPIC.  A copy of the external review form will be enclosed with your notice from HPIC of its decision to deny your appeal. \nA request for an external review must meet the following requirements: \n1. The request must be submitted on the Office of Patient Protection’s application form called, “Request for Independent External Review of a Health Care Decision.”  A copy of this form may be obtained by calling the Member Services Department at 888-333-4742.  It may also be obtained from the Office of Patient Protection by calling 1-800-436-7757.  In addition, copies of the form may be downloaded from the Department's website at http://www.state.ma.us/dph/opp/forms.htm.   \n2. The form must include the Subscriber's signature, or the signature of the Subscriber’s authorized representative, consenting to the release of medical information. \n3. A copy of HPIC's final appeal decision must be enclosed. \n4. A fee of $\\$25$ must be paid.  The Office of Patient Protection may waive this fee for extreme financial hardship. \nThe Office of Patient Protection will screen requests for external review to determine whether external review can be granted.  If the Office of Patient Protection determines that a request is eligible for external review, the appeal will be assigned to an external review agency and the Subscriber (or Subscriber representative) and HPIC will be notified. The decision of the external review agency is binding and must be complied with by HPIC. \nIf the Office of Patient Protection determines that a request is not eligible for external review, the Subscriber (or Subscriber representative) will be notified within 10 business days, or in the case of requests for expedited review, 72 hours. \nThe Office of Patient Protection may be reached at: \nDepartment of Public Health Office of Patient Protection 99 Chauncy Street Boston, MA  02111 \nTelephone:  1-800-436-7757   \nFax:  1-617-624-5046 \nWeb Site: http://www.state.ma.us/dph/opp/index.htm \nThe Office of Patient Protection may arrange for an expedited external review.  A request for expedited external review must include a written certification from a physician that a delay in providing or continuing the health services that are the subject of the appeal decision would pose a serious and immediate threat to the health of the insured. \nIf the subject of an external review involves the termination of ongoing services, the Subscriber may ask the external review panel to continue coverage for the service while the review is pending.  Any request for continuation of coverage must be made before the end of the second business day following receipt of the final adverse decision.  The review panel may order the continuation of coverage if it finds that substantial harm to the Subscriber’s health may result from the termination of coverage.  The panel may also order the continuation of coverage for good cause.  Any such continuation of coverage shall be at HPIC’s expense regardless of the final external review determination."

Due to the limited time available for processing complaints, Subscribers may be asked to assist the Member Services Representative in obtaining any missing information or to extend the time limit for response to the complaint until such information can be obtained.  If information cannot be obtained by the 15th day following the receipt of the Authorization for Release of Medical Information and no agreement can be reached on extending the time limit for responding to the complaint, the Member Services Representative may respond to the complaint without the missing information."

If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered a person longer, are determined before those of the plan which covered a person for a shorter period of time. \ni.  To determine the length of time a person has been covered under a plan, two plans shall be treated as one if the claimant was eligible under the second within 24 hours after the first ended. \nii. The start of a new plan does not include: (a) a change in the amount or scope of a plan's benefits; (b) a change in the entity which pays, provides or administers the plan's benefits; or (c) a change from one type of plan to another (such as, from a single employer plan to that of a multiple employer plan). \niii. The person's length of time covered under a plan is measured from the person's first date of coverage under that plan. If that date is not readily available, the date the person first became a Subscriber of the group shall be used as the date from which to determine the length of time the person's coverage under the present plan has been in force. \n# \nSubrogation is a means by which health plans recover expenses of services where a third party is legally responsible or alleged to be legally responsible for your Member’s injury or illness. \nIf another person or entity is, or alleged to be, liable to pay for services related to your Member’s illness or injury which have been paid for or provided by the GIC, the GIC will be subrogated and succeed to all rights to recover against such person or entity up to the value of the services paid for or provided by the GIC.

Clinician Advisory Committees work in collaboration with Medical Management leadership to develop and approve utilization review criteria. \n# \nAs described in Section III, above, the Plan covers the Medicare Deductible and Coinsurance amounts for all services covered by Medicare Parts A and B.  If a benefit is added to the Medicare program, that benefit will be automatically added to the plan on the effective date of the benefit, subject to the terms of the contract between HPHC Insurance Company and the GIC."

        "text": "The Plan reserves the right to communicate with Medicare about whether a Medicare coverage decision has been properly made for any reason, including, but not limited to, suspected fraud.  However, the Plan is not required to do so in any case.  Any decision by Medicare to cover, or not to cover, a product or service, is entirely the decision of Medicare.  The Plan will not conduct utilization review of any charge for which Medicare has made a final decision to provide coverage. \n# \nThe Plan may conduct utilization review of any product or service covered under the Plan that is not covered by Medicare, including a product or service for which Medicare coverage has ended for any reason.  The goal of such review is to evaluate the Medical Necessity of selected health care services and to facilitate clinically appropriate, cost-effective management of Subscribers’ care.  The Plan uses the following utilization review procedures: \n Concurrent utilization review of admissions to Hospitals and extended care facilities, and skilled home health services.  Concurrent review decisions will be made within one working day of obtaining all necessary information. In the case of a determination to approve additional services, the Plan will notify the Provider rendering the service by telephone within 24 hours of the decision and will send a written or electronic confirmation of the telephone notification to the Subscriber and the Provider within one working day thereafter. In the case of an adverse determination, we will notify the Provider rendering the service by telephone within 24 hours of the decision and will send a written or electronic confirmation of the telephone notification to the Subscriber and the Provider within one working day thereafter. \n Retrospective utilization review may be utilized in situations where coverage is requested for services that, in the judgment of the Plan, may not be Medically Necessary \nActive case management and discharge planning is incorporated as part of the concurrent review process. \nSubscribers who wish to determine the status or outcome of utilization review decisions should call Member Services toll-free at (888) 333-4742. \nIn the event of an adverse determination involving clinical review, your treating Provider may discuss your case with a Plan physician reviewer or may seek reconsideration of the decision.  The reconsideration will take place within one working day of your Provider’s request.  If the adverse determination is not reversed on reconsideration, you may appeal.  Your appeal rights are described in Section VI (“Appeals and Complaints”). Your right to appeal does not depend on whether or not your Provider sought reconsideration. \n# \nThe Plan covers medical devices, diagnostic, medical and surgical procedures and drugs as described in your Benefit Handbook, Schedule of Benefits, and the Prescription Drug Brochure.  This includes new devices, procedures and drugs, as well as those with new applications, as long as they are not Experimental or Unproven. \nThe Plan has a dedicated team of staff that evaluates diagnostics, medical therapies, surgical procedures, medical devices and drugs.  The team manages the evidence-based evaluation process from initial inquiry to final policy recommendation.  The team researches the safety and effectiveness of these new technologies by reviewing published medical reports and literature, consulting with expert practitioners, and benchmarking. The team presents its recommendations to internal policy committees responsible for making decisions regarding coverage of the new technology under the Plan. \n# \nThe Plan requires consent to the disclosure of information regarding services for mental disorders to the same extent it requires consent for disclosure of information for other medical conditions.  Any determination of the Medical Necessity of mental health services will be made in consultation with a licensed mental health professional. \n# \nNo legal action may be brought against the Plan based upon this Benefit Handbook, or related to benefits provided by the Plan, unless brought within two (2) years from the time the cause of action arises. \nThe Plan will not be liable to Subscribers for injuries, loss, or damage resulting from negligence, misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance, or malpractice on the part of any Provider, any Hospital, or any other institution or person providing health care services or supplies to any Subscriber."

This Benefit Handbook, the Schedule of Benefits, and the Prescription Drug Brochure will terminate unless renewed on the Anniversary Date. \n# \nThis legal document, including the Benefit Handbook, the Schedule of Benefits, and the Prescription Drug Brochure and any applicable riders or amendments which set forth the services covered by the Plan, the exclusions from coverage and the terms and conditions of coverage for Subscribers. \n# \nA Benefit Period is a way of measuring your use of services under Medicare Part A to determine Medicare coverage and your benefits under this Benefit Handbook.  A Benefit Period begins with the first day of a Medicare-covered inpatient Hospital stay and ends with the close of a period of 60 consecutive days during which you were neither an inpatient of a Hospital nor of a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF). Generally, you are an inpatient of a Hospital if you are receiving inpatient services in the Hospital.  The type of care actually received is not relevant.  However, for purposes of determining when a Benefit Period starts and ends, you are an inpatient of a Skilled Nursing Facility only when your care in the Skilled Nursing Facility meets certain skilled level of care standards established by the Medicare program. Please refer to the definition of \"Skilled Nursing Care.\" \n# \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program. \n# \nCost sharing amounts established by Medicare that Medicare beneficiaries must pay after any Medicare Deductible has been met.  Coinsurance is usually a percentage.  (For example, many services covered under Medicare Part B require beneficiaries to pay a $20\\%$ Coinsurance amount.)  As used in this Handbook, “Coinsurance” also includes fixed dollar amounts established by Medicare that Medicare beneficiaries must pay for certain services. \nThe Plan provides coverage for Medicare established Coinsurance amounts minus any Copayments required by the Plan. \n# \nCost sharing amounts established by the Plan that are payable by Subscribers for certain Covered Services under the Plan.  Copayments are usually fixed dollar amounts payable at the time services are rendered or when billed by the provider.  The Copayments that apply to the GIC’s coverage are listed in the Schedule of Benefits. \n# \nHealth care services or supplies for which benefits are provided under this Benefit Handbook.  Covered Services are described in Section III of this Benefit Handbook, the Schedule of Benefits and the Prescription Drug Brochure. \n# \nPersonal care that does not require the continuing attention of trained medical personnel.  Custodial Care services assist a person in activities such as mobility, dressing, bathing, eating, food preparation, including the preparation of special diets, and taking medications that usually can be self-administered. \n# \nA Deductible is a dollar amount that is payable each calendar year for Covered Services before benefits are available under an insurance plan.  The Plan provides coverage for Medicare Deductible amounts minus any Plan Deductibles or Copayments required by the Plan. Please see Medicare and You for information on Medicare’s Deductibles. \n# \nServices furnished for the care, treatment, removal or replacement of teeth or the structures directly supporting teeth. \n# \nEquipment that can withstand repeated use; is primarily and usually used to serve a medical purpose; is generally not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; and is appropriate for use in the home.  However, an institution may not be considered a Subscriber's home if it meets the basic requirements of a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.  Durable Medical Equipment includes items such as oxygen equipment, wheelchairs, hospital beds and other items that are determined to be Medically Necessary."

In some cases, providers may bill Medicare patients for amounts that exceed the Medicare-approved payment amount.  Any amount that exceeds the Medicare-approved amount is the Subscriber’s responsibility and is not payable either by Medicare or the Plan.  Please see the discussion of “assignment” in the Medicare publication Medicare and You for information on limits that apply to Provider charges. \nb. For Items Not Covered by Medicare.  If Medicare does not cover a product or service, the Payment Maximum depends upon whether the Provider is under contract to provide services to Subscribers of HPHC Insurance Company (HPIC).  If a Provider is under contract to HPIC, the Payment Maximum is the contract rate for the service.

        "text": "# \nP.O. Box 8747 Boston, Massachusetts 02114 \n# \nThis notice explains your COBRA rights and what you need to do to protect your right to receive it. You will receive a COBRA notice and application if the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) is informed that your current GIC coverage is ending due either to (1) end of employment, (2) reduction in hours of employment; (3) death of employee/retiree; (4) divorce or legal separation; or (5) loss of dependent child status.  This COBRA notice contains important information about your right to temporarily continue your health care coverage in the Group Insurance Commission’s (GIC’s) health plan through a federal law known as COBRA.  If you elect to continue your coverage, COBRA coverage will begin on the first day of the month immediately after your current GIC coverage ends.   \nYou must complete the GIC COBRA Election Form and return it to the GIC by no later than 60 days after your group coverage ends by sending it by mail to the Public Information Unit at the GIC at P.O. Box 8747, Boston, MA  02114 or by hand delivery to the GIC, 19 Staniford Street, $4^{\\mathtt{t h}}$ floor,  Boston, MA 02114.  If you do not submit a completed election form by this deadline, you will lose your right to elect COBRA coverage. \nWHAT IS COBRA COVERAGE?  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) is a federal law under which certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses and dependent children have the right to temporarily continue their existing group health coverage at group rates when group coverage otherwise would end due to certain life events, called ‘Qualifying Events.’ If you elect COBRA coverage, you are entitled to the same coverage being provided under the GIC’s plan to similarly situated employees or dependents. The GIC administers COBRA coverage. \nWHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR COBRA COVERAGE?  Each individual entitled to COBRA (known as a “Qualified Beneficiary”) has an independent right to elect the coverage, regardless of whether or not other eligible family members elect it.  Qualified Beneficiaries may elect to continue their group coverage that otherwise would end due to the following life events: \nIf you are an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or municipality covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage if \n You lose your group health coverage because your hours of employment are reduced; or  Your employment ends for reasons other than gross misconduct."

By law, COBRA coverage must begin on the day immediately after your group health coverage otherwise would end.  If your group coverage ends due to employment termination or reduction in employment hours, COBRA coverage may last for up to 18 months.  If it ends due to any other qualifying events listed above, you may maintain COBRA coverage for up to 36 months. \nIf you have COBRA coverage due to employment termination or reduction in hours, your  family members’ COBRA coverage may be extended beyond the initial 18-month period up to a total of 36 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if a second qualifying event – the insured’s death or divorce  - occurs during the 18 months of COBRA coverage.  You must notify the GIC in writing within 60 days of the second qualifying event and before the 18-month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage.   Your COBRA coverage may be extended to a total of 29 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if any qualified beneficiary in your family receiving COBRA coverage is disabled during the first 60 days of your 18-month COBRA coverage.  You must provide the GIC with a copy of the Social Security Administration’s disability determination within 60 days after you receive it and before your initial 18 month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage. \nCOBRA coverage will end before the maximum coverage period ends if any of the following occurs: \n The COBRA cost is not paid in full when due (see section on paying for COBRA);   \n You or another qualified beneficiary become covered under another group health plan that does not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion for the qualified beneficiary’s pre-existing covered condition covered by COBRA benefits;   \nYou are no longer disabled as determined by the Social Security Administration (if your COBRA coverage was extended to 29 months due to disability);   \n The Commonwealth of Massachusetts or your municipal employer no longer provides group health coverage to an of its employees; or   \n Any reason for which the GIC terminates a non-COBRA enrollee’s coverage (such as fraud). \nThe GIC will notify you in writing if your COBRA coverage is to be terminated before the maximum coverage period ends.  The GIC reserves the right to terminate your COBRA coverage retroactively if you are subsequently found to have been ineligible for coverage."

        "text": "HOW AND WHEN DO I ELECT COBRA COVERAGE?  Qualified beneficiaries must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of the date that their group coverage otherwise would end or within 60 days of receiving a COBRA notice, whichever is later.  A qualified beneficiary may change a prior rejection of COBRA election any time until that date.  If you do not elect COBRA coverage within the 60–day election period, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage. \nIn considering whether to elect COBRA coverage you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law, including the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a spouse’s plan) within 30 days after your GIC coverage ends due to a qualifying event. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of COBRA coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum time available to you. \nHOW MUCH DOES COBRA COVERAGE COST?  Under COBRA, you must pay $102\\%$ of the applicable cost of your COBRA coverage.  If your COBRA coverage is extended to 29 months due to disability, your cost will increase to $150\\%$ of the applicable full cost rate for the additional 11 months of coverage.  COBRA costs will change periodically; current COBRA rates are included with this notice. \nHOW AND WHEN DO I PAY FOR COBRA COVERAGE?  If you elect COBRA coverage, you must make your first payment for COBRA coverage within 45 days after the date you elect it.  If you do not make your first payment for COBRA coverage within the 45-day period, you will lose all COBRA coverage rights under the plan. \nYour first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time your coverage would have ended up to the time you make the first payment.  Services cannot be covered until the GIC receives and processes this first payment and you are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is enough to cover this entire period.  After you make your first payment, you will be required to pay for COBRA coverage for each subsequent month of coverage.  These periodic payments are due usually around the 15th of each month.  The GIC will send monthly bills, specifying the due date for payment and the address to which payment is to be sent for COBRA coverage, but you are responsible for paying for the coverage even if you do not receive a monthly statement. Payments should be sent to the GIC’s address on the bill. \nAfter the first payment, you will have a 30-day grace period beyond the due date on each monthly bill in which to make your monthly payment.  Your COBRA coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment.  If you fail to make a periodic payment before the end of the grace period for that payment, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage. \nCAN I ELECT OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE BESIDES COBRA?  Yes.  You have the right to enroll, within 31 days after coverage ends, in an individual health insurance ‘conversion’ policy with your current health plan without providing proof of insurability. Alternately, if you are a Massachusetts resident, you may purchase health insurance through the Commonwealth’s Health Connector Authority, or for employees in other states, through a Health Insurance Marketplace where available. The GIC has no involvement in conversion programs, and only very limited involvement in Health Connector programs.  You pay the premium to the plan sponsor for the coverage. The benefits provided under such a policy might not be identical to those provided through COBRA.  You may exercise this right in lieu of electing COBRA coverage, or you may exercise this right after you have received the maximum COBRA coverage available to you."

All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium.   \n2. The GIC has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by your plan is, on average for all participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare Part D drug plan. \n# \nou can join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each subsequent year from ctober $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ to December $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ . \nHowever, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan. \n# \nIf you enroll in another Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with or without prescription drug coverage, you will be disenrolled from the GIC-sponsored Harvard Pilgrm plan. If you are disenrolled from Harvard Pilgrim, you will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage. If you are the insured and decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan, both you and your covered spouse/dependents will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage. If you have limited income and assets, the Social Security Administration offers help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage. Help is available online at www.socialsecurity.gov or by phone at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778). \n# \nYou should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with a GIC plan and don’t join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later. \nIf you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least $1\\%$ of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least $19\\%$ higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay this higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have"

The ACA brought many benefits to Massachusetts and its residents, helping us expand coverage to more Massachusetts residents, making it more affordable for small businesses to offer their employees healthcare, and providing additional tools to help families, individuals and businesses find affordable coverage.  This notice is meant to help you understand health insurance Marketplaces, which are required by the ACA to make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the state Marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector. While you may or may not qualify for health insurance through the Health Connector, it may still be helpful for you to read and understand the information included here. \nOverview: There is an easy way for many individuals and small businesses in Massachusetts to buy health insurance: the Massachusetts Health Connector. This notice provides some basic information about the Health Connector, and how coverage available through the Health Connector relates to any coverage that may be offered by your employer.  You can find out more by visiting: MAhealthconnector.org, or for non-Massachusetts residents, Healthcare.gov or (1-800-318-2596; TTY: 1-855-889-4325). \nWhat is the Massachusetts Health Connector? The Health Connector is our state’s health insurance Marketplace. It is designed to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health insurance that meets their needs and fits their budget. The Health Connector offers \"one-stop shopping\" to easily find and compare private health insurance options from the state’s leading health and dental insurance companies. Some individuals and families may also qualify for a new kind of tax credit that lowers their monthly premium right away, as well as cost sharing reductions that can lower out-of-pocket expenses.  This new tax credit is enabled by $\\S268$ of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code. \nOpen enrollment for individuals and families to buy health insurance coverage through the Health Connector occurs every year.  You can find out more by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 1-877-MA ENROLL (1-877-623-6765). \nCan I qualify for federal and state assistance that reduces my health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses through the Health Connector? \nDepending on your income, you may qualify for federal and/or state tax credits and other subsidies that reduce your premiums and lower your out-of-pocket expenses if you shop through the Health Connector.  You can find out more about the income criteria for qualifying for these subsidies by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 1-877-MA ENROLL (1-877-623-6765)."

Also, please note that the amount that you and your employer contribute to your employer-sponsored health insurance is often excluded from federal and state income taxes.

To be eligible for GIC health insurance, a state employee must work a minimum of $18\\%$ hours in a 37.5 hour workweek or 20 hours in a 40 hour workweek. The employee must contribute to a participating GIC retirement system, such as the State Board of Retirement, a municipal retirement board, the Teachers Retirement Board, the Optional Retirement Pension System for Higher Education, a Housing, Redevelopment Retirement Plan, or another Massachusetts public sector retirement system (OBRA is not such a public retirement system for this purpose.  Visit www.mass.gov/gic or see your GIC Coordinator for more information. Temporary employees, contractors, less-than-half time part time workers, and most seasonal employees are not eligible for GIC health insurance benefits. These employees MAY shop for health insurance through the Health Connector and may be eligible for advanced premium federal tax credits and/or state subsidies if their gross family income is at or below $400\\%$ Federal Poverty Level (which is approximately $\\$46,000$ for an individual and $\\$94,000$ for a family of four).  Visit www.MAhealthconnector.org or call 1-877-MA-ENROLL for more information. \nIf there is any confusion around your employment status and what you are eligible for, please email HEALTHMARKETPLACENOTICE $\\@$ MASSMAIL.STATE.MA.US or contact your HR department or GIC Coordinator."
