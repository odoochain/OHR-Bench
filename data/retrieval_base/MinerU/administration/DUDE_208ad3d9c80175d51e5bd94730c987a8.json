        "text": "1. In the event that GSA declares BPR land adjacent to Headquarters site to be underutilized, three schemes are proposed for Agency use of a part of the property. Scheme Iis based on joint Agency-BPR utilization; Schemes II and IHl are based on the concept of the rough terrain reverting to Park Lands while the Agency acquires the portion contiguous with West Lot and Printing Services Building to effectively meet consolidation and security requirements. \n2. Scheme I requires acquisition of approximately 51 acres including the Parcel A land (West Parking Lot, 19.75 acres under use permit) inside the loop road, leaving approximately 310 acres of BPR land for other than Agency use. However, the Agency would wish to continue permission to use the area of the ball fields (about 30 acres) until it was needcd as a building site. Total gross new construction proposed is 1, 746,000 square feet plus parking for cars in 3 parking structures; of this total, 918,000 square feet and parkingfor cars would be constructed on the newly acquired property. \n3. Scheme II envisions acquisition of approximately 1l1 acres leaving 250 acres of BPR land for use as a park. Again, the Parcel B ball fields are not included in the 1ll acres, but Parcel A, West Lot, is included. The new boundary would fall 200 feet west of the existing BPR access road from Route 193 and continue inl a convex curve to the Agency gate at the parkway. A fourth entrance plus exit for rush hour use could be effected through the proposed park to the Turkey Run Road and onto the GW Parkway. \nTotal new construction proposed is 1,758,000 square feet plus parking on surface lots). Of the total new gross building area, 1, 143, 000 square feet plus the surface parking would be built on the newly acquired property. Such a scheme would leave the existing open feeling of Headquarters complex intact. \n4. Scheme IlI proposes the same design of access roads and building groups as Scheme IH with the addition of about 99 acres of open land to the west as a security buffer. This total acquisition of about 210 acres (including the ball fields) would leave 151 acres of hill and ravine land as an extension of Turkey Run Park. \nThe belt of open land would control the hilltops overlooking Agency facilities well satisfying security needs and simultaneously extend the park both visually and ecologically to that area devoted to park in Scheme I1. The inclusion of an improved heliport pad in the belt will not deny the above."
