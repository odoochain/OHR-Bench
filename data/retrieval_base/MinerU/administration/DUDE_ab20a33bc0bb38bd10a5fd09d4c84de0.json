We believe that a long-term commitment to the environment, and consideration of the effects of climate change, is an essential component of our work. To this end, the Wikimedia Foundation will: \n• Minimize our overall impact on the environment by seeking to reduce our global carbon footprint;   \n• Consider sustainability as a critical part of our decisions around how we plan our operations, travel, physical office use, and other procurements; Use green energy where it is available and financially feasible; Share sustainability information and lessons learned; and Perform and share an annual environmental impact assessment \n# \nEach year we calculate the carbon emissions associated with our buildings/facilities, workforce travel and commuting impacts and data servers.1 The resulting carbon footprint tells us in absolute metric tons how much greenhouse gas emissions we are responsible for in total. We also look at our relative carbon emissions to indicate how “carbon efficient” we are as we grow and evolve over time. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\nImpact & Methodology & 2018 & 2019 \\\\\nTotal carbon footprint & Total Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 tCO2-eq emissions for all functional areas & 2,571.37 & 2,374.43 \\\\\nOffice-related carbon footprint & tCO2-eq of San Francisco office (building+ commuting)/ #of SF-based employees andcontractors & 1.70 & 1.83 \\\\\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Product-related carbon footprint} & kgCO2-eqofdatacenteremissions/1Mpageviewson all languageWikipedias & 4.89 & 2.33 \\\\\n & kWh/1MpageviewsonalllanguageWikipedias & 11.89 & 10.78 \\\\\nTravel-relatedcarbonfootprint & tCO2-eq of travel(airtravel+hotels)/#ofevent attendeesforinternal convenings & 3.21 & 1.65 \\\\\nconvenings & tCO2-eqoftravel(airtravel+hotels)/#ofeventattendeesforcommunity & N/A & 2.10 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n1 In 2018, travel emissions were calculated based on actual number of trips, but estimated travel distances (grouped into “short, medium, and long” distance categories). In 2019, data tracking was improved to include actual mileage for travel, resulting in significantly higher quality results. We have recalculated air travel emissions for 2018 using this better methodology, and this Sustainability Impact Statement uses the restated 2018 carbon footprint results."

        "text": "# \nFrom 2018 to 2019, the Foundation’s carbon footprint decreased $7.66\\%$ overall. While the Foundation benefitted from significantly lower data center emissions $50.5\\%$ lower emissions than 2018), this improvement in data center efficiency was largely offset by an increase in travel emissions $33.44\\%$ higher emissions than 2018) as a result of $12\\%$ staff growth and additional events. \nIn 2019, air travel continued to be the main driver of carbon emissions ( $65.9\\%$ of emissions overall), split between travel related to convening remote staff for face-to-face meetings (i.e. “internal staff convenings” below), travel to/from events for the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimania (i.e. “community convenings” below) and miscellaneous business travel. Emissions related to data centers and servers continues to also be a highly significant driver of the overall carbon footprint $(23.7\\%$ of emissions overall).2 \nLooking ahead, we expect to see data center efficiency continuing to improve (although at a slower pace) through an increase of renewable energy use, a focus on water conservation and recycling, and overall equipment and building upgrades. The Foundation is currently looking at options for better managing air travel, noting that 2020 air travel emissions will be dramatically curtailed because of the COVID-19 travel restrictions. \nCarbon Footprint by Activity \nCarbon Footprint by Area"

        "text": "# \nIn 2019, the Foundation focused its efforts on getting a sustainability strategy in place and creating mechanisms to regularly share progress back with Foundation staff and Community members. In 2020, the focus will shift to piloting new protocols aimed at reducing air travel, enhancing virtual participation for Foundation events and meetings and diving more deeply into our most significant data centers and their environmental performance. \n• The Foundation continues to grow, year over year, in the numbers of staff that are located globally. The number of team offsites and global events are also slowly increasing, in order to meet with our community members to discuss wide ranging topics such as Movement Strategy.   \nAs the world continues to read more and more articles on Wikipedia and its sister projects, our servers and website performance must keep up with the increased load. We are investigating installing a new data center with a keen eye toward sustainable power resources. We are looking at ways to bring our community and Foundation staff together in more virtual events. For instance, we are running a few events, mostly virtual due to COVID-19, in 2020 to test out ways to make technical conferences more accessible to more people while limiting the amount of travel. \nAs with all the Foundation’s priorities, the impact of COVID-19 on our sustainability efforts cannot be overstated. By necessity, our air travel will be dramatically reduced, we will need to find ways to scale up virtual participation across the organization, and events will be postponed or cancelled until the crisis passes. In some cases, that will put a damper on our ability to implement sustainability goals. For example, it is impossible to enhance virtual participation options at Wikimania when Wikimania has been cancelled for 2020. In other cases, requirements to social distance mean we will be forced to get creative in finding ways to work together remotely. We will be looking for ideas, inspiration and lessons learned from this time to apply in a more structured way once the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, to ensure that virtual participation remains a viable way to interact with Foundation events going forward. \nWith a long history of a globally-distributed virtual team, the Foundation is well-placed to build on its remote workforce practices. The temporary closure of the Foundation’s office in San Francisco has not stopped the internal sustainability team from meeting together remotely, managing the 2019 carbon footprint calculations and implementing 2020 items on the sustainability roadmap. We are committed to moving forward with our long-term sustainability goals and will continue to share our progress."
