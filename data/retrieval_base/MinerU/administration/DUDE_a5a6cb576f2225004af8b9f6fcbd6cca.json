In comparison, an AR-15 round to the liver will literally pulverize it, much like dropping a watermelon onto concrete results in the destruction of the watermelon.” \nDr. Ernest E. Moore \n# \nAssault weapons are semi-automatic rifles with at least one military-style feature making the weapons easier to fire more accurately and rapidly than a typical hunting rifle. [See picture on the back] Seven states have banned the sale of assault weapons, allowing reasonable exemptions for law enforcement, military members, and shooting ranges.1 Multiple federal courts have upheld these public safety bans as constitutional.2 \n11X aA smsaausslt  shWoeoatpinogn st haraen  1a 1hx anmdogreu lni.k3 elWy htoe nb ea sussaeudlt  in weapons or high capacity magazines are used in a mass shooting, more than twice as many people are shot.4 \n7X Compared to any other firearm, an assault weapon is $7\\mathbf{x}$ more likely to kill law enforcement. A study analyzing FBI data showed that $20\\%$ of the law enforcement officers killed   \nin the line of duty from 1998 to 2001 were killed with assault weapons.5 \nLess than $2\\%$ of all Americans own assault weapons. \n\n3,251 sTecheo bnudl laent do fd ae li9vmerms  ah kainndegtiucn e tnrearvgeyls  oaft  410,20 0f0o foet ept opuenr ds. FPS By comparison, the standard AR-15 .223 caliber bullet travels at 3,251 feet per second and delivers 1300 foot pounds.7 Tissue destruction of the AR-15 is enhanced by cavitation – the destruction of tissue beyond the direct pathway of the bullet – caused by high velocity bullets with kinetic energies are over 2,500 foot pounds.8 \n# \nPrime Sponsors: Sen.
