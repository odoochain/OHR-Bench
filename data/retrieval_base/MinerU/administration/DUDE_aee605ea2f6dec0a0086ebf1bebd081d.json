        "text": "# \nThe problem of radiation hazards connected with the operation of x-ray diffraction and fluorescence analysis equipment has been a continuing one since the advent of such equipment. In 1946 Sectional Committee Z54 of the American Standards Association issued American War Standard Z54.1, “Safety Code for the Industrial Use of X-rays\" which included a section on x-ray diffraction units. \nIn 1967 the American Standards Association was superseded by the USA Standards Institute and Committee N43 was organized under the sponsorship of the National Bureau of Standards to replace Sectional Committee Z54. The scope of the new committee is “standards pertaining to products and equipment, for nonmedical scientific, industrial, and educational uses, involving ionizing radiation sources including radioactive materials, accelerators, and x-ray equipment but excluding nuclear reactors.\" \nThe responsibility to develop standards for x-ray diffraction and fuorescence analysis equipment was assigned to Subcommittee N43-1. \nRealizing that questions may arise from time to time concerning interpretations of this standard, provisions have been made for an Interpretations Committee in order that uniform handling of questionable cases may be provided. It is recommended that anyone using this standard and desiring an interpretation of a questionable case communicate with the American National Standards Institute. \nSuggestions for improvement gained in the use of this standard will be welcome.

        "text": "# \nThis standard reviews the types of injuries resulting from accidental exposure to ionizing radiation resulting from the operation of x-ray diffraction and fuorescence analysis equipment, establishes equipment design criteria, sets up requirements for approvedoperating procedures,andrecommendstheestablishmentofhealthsurveillance, and personnel monitoring programs. The circumstances under which operation of equipment must be limited to specially designated areas equipped with radiation barriers and warning signs are set forth. Maximum permissible dose limits established by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement are stated. A list of references to selected articles on various_aspects of radiation safety is given and notes on the detection andmeasurement ofradiation from x-raydiffraction andfluorescence analysis equipment areincluded in an appendix. \nKey words: Radiation safety; x-ray equipment. \n# \nThis standard provides guidelines specific to the radiation safety aspects of the design and operation of x-ray diffraction and fuorescence analysis equipment. It does not include electrical safety guidelines or other safety considerations outside the realm of radiation safety. \n# \nTerms used with special technical meanings or ones that are unique in the field are defined below. American National Standards Institute definitions [1]1 are used if available. Others are taken from publications of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements [2, 3]. \nControlled Area. A specified area in which exposure of personnel to radiation or radioactive material is controlled and which is under the supervision of a person who has knowledge of the appropriate radiation protection practices, including pertinent regulations, and who has responsibility for applying them (see 5.1.2). \nDistribution Factor, Dose (DF). A factor used in computing dose equivalent to account for the nonuniform distribution of internally deposited radionuclides. \n\nDose, Absorbed. The energy imparted to matter in a volume element by ionizing radiation divided by the mass of irradiated material in that volume element. The special unit of absorbed dose is the rad. One rad equals 100 ergs per gram. (Also commonly called dose.) \nDose Equivalent (DE). The product of absorbed dose, quality factor, dose distribution factor, and other modifying factors necessary to express on a common scale, for all ionizing radiations, the irradiation incurred by exposed persons. The special unit of dose equivalent is the rem. \nDose Rate, Absorbed. The absorbed dose per unit time. \nExposure. A measure of the ionization produced in air by x- or gamma-radiation. It is the sum of the electrical charges on all of the ions of one sign produced in air when all electrons liberated by photons in a volume element of air are completely stopped in the air, divided by the mass of the air in the volume elements. The special unit of exposure is the roentgen. \nExposure Rate. The exposure per unit time. Fail-safe Design. One in which all failures of indicator or safety components that can reasonably be anticipated cause the equipment to fail in a mode such that personnel are safe from exposure to radiation. For example: (a) if a light indicating “X-RAY ON\" fails, the production of x rays shall be prevented, and (b) if a shutter status indicator fails, the shutter shall close."

        "text": "In cases of accidental exposure, severe burns affecting the upper extremities of the body are the most frequently reported type of injury [4]. These are slow to heal and can lead to cancer. Amputation of one or more fingers is sometimes required [5]. Exposure of the lens of the eye to large doses can result in cataracts and other opacities [6]. Sometimes the damage does not become apparent until years later. Consideration must also be given to other injuries such as genetic damage affecting the future offsprings of irradiated persons. \n# \nStandards for maximum permissible doses of ionizing radiation are established by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)?, and by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)3. The current recommendations of the NCRP [7], which are the basis for the dose rate limits used in this standard, are summarized in table 1. Users of this standard should check with the NCRP at least once a year to obtain the latest recommendations. \nThe problem of correctly evaluating doses due to intense small-area beams of low energy x-ray photons is not trivial and results can easily be in error by an order of magnitude. An appendix, Detection and Measurement of Radiation from X-ray  Diffraction and  Fluorescence  Analysis Equipment, has been prepared as an aid in avoiding some of the pitfalls. \n# \n# \nThe three types of areas recognized in this standard, as well as the dose limits and barriers required, are indicated in fgure 1. \n# \n5.1.1.1 Designation of radiation area. Any area accessible to personnel in which there exists radiation at such levels that the whole body, head and trunk, active blood-forming organs, gonads, or lenses of the eyes could receive in any one hour a dose in excess of 5 mrems, or in any 5 consecutive days a dose in excess of 100 mrems shall be designated a radiation area. \n\n5.1.1.2 Occupancy. The occupancy of each radiation area shall be limited so that the accumulated dose received by the whole body, gonads, blood-forming organs, or lenses of the eyes does not exceed 5 rem in a year. \n5.1.1.3 System barrier. Each radiation area shall be surrounded by a system barrier with suffcient inherent shielding so that the dose equivalent received by individuals in the surrounding controlled area does not exceed 5 mrem in any one hour or 100 mrem in any 5 consecutivedays. \n# \nExposure of patients for medical and dental purposes is not included in the maximum permissible dose equivalent. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n & Maximum 13-week dose & Maximum yearly dose & Maximum accumulated dose \\\\\nControlledareas Whole body,gonads, lens ofeye,red bonemarrow & rem & rem\" & rem \\\\\nSkin（otherthan hands and forearms) & 3 & 5 15 & b5(N-18) \\\\\nHands & 25 & 75 \\\\\nForearms Otherorgans Noncontrolledareas & 10 5 & 30 15 0.5 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe numerical value of the dose equivalent in rems maybeassumedtobeequaltothenumericalvalue of the exposure in roentgens for the purpose of this report. ${}^{\\mathrm{b}}\\mathbf{N}{=}\\dot{\\mathrm{age}}$ in years and is greater than 18.

Each controlled area shall be visibly separated from adjacent noncontrolled areas by an installation enclosure with suffcient inherent shielding so that the dose equivalent received by individuals in the noncontrolled areas does not exceed 5o0 mrem in any year. \n5.1.2.3 Identifying sign. Each controlled area shall be identified by an appropriate and easily recognizable sign posted at each entrance. \n5.1.2.4 Supervision. Each controlled area should be under the supervision of a radiation protection officer. \n# \n5.1.3.1 Dose equivalent limit. The dose equivalent received by individuals in noncontrolled areas shall not exceed 500 mrem in any year. \n# \n5.2.1 Classification. X-ray systems for certain specific applications can be designed so that all possible x-ray beam paths are fully enclosed. However, operation requirements such as : \n(a) frequent changes of attachments and configuration,   \n(b)  a need for making adjustments with the x-ray beam on, and   \n(c） motion of specimen and detector over wide angular limits—-often make use of a fully enclosed system impractical. \nFor the purposes of this standard two classes of x-ray systems are recognized. They are designated Enclosed Beam X-ray Systems and Open Beam X-ray Systems. \n5.2.1.1 Enclosed beam c-ray system. An enclosed beam x-ray system is one in which all possible x-ray paths are fully enclosed according to the requirements of section 5.2.2.3. \n5.2.1.2 Open beam c-ray system. An x-ray system that does not comply with all of the requirements of section 5.2.2.3 shall be classified as an open beam x-ray system. \n# \n5.2.2.1 General requirements for all x-ray systems covered by this standard. \n5.2.2.1.1 The dose due to unwanted radiation from components such as high voltage rectifiers shall not exceed 10 mrem in a week in any accessible region 5 cm from the outside surface of the generator cabinet. Assuming that an individual may be in the vicinity of the equipment while it is operating for as long as 40 hours per week, the dose rate should not exceed 0.25 mrem/hr. \n5.2.2.1.2 The x-ray accessory apparatus shall include a beam trap or other barrier with sufficient shielding so that the dose rate due to the transmitted primary beam does not exceed 0.25 mrem/hr under normal operating conditions. The dose rate may be difficult to evaluate in the presence of scattered radiation, and in the case of x-ray tube sources this requirement shall be considered met if the inherent shielding of the trap or barrier is at least equivalent to the thickness of lead specified in table 2 for the maximum rated anode current and potential. In the case of isotope sources the required barrier thickness should be deterimined by a qualified expert. \nTABLE 2.

The upper limit for the energy of x-ray photons is, therefore, 50 or $100\\mathrm{keV}.$ . There is no theoretical lower limit to the energy of the photons in the white radiation continuum, but the intensity below about $5~\\mathrm{keV}$ is low and the xrays are readily attenuated. The continuum can be assumed to extend from 5 to $100~\\mathrm{keV}$ with an intensity maximum in the range 20 to $30~\\mathrm{keV}$ depending on the accelerating potential. \nSuperimposed on this continuum are the lines of the characteristic spectrum of the anode. These constitute less than half of the output in the case of tubes used for diffraction. The energies involved are generally in the range 5.4 to $17.5\\mathrm{keV}$ \nIn order to measure the dose from both the continuum and the characteristic spectrum a survey meter should have energy absorption characteristics  similar  to  air  throughout  the energy range 5 to $100~\\mathrm{keV}$ \n# \nHazardous radiation may come from the following sources ([12], p. 6-2) : \n1. The primary beam.   \n2. Leakage or scatter of the primary beam through cracks in ill ftting or defective equipment.   \n3. Penetration of the primary beam through the tube housing, shutters or diffraction apparatus.   \n4. Secondary emission from the sample or other material exposed to the primary beam.   \n5. Diffracted rays.   \n6. Radiation generated by rectifiers in the high-voltage power supply. \n\nThe primary beam is most hazardous because of the extremely high exposure rates. Exposure ratesof $4~\\times~10^{5}$ R/min at the port have been reported for ordinary diffraction tubes [4]. \nThe leakage or scatter of the primary beam through apertures in ill fitting or defective equipment can produce  very high intensity beams of possibly small and irregular cross section. \nDiffracted beams also tend to be small and irregular in shape. They may be directed at almost any angle with respect to the main beam, and occasionally involve exposure rates of the orderof $80\\mathrm{R/hr}$ for short periods. \nThe hazard resulting from penetration of the useful beam through shutters or the x-ray tube housing is slight in well designed equipment. Adequate shielding is easily attained at the energies commonly used for diffraction and fuorescence analysis. \nRadiation from the high voltage power supply may result from gassy rectifiers. The effective potential is twice the potential applied to the x-ray tube, and the radiation is very penetrating. This condition can arise at any time and the only effective countermeasure is to shield the assembly that contains the rectifiers and check at least twice a year for radiation leakage. \n# \nOne of the major problems in carrying out a radiation survey program is to obtain a detector with good energy independence at very low photon energies ([13], p. 105-127)."

        "text": "The type of  instrument generally recommended for accurate measurements of exposure rates at low x-ray energies is an ionization chamber with a thin $\\mathrm{1.0~mg/cm^{2}}$ )plastic window. Calibration corrections may be required at low x-ray photon energies( $<~6.5~\\mathrm{keV}.$ ，butthese energies are an important part of the spectrum only when an iron or chromium anode is used. \nIn general, for the accuracy required in radiation protection surveys, no corrections are required so long as the whole sensitive area of the detector is in a uniform radiation field. In this connection, the relatively large size of the ionization chamber $31/2$ inch diameter for a typical survey instrument) must be listed as a disadvantage of this type of instrument because of the resulting low sensitivity when used in searching for beams of small cross section. \nInstruments  which  count  individual  x-ray photons (Geiger counters, scintillation detectors, Si (Li) detectors) offer high sensitivity in a small cross section, and are generally superior to ionization chambers for detecting beams of small cross section. The response is generallyvery energy dependent and the readings must be interpreted with care. Readings obtained with a Geiger counter in the soft x-ray range are particularly unreliable. However, the primary need is to find and mechanically eliminate small beams by adding shields or correcting unsatisfactory assembly methods. The use of the simpler counters for this purpose is quite acceptable. \n# \nA4.1 Instrumental methods. An instrument which is calibrated for radiation that exposes the entire active area uniformly will give an erroneously low reading when exposed to a beam having a smaller area ([13], p. 155-162), and the scale reading must be multiplied by a factor. \n$$\nf=\\frac{\\mathrm{Areaofdetector}}{\\mathrm{Areaofbeam}}\n$$\nBeams as small as $0.01~\\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ are commonly encountered around single crystal diffraction apparatus and correction factors of 6oo0 or more may be required for a $3\\%$ -inch diameter ionization chamber. In such cases it becomes difficult to detect beams in which the dose rate may be hundreds of times greater than permissible. \n\nTo resolve this difficulty in connection with the detection and measurement of $_\\mathrm{x}$ -radiation from color television receivers 4 the NCRP has allowed for the fact that the smaller the beam the less is the likelihood that the same area of an individual will be repeatedly or continuously exposed. The standard for home television receivers permits the dose rate to be averaged over an area of 10 square centimeters. The same practice is acceptable for surveys around x-ray generator cabinets and system barriers, but in the vicinity of x-ray tube housings, beam ports, collimators, and specimen chambers where small, intense beams are likely to be encountered, it is recommended that the area over which the dose rate is averaged be limited to $\\mathrm{1cm^{2}}$ \nOn this basis it may be assumed that the largest correction factor that will need to be applied will be numerically equal to the sensitive area of the detector in square centimeters. In general, \n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{X}=\\dot{X}_{\\mathrm{scale}}~\\mathrm{for}~A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~beam}}>A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~detector}}}}\\ {{\\dot{X}=\\displaystyle\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~detector}}}{A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~beam}}}~\\dot{X}_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~scale}}\\mathrm{for}1\\mathrm{cm^{2}}<A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~beam}}<A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~detector}}}}\\ {{\\dot{X}=\\displaystyle\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~detector}}}{1~\\mathrm{cm^{2}}}~\\dot{X}_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~scale}}\\mathrm{for}A_{\\mathrm{\\tiny~beam}}<1\\mathrm{cm^{2}}}}\\end{array}\n$$\nwhere $X$ is the exposure rate and $A$ is the area. A4.2 Film methods. X-ray film in a low absorption opaque envelope is a useful adjunct to the survey meter in searching for radiation leaks. This method often gives recognizable shadows of features of the x-ray equipment that effectively locate the leak.An estimate of the cross section of the beam can be obtained for use in correcting readings of a survey meter, or the film method itself can be made to give a quantitative estimate of the dose if calibration data are available ([13], p. 185-212). An additional advantage of the film is its suitability for integrating over a long period in order to detect very weak beams and to give an indication of the dose averaged over a period of time that includes all the steps of a given procedure. The latter sometimes leads"
