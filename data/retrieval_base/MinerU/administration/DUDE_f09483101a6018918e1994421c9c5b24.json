        "text": "# \n# \nIt is my honor and privilege to report the accomplishments of the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) for the year 2012. The FPA as a regulatory agency continues to strive for quality services for its clientele, true to its mandate in making available fertilizer and pesticide for the use of farmers in food production to achieve the twin goals of food sufficiency and food security. \nThe year 2012 was a challenging year for FPA as it carried its plans and strategies in pursuit of our mission brought forth with the implementation of the Rationalization Program that brought mixed reactions of optimism and apprehensions in the agency. Despite these reactions, FPA vigorously pursued its mandate. \nWe are happy to report that our field personnel although limited in number were able to enforce the rules provided under PD 1144 and apprehend violators particularly those involved in the adulteration of fertilizer, andthesaleof unregistered/smuggled pesticides. Our strong linkage with the Philippine National Police, Department of Justice, National Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Customs, the Fertilizer Industry Association of the Philippines, and the pesticide industry associations (CPAP, CROPLIFE and PICMA) has proven very effective on its enforcement of the rules. \nThe operationalization of the FPA fertilizer analytical laboratory has indeed been an effective tool in the analysis of the confiscated fertilizer that provided material evidences in the investigation of adulterated fertilizers. The laboratory is also a great help in confirmatory analysis of samples  from registrants and those samples gathered during the monitoring of the FPA field personnel. \nWe are happy to report that the Bluebook which is the Fertilizer Implementing Guidelines has been finalized and will be available for distribution in the early part of 2013. We thank our fertilizer consultants, fertilizer industry, the FPA staff who have been involved in the formulation of the Bluebook for their contribution \nWe took pride also for the commendation of the FPAbythe Bureau ofCustoms inthe implementation of the  Philippine National Single Window which was a showcase of success to other countries.The PNSW has facilitated import permit transactions of FPA licensed importers of fertilizer and pesticide products shortening the processing time. \n\n\nOur   accomplishment   cannot   be realized without the cooperation and support of the stakeholders. The FPA thank them for their unwavering support. I believe that there is no compromise when it comes to the importance of our stakeholders since they are our partners in agriculture in making fertilizer and pesticide available to Filipino farmers. \nThe FPA is not spared of challenges but with the commitment, cooperation and enthusiasm of each of its employee, they can be responded accordingly. \nIn 2014, we look forward to improve theagency's servicesthrough capacity building-staff development and logistical support. In the light of the implementation of the Rationalization Program, we are optimistic that we will be able to streamline and improve our regulatory services provided that we have the right people in the right position to do the work. We look forward also to the operationalization of our Pesticide Analytical Laboratory and our international role and commitment such as the ASEAN harmonization of  the MRL and  pesticide regulations. \nMore power to all of us!"

FPA continues to give the farmers and the consuming public an array of registered quality  fertilizer and pesticide products in accordance to their needs. \nFertilizer and pesticide product quality standards is one of the main concern of the Authority. On this context, the FPA has operationalizedthe Fertilizer Analytical Laboratory Services. Fertilizer laboratory that caters to all for guaranteed analysis of product samples submitted by clients prior to product registration and license approval, and for  quality monitoring. The establishment of the Pesticide Laboratory is on-going and will soon be operationalized. The laboratory equipment have already been purchased, ready for installation as soon as the electrical and other facilities have been completed."

For the year 2012, a total of 690 fertilizer samples were received, 548 samples coming from clients for registration purposes and 142 samples from field personnel for product quality standard monitoring. Out of the 690 samples received, there were 635 fertilizer laboratory results released and 1,779 fertilizer parameters analyzed. Also, there were 31 adulterated fertilizer samples received from regional offices which were analyzed by the laboratory as part of the evidences by the Philippine National Police (PNP)-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), and Department of Justice used in the case against the violators. \n\n\n# \nAs a primary regulatory mandate of FPA, different types of fertilizer and pesticide product applications have been processed and registered and made available to the farmers. \nThe fertilizer product registration posted $104\\%$ accomplishment, 494 fertilizer products were approved: \n263 new applications   \n231 product registration for renewal \nFor pesticide product registration, there were 1,098 products approved which is $127\\%$ accomplishment over its target of 863. \n# \nThere were 928 applications for registration of fertilizer and pesticide warehouses approved: \n214 fertilizer warehouses 68 pesticide warehouses TMENT OFACRICULTY A total of 646 warehouses were processed and approved at the regional level.. \n# \nAs a requirement foregistration of fertizer and pesticide productsthere were 819 Experimental Use Permits (EUP) approved: \n171 approved EUP for fertilizer   \n648 approved EUP for pesticide"

The FPA field personnel vigilantly conducted monitoring activities, inspection visits to fertilizer and pesticide handlers. \n\nThere were 281 clean-up drives conducted in the regions and provinces. As a result, there were 645 establishments found to have violated FPA rules and \nregulations.  Consequently, 19 establishments of whom were given the corresponding “Stop Sales, Stop Use, Stop Move Order (SUMs) and were imposed appropriate sanctions. \nThere were 544 Pest Control Operators (PCOs), and 235 establishments using pesticide impregnated plastics monitored and inspected for the year 2012. \nIn line with the occupational health and safety monitoring on fertilizer and pesticide production, there were seven (3) fertilizer, and fort four (44 pesticide  plants  visited as requirement  for  registration pos registration/licensing."
