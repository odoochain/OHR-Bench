        "text": "# \n# \nThis Member Handbook describes your benefits as a Member of Health New England, Inc. (“HNE” or “the Plan”). It tells you what health care services and supplies HNE covers and how to get them. It is set up to help you find the information you need to know quickly and easily. The Table of Contents lists each section and where it is located. At the beginning of each section is a shaded box, containing a summary of the most important things to know about that section. We have provided the detail of each bulleted item in the text below the shaded box. Certain words in this Member Handbook that begin with a capital letter have a special meaning. These words are defined in the “Definitions” section of this Member Handbook. \nIf you have any questions, please call us. For your convenience, HNE’s telephone numbers appear at the bottom of each page, along with our website. Our Member Services Representatives are available Monday through Friday, from $8{:}00~\\mathrm{a.m}$ . to $6{:}00\\mathrm{p.m}$ . \n# \nHealth New England is a Massachusetts licensed Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). An HMO is a health plan that requires you to get your care from specific doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers that contract with the Plan. We call these providers “In-Plan Providers.” \nHNE In-Plan Providers are independent contractors. HNE does not control the methods In-Plan Providers use to perform their work or to provide services. To find out what hospitals, doctors, and providers are in the HNE network, please refer to your “Plan Provider Directory,” call HNE Member Services, or check the HNE website. Printed Provider Directories are updated annually and from time to time throughout the year and are available upon request. Our website is updated weekly. Please note that In-Plan Providers may have left or joined the Plan Provider network since the time of the last update. Because providers are free to join and leave our network at any time, HNE cannot guarantee the continued participation of any specific provider or group of providers listed in our Directory. The HNE Service Area consists of these Massachusetts counties: Hampden, Hampshire, Franklin, Berkshire, and Worcester County. \nWith HNE, your monthly premium covers a large array of medical services, including preventive care when you are healthy and care when you are injured or sick. When you receive care from In-Plan Providers, you will not have to submit claim forms or pay bills. However, you do have payment responsibilities as explained below. \nHealth care is covered only when Medically Necessary and appropriate. Your Primary Care Provider must provide or arrange your care, except when otherwise stated in this Member Handbook. \n# \nFor some services, you are responsible for meeting a Deductible before the Plan pays benefits. If you have individual coverage, you must meet the individual Deductible before the Plan begins paying benefits for those services. If you have family coverage (even just one person other than yourself), your family must satisfy the family Deductible before the Plan begins paying benefits for those services. However, once any member of the family pays the individual Deductible amount towards the family Deductible, the Plan will begin paying benefits for that family member, even if the family Deductible has not yet been met."

If the Deductible applies to that service, you must pay the difference between your Copay or Coinsurance amount and the amount of Health New England’s contracted payment to the provider until the Policy Year Deductible is satisfied.. If the Deductible does not apply to a service, you will only be responsible for your Copay or Coinsurance, if any, for that service. Your Plan has three Copays levels (Tiers) for services from certain specialists. \nThe Plan has an Out-of-Pocket Maximum that includes the Deductible, Coinsurance and Copays for all in-network medical services including pharmacy, and behavioral health. Once you have met this Out-of-Pocket Maximum, you will not have to pay Copays or Coinsurance for those services for the rest of the Year. Other limits on the number of Copays per year you pay for inpatient admissions and outpatient surgery are explained in the “Covered Benefits” section of this Member Handbook. \nThe Chart of Benefits that starts on page 12 has specific information about your Deductible, Copays, Coinsurance and Out-of-Pocket Maximum. \n# \nHNE now has a way for you to get information on estimated costs for health care services. You can also get an estimate of what you will pay for those services. Available information includes: \n The estimated or maximum allowed amount or charge for a proposed admission, procedure or service. The estimated amount you will be responsible to pay for a proposed admission, procedure, or service. This includes any Deductible, Copay, Coinsurance, facility fee or other amount you pay. This will be based on the information HNE has at the time the request is made. The service must be a Medically Necessary covered benefit. \nIf you then receive the health care services subject to the estimate, you will not be required to pay more than the estimated amount for Member responsibility. However, if unforeseen services arise out of the proposed admission, procedure or service, you may have additional Cost Sharing as required by your HNE plan. \nTo get cost estimates for health care services you can: \n· Call Member Services toll free at (800) 310-2835. TTY/TDD users call (800) 439-2370. Email us at memberservices $@$ hne.com.   \n Go to my.HealthNewEngland.org and log on as a Member. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "# \nYou must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP).   \nIf you need care, call your PCP.   \nThere are three levels (or Tiers) of Copays for services from certain specialists.   \nYou do not need a referral for specialty care from In-Plan Providers.   \nAlways show your HNE ID Card when receiving services.   \nIn an Emergency, you may go straight to the emergency room (ER). If there is time, call your PCP first.   \nIf you do not follow the rules described in this Member Handbook, you may lose all or part of your coverage for that service or supply. \n# \nCentered Care is a program that seeks to improve health care coordination and quality while reducing costs. Primary Care Providers play a critical role in helping their patients get the right care at the right place with the right provider. The central idea is to coordinate health care services around the needs of you – the patient. Because health care is so expensive, Centered Care also seeks to engage providers and health plans on managing these dollars more efficiently. \n# \n1. PCP designation: Your plan keeps track of who your Primary Care Provider (PCP) is. Primary Care Providers include physicians with specialties in internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics, and nurs practitioners and physician assistants. PCP engagement: Your PCP helps coordinate your care.   \n3. Data sharing: Electronic medical records provide secure access to your health history, prescriptions, lab results and appointments to help your PCP and other providers keep track of your medical needs and make sure they are met.   \n4. Low cost providers encouraged:  You have incentives for choosing low cost, high quality specialists and hospitals.  Your PCP and health plan will help you find the appropriate providers. Expanded hours and urgent care access:  Your providers will have expanded hours, including some evenings and weekend appointments making it more convenient for you with off hour urgent care needs.   \n6. High level care for the chronically ill: If you have a chronic condition, your PCP will monitor and advise you all year long.   \n7. Disease management: Your health plan will identify patients at risk for complications and will help you, your PCP and your other providers navigate your care and find out about best practices.   \n8. Group visits: Patients with similar conditions may sometimes meet together with their providers.  Office visits for small groups of patients including education, promotion of self-management, group interaction, support and direct patient-practitioner encounters. These types of visits include wellness programs for patients with weight-related issues, diabetes, or low back pain.   \n9. Transitional care management: When you are released from the hospital to rehab or home, your treatment plan and medications accompany you.   \n10. Essential reporting package:  Your health plan will help providers to help you by giving them timely reports on patients, their fellow physicians, and best practices."

        "text": "# \nChoosing a PCP is the first and most important decision you must make when you join HNE. Your PCP is the first person you should call when you need medical care. A PCP may be a doctor, a participating Pediatric, Adult or Family Nurse Practitioner or a participating Physician Assistant (PA). You may choose a different PCP for each member of your family. HNE’s Provider Directory lists PCPs, their locations, and phone numbers. You can get a copy of our Provider Directory by calling HNE Member Services, or visit our website. \nIf you choose a PCP that you have not seen before, we suggest you do the following: \nCall your PCP’s office as soon as possible and tell the staff you are a new HNE Member.   \nMake an appointment to see your new PCP so he or she can get to know you and begin taking care of any of your medical needs. You do not have to wait until you are sick to make this appointment. You should get to know your doctor as soon as possible.   \nAsk your previous doctor(s) to send your medical records to your new PCP. \nYou must choose a PCP so that HNE can process your claims for benefits correctly. We will notify you in writing if your PCP stops being an In-Plan Provider. You will then need to select a new PCP. Please note that HNE does not cover services that you receive from an In-Plan PCP who is not listed by HNE as your PCP or your PCP’s covering doctor. \n# \nYou can change your PCP by calling our Member Services Department. PCP changes will be effective on the next business day after your request. You may change to any PCP, unless the newly chosen doctor has notified HNE that he or she is no longer accepting new patients. \n# \nYes. Your PCP may request that you transfer to another In-Plan Doctor. HNE does not allow transfers based on the amount of medical services required by a Member or the physical condition of a Member. Your PCP must ask for HNE’s approval before requesting a transfer to a new PCP. Your PCP must send you a letter requesting that you choose another PCP. \n# \n# \nCall your PCP. It is your PCP’s duty to provide or arrange most of your medical care. The services you receive must be Medically Necessary. Care by Out-of-Plan Providers must be approved, in advance, by HNE. \n# \nYes. You must present your HNE ID Card to receive services. Your ID Card provides important information, such as: HNE’s mailing address and telephone number; Subscriber name; Group number; benefit plan, including some Copay amounts; identification number; as well as the name, and Member number of each person covered. Having an ID Card does not guarantee you coverage for services. To receive Covered Services, you must be an HNE Member at the time you receive the service. If you permit others to use your ID Card to obtain services to which they are not entitled, your coverage may end. You should report the loss or theft of your ID Card to HNE as soon as possible. You may only use the most recent card provided to you by HNE. \n# \nAt HNE, we know that medical problems may occur at any time — day or night. That is why we ask our PCPs to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You should talk to your PCP to find out about arrangements for care after normal business hours. At times, you may reach your PCP’s answering service. You may also reach the doctor who is on call for your PCP. If you reach an answering service, here is what to do: \n1. Say that you are an HNE Member   \n2. Give your name and phone number \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

Just make your appointment, present your HNE ID card, and pay your usual Copay. See “Important Information about Copay Tiers” on page 6. \nTo find out about obtaining mental health or substance abuse services, see “How to Get Mental Health or Substance Abuse Services” later in this section. \nIt is your responsibility to make sure that any doctor you see on recommendation from your PCP is an HNE In-Plan Doctor. If you are not sure, check the Plan Provider Directory, visit the HNE website, or call HNE. \n# \nHNE does not cover routine foot care, such as care of corns, calluses, and trimming of nails, unless you are a diabetic. However, other covered podiatry services, such as the treatment of podiatric diseases and conditions, are available from an In-Plan podiatrist. For additional information, see the “Exclusions and Limitations” section of this Member Handbook. \n# \nFor non-Emergency care, talk to your PCP or treating In-Plan Provider. If you need to be admitted to a hospital, your PCP or treating In-Plan Provider will make the necessary hospital arrangements and supervise your care. Except in Emergencies, your treating In-Plan Provider must get HNE’s Prior Approval before admitting you to an Out-of-Plan hospital. \n# \nSome HNE services are free of charge. For most services, however, you pay a set dollar amount. This is called a Copay. For some services you pay a percentage of the total payment to the provider.  This is called Coinsurance. Copays and Coinsurance are listed in the “Covered Benefits” section of this Member Handbook. Also, see “Important Information about Copay Tiers” on page 6. Please remember that, in general, you must pay any Copays at the time you receive services. Some services are subject to a Deductible. Other than Copays, Coinsurance and the Deductible, In-Plan Providers cannot bill you for Covered Services. If you do not understand a bill you get from an In-Plan Provider for a Covered Service that you received, please call HNE’s Member Services Department. \n# \nFor In-Plan Providers, you do not have to submit claims to HNE. In-Plan Providers do this for you. If you receive services from an Out-of-Plan Provider, show your HNE ID Card. Most providers will bill HNE directly. If possible, ask the Out-of-Plan Provider to submit a standard medical claim form to HNE. \nWithin 45 days of when we get the claim, HNE will: \nPay the Out-of-Plan Provider  If we do not pay the claim, tell the Out-of-Plan Provider the reason for non-payment Ask the provider in writing for any additional information we need to pay the claim \nIf HNE doesn’t do one of these within 45 days, we will pay interest to the provider. This interest is in addition to any reimbursement for health care services provided.  Interest will accrue beginning 45 days after HNE received the request for reimbursement. Interest applied will be at the rate of $1.5\\%$ per month, not to exceed $18\\%$ per year. Interest payments will not apply to a claim that HNE is investigating because of suspected fraud. \nIf the provider will not bill HNE directly, you must send us an itemized bill. The bill must include the diagnosis and the date of treatment. For foreign medical bills and for some providers in the U.S., you may have to pay the provider. If you pay the bill, send HNE: \n Proof of payment  A copy of the bill \nMember Handbook HNE/GICactive-16 \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "We will repay you for Covered Services, less any Copay and Deductible amounts. \nIf you get Emergency care in a foreign country, have the bills translated into English. The bill must also be converted to U.S. dollar values as of the date of service. \n# \nThere are different levels (or tiers) of Copays for office visits with specialist physicians. You pay a Copay amount based on the tier assignment of the doctor you visit. Tier assignments are included in the provider listings in the HNE Provider Directory. Providers in the following specialties are placed into one of three tiers: Cardiology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Orthopaedic Surgery, Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose and Throat doctors), Pulmonology, and Rheumatology. For providers with specialties not listed above you pay a $\\$60$ Copay. \n# \nHNE assigned doctors to tiers based on each doctor’s quality, and/or cost-efficiency scores. Provider quality is the quality of care provided by physicians based on compliance with nationally established clinical guidelines compared to peers in the same medical specialty. HNE determines provider quality using objective measures of quality, based on national standards and developed by Resolution Health, Inc (a vendor to the Group Insurance Commission). Cost-efficiency measures a physician compared to his or her peers within the same specialty, in terms of average resource use for managing the same set of conditions. In other words, are patients getting more services than they need, fewer services than they need, or just the right amount? Using three years of claims data from all six of the GIC’s health plans in Massachusetts, ViPS (a vendor to the Group Insurance Commission) developed an efficiency score for each physician HNE tiered. \nProviders in the following six specialties were assigned to a Tier based on both provider quality and cost-efficiency: Cardiology, Endocrinology, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Otolaryngology, Pulmonology, and Rheumatology. Providers in these three specialties were assigned to a Tier based only on cost-efficiency: Gastroenterology, Surgery, and Orthopaedic Surgery. \nEach individual specialist is assigned to a Tier independently. In other words, two doctors within the same specialty who work in the same office together may be assigned to different Tiers. The Copay that you pay for services is based on the Tier assignment of the specialist who provides them. For example, you regularly see a cardiologist who is a Tier 1 physician. This physician is not available for one of your appointments, and you are seen by another cardiologist in the same office who is a Tier 2 physician. You will pay a Tier 2 Copay for the services you receive from the Tier 2 physician at this appointment. \nThe HNE Provider Directory includes each specialist’s Tier assignment. \\*\\*\\* Tier 1 (excellent) – Copay will be $\\$30$ \\*\\* Tier 2 (good) – Copay will be $\\$60$ \\* Tier 3 (standard) – Copay will be $\\$90$ \nPlease note that a physician can have more than one specialty. In that case, the Tier assignment will be assigned based on the physician’s primary specialty. \nSometimes HNE does not have enough information about provider quality and/or cost-efficiency to assign a Copay Tier to a specialist with one of the specialties listed above. In that case, the specialist Copay will be $\\$60$ . Tier assignments are not applied to all specialties, only to those listed above. For a specialist who is not in one of the specialties listed above, the specialist Copay will be $\\$60$ . \nPrior to July $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ each year, HNE will review the Tier status of contracted providers using the criteria above. Changes to Tier status will take effect on July $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ of that year. You can get information on a specialist’s Tier assignment by calling HNE Member Services at (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370) or via the HNE website at healthnewengland.org. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "What if I need to receive specialty care that is not available from an In-Plan Provider? At HNE, we want you to get the right care in the right place at the right time. \nWe contract with a broad network of providers. Most of the time, the care you need will be available locally. Sometimes, however, you may need care outside of the HNE network. For example, if you need highly specialized care that is not available from In-Plan Providers, your doctor may request to send you to an Out-of-Plan Provider. \nAt times like this, we can help. Our Member Services Department can get you going in the right direction. Simply contact Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370). Our staff will tell you if you can get the right care close to home. If not, we will explain what you need to do to get the services you need. \nIn order to be covered by HNE for specialty care from an Out-of-Plan Provider, you must first have the approval of HNE. In general, most health care services can be provided by HNE In-Plan Providers. Therefore, before HNE will consider a request for you to see an Out-of-Plan Provider, you must first have your PCP refer you to an In-Plan Provider. If there is no In-Plan Provider available to treat you, your PCP or treating In-Plan Provider will work with HNE to identify an appropriate Out-of-Plan Provider to treat you. \nTo initiate this process, your PCP or treating In-Plan Provider must submit a Prior Approval Request Form to HNE. HNE will notify you and your doctor in writing of its decision to approve or not approve the services from an Outof-Plan Provider. If you have not received a response from HNE, you should call HNE to determine whether HNE has approved your request. You should not make an appointment with the Out-of-Plan Provider before you receive HNE’s response. Please note: HNE does not verify the credentials of Out-of-Plan Providers. Only In-Plan Providers go through HNE’s credentialing process. \n# \nIf you have paid for Covered Services from an Out-of-Plan Provider and want to be reimbursed, you must submit a claim to HNE. To submit a claim you must use a “Member Reimbursement Medical Claim Form.” Instructions for submitting a claim are on the Claim Form. To get a Claim Form, visit healthnewengland.org or call Member Services. \nClaims for member reimbursement for services from Out-of-Plan providers must be received by HNE within one year from the date of the services. Member Cost Sharing will apply to services from Out-of-Plan providers. \nHNE may require you to supply documents that show the services you received were Medically Necessary and/or Covered Services under your plan. If HNE determines that the services you received were not Covered Services or were not Medically Necessary, we may deny coverage. If HNE denies coverage, you will be responsible for the cost of the services. \nPlease note:  You are covered for services from Out-of-Plan Providers only in an emergency or when you have Prio Approval from HNE for the services."

        "text": "# \nMassachusetts law defines an “Emergency” as follows: \nAn emergency is a medical condition, whether physical or mental, manifesting itself by symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that the absence of prompt medical attention could reasonably be expected by a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, to result in placing the health of the insured or another person in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to body function, or serious dysfunction of any body organ or part, or, with respect to a pregnant woman, as further defined in section 1867(e)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. section 1395dd(e)(1)(B). \nStated simply, an Emergency is a medical condition that you believe will place your life or health in serious danger if you do not receive immediate medical attention. In an Emergency, go to the nearest emergency facilities, call 911, or call your local emergency number. You are always covered for care in an Emergency. Your Primary Care Provider will arrange for any follow-up care you may need. Some problems are Emergencies because, if not treated promptly, they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Other problems are Emergencies because they are potentially life-threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisoning, inability to breathe, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, and severe trauma. What all Emergencies have in common is a serious threat to health and the need for quick action. \nRoutine care, care that is not required immediately, or care of minor illnesses or injuries are not Emergencies. Examples of routine care or minor illnesses that are not Emergencies are: colds, minor sore throats, injuries of more than 24 hours' duration, or persistent or chronic illness treatable by your PCP. \nAll Members have the opportunity to obtain health care services for an Emergency Medical Condition. This includes the options of going to the nearest emergency facility, calling the local pre-hospital emergency medical service system, or dialing the emergency telephone access number (911), or its local equivalent, whenever you are confronted with an Emergency Medical Condition which, in the judgment of a prudent layperson, would require prehospital Emergency services. \nNo Member will be discouraged in any way from using emergency facilities, local pre-hospital emergency medical service systems, or the 911 telephone number, or the local equivalent. \nNo Member will be denied coverage for medical and transportation expenses incurred as a result of any Emergency Medical Condition which meets the above conditions. \n# \nYou always have coverage for care in an Emergency. You do not need a referral from your PCP. However, in all cases, if your situation allows, call your PCP first. Say that you are an HNE Member and clearly state your symptoms. Your PCP may ask you to go to an emergency room or ask you to visit a doctor's office. Your PCP or a covering doctor is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nIf you do not have time to call your PCP, follow these rules: \nWhen an Emergency Occurs: \n Seek medical care at once.  Go to the nearest emergency room (ER) or dial “911”.  (If two hospitals are equally close, use an In-Plan Hospital listed in the Plan Provider Directory.) Contact your PCP to notify him or her of your visit and to arrange for any follow-up care \nIf you are admitted to a hospital on an inpatient basis directly from the emergency room, you will not have to pay the emergency room Copay. However, you will have to pay any applicable hospital admission Copay. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "# \nIf you should become Medicare-eligible within the coming year, you should read “Your Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare” in Appendix A: Group Insurance Commission Notices. It provides information about your GIC sponsored drug coverage and the Medicare drug coverage to help you decide whether to enroll in one of the Medicare drug plans. \nPrescription drugs are substances that you can obtain only with the prescription of an HNE In-Plan Doctor. There are a few prescription drugs that HNE does not cover. There are also some drugs for which HNE provides limited, rather than full, coverage. \n# \nThere are three levels (or Tiers) of Copays for prescription drugs, depending on whether the drug is classified as a Generic, Formulary, or Non-Formulary drug. (These terms are defined below.) In addition, there are two ways to purchase prescribed drugs – either at an In-Plan pharmacy or through mail order. How you buy your prescribed drugs also affects how much you pay. Copays must be paid to the pharmacy at the time of purchase. \nSometimes, a prescription drug that is covered as part of your pharmacy benefit may be administered in your provider’s office. If a pharmacy drug is dispensed in a provider’s office, then any applicable Copay may apply. This is in addition to the office visit Copay. \nAt an In-Plan Pharmacy You Pay for up to a 30-day supply: \n $\\$10$ per prescription or refill for Generic drugs  $\\$30$ per prescription or refill for brand name Formulary drugs $\\$65$ per prescription or refill for brand name Non-Formulary drugs \nPrescription drugs filled at an In-Plan Pharmacy are limited to one 30-day supply per prescription. If the applicable Copay is more than the retail price of a drug, the Member pays the retail price. Each Copay covers up to a 30-day supply of a prescription or refill. If the prescription is for less than a 30-day supply of a medication, a full Copay applies.  Each of the Copays listed above applies to a 30-day supply or less. The quantity of drugs in a 30-day supply is based on normal dosages. See the “Prescription Drug Limitations” later in this section of the Member Handbook for further information. \nAccess 90 Program at an In-Plan Pharmacy You Pay for up to a 90-day supply: \n$\\$30$ per prescription or refill for Generic drugs  $\\$90$ per prescription or refill for brand name Formulary drugs $\\$195$ per prescription or refill for brand name Non-Formulary drugs \nThis program allows you to receive up to a 90-day supply of maintenance medications at participating retail pharmacies. A Copay will apply to each 30-day supply. The Access 90 Program does not apply to prescriptions filled at HNE's specialty pharmacy or if prohibited by law. Please note: You will be required to obtain a prescription from your physician for a 90-day supply of medication. \nThrough Mail Order You Pay for a 90-day supply: \n $\\$25$ per prescription or refill for Generic drugs  $\\$75$ per prescription or refill for brand name Formulary drugs  $\\$165$ per prescription or refill for brand name Non-Formulary drugs \nYou may obtain a 90-day supply of maintenance drugs through an HNE participating mail order supplier. Maintenance drugs include medications taken for a chronic illness. In general, a medication is classified as “maintenance” if it: (1) is used for chronic illnesses such as asthma, allergies, high blood pressure, etc.; and (2) has been obtained by prescription at least twice at a participating pharmacy. Each of the Copays listed above applies to a 90-day supply or less. The quantity of drugs in a 90-day supply is based on normal dosages.  See “Prescription Drug Limitations” later in this section of the Member Handbook for further information."

        "text": "The following items may not be purchased through the mail service: \nAny drugs for which mail service is prohibited by law   \nPrescriptions for which a 90-day supply may not be appropriate as determined by HNE   \nInjectables \nHNE has a national network of participating pharmacies. To find a nearby participating pharmacy, refer to your Plan Provider Directory, call HNE Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday-Friday, $8\\mathrm{a.m.}-6$ p.m. or visit our website. \n# \nHNE covers most prescription drugs and a small number of non-prescription drugs and medical supplies that are Medically Necessary for preventive care or treating illness, injury or pregnancy. Most generic contraceptives are covered at $\\$0$ Copay. \nGeneric and Brand/Formulary drugs comprise the HNE Formulary. If a medication is not in the HNE Formulary, it is considered Brand/Non-Formulary.  Members still have access to these medications, but at higher Copays. HNE does not waive or reduce Copays for any prescription drugs. \nIn general, new brand name drugs, or existing drugs with new treatment purposes, are not added to HNE’s Formulary right away. There is at least a six month period after they are approved by the FDA called the Clinical Review Period (CRP).This applies to all new drugs, including those dispensed at a retail pharmacy, from a specialty pharmacy, in the doctor’s office, or in an infusion suite. \nHNE does not cover drugs during the CRP. Your doctor may ask us to make an exception. If we approve coverage of the drug during the CRP, your Copay will be $\\$50$ or $50\\%$ of the cost of the drug, whichever is greater. At the end of the CRP, HNE may decide not to cover the drug and add it to the exclusion list. If this happens, HNE will not cover you for the drug after the CRP. If HNE does decide to cover the drug, your Copay will be the amount of the tier to which the drug is assigned. \nHNE also establishes exclusions and limitations on drug coverage. We rely on input from a team of doctors and pharmacists who are advised by physician consultants from numerous medical specialties. You may call HNE Member Services or visit our drug formulary look up tool at healthnewengland.org for the most up-to-date information about the Tier status of a particular drug. \nGeneric (Tier 1):  A Generic drug is a drug that is not protected by a trademark.  Generic drugs contain the same active ingredients as brand name drugs and deliver the same amount of medication to the body in the same amount of time. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews Generic drugs to assure that they are safe and effective.  Generic drugs are generally a much better value than brand name drugs, so a lower Copay applies.  Note:  Unless your doctor has written “no substitution” on your prescription, a Massachusetts pharmacy is required by state law to give you a Generic drug if one is available. \nBrand/Formulary (Tier 2):  The HNE Formulary is a list of HNE-approved brand name drugs. A committee of physicians and pharmacists considers a drug’s quality, cost, safety, and performance and places drugs on the Formulary. HNE revises the Formulary from time to time. You will pay a lower Copay for brand name drugs if they are listed in the Formulary. The Formulary is made available to all participating pharmacies.  To find out if the drug you use is in the HNE Formulary, or to request a copy of the HNE Formulary, call HNE Member Services or visit our website. Please be aware that if a generic equivalent becomes available for any brand name drug on the HNE Formulary, the brand name drug will no longer be covered unless medical necessity is established. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "Brand/Non-Formulary (Tier 3):  Non-Formulary drugs are also brand name drugs.  However, HNE has found that these drugs have no special advantage over Formulary drugs that are used to treat the same condition.  NonFormulary drugs are generally more expensive than Formulary drugs. Drugs with FDA approved generic equivalents are only covered by HNE if Medical Necessity has been established. Your physician may request prior authorization for a brand name drug by filling out a Medication Request Form and faxing it into HNE for review, along with documentation of medical necessity. Medical necessity includes, but is not limited to; inadequate response or allergic reaction to generic. If approved, the Copay for a medication under this status would be Tier 3. \n# \nHNE will provide you or your employer with 60 days prior written notice whenever a drug is moving from Formulary to Non-Formulary status. To find out if a drug you use is in the HNE Formulary, or to request a copy of the HNE Formulary, call Member Services or visit our website. \n# \nOral cancer drugs are now covered in the same way as drugs you receive by infusion. You do not pay a Copay for these drugs when obtained through HNE’s pharmacy vendor. \nYou must fill most prescriptions for oral cancer drugs through HNE’s specialty pharmacy vendor. Some drugs require Prior Approval. You can find information about the requirements for specific drugs in HNE’s Drug Formulary at healthnewengland.org. Or you can call HNE Member Services for help. \n# \nSome injectable medications may be injected by properly trained medical staff only. Some of these medications may require prior authorization. If approved; they are covered in full when provided during a Covered Service. Other injectable medications are available at retail pharmacies, and may be self-administered, that is, injected by the patient him- or herself. These medications are covered under HNE's pharmacy benefit even if injected by an In-Plan Provider. Only urgently needed injectable medical drugs may be filled at contracted retail pharmacies. These will be subject to a tiered Copay. To find out if a self- administered injectable drug is in the HNE Formulary, or to request a copy of the HNE Formulary, call Member Services or visit our website. \n# \nPrescriptions for self-administered injectables and oral oncology drugs must be filled at HNE’s specialty pharmacy vendor.

See below for information about drugs that require Prior Approval or are subject to limitations.) \nCompounded medications  Diabetic related medications and supplies (see page 28) Drugs that require a prescription All birth control drugs and devices that have been approved by the FDA Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) prescription drugs Note: Cancer and HIV/AIDS are sometimes treated with drugs used “off label.” This means that the drug has not been approved by the FDA. For these “off label” uses, HNE requires approval in advance. These uses must meet set standards.

HNE’s Quality Management Program can help you to ensure that you receive the correct medication and dose that will be effective for you. When a prescription is filled, it is electronically screened for several quality issues, including allergies, drug-drug interactions and dosage limits. \nFor example, the screening might show that you are taking more pills than you need. If you are taking two pills of one medication, such as a $10\\mathrm{mg}$ pill, then the pharmacist may be able to dispense $20~\\mathrm{mg}$ pills to you so that you can take only one $20~\\mathrm{mg}$ pill at a time. When you fill your prescription, you would be taking the same total dosage each time, but taking it in one pill instead of two. \nSometimes a pharmacist may notice that your prescription quantity for the month exceeds the monthly limit recommended by the FDA or an accepted clinical practice guideline. In this case you and your provider will be informed. This allows an opportunity for your doctor to decide if your dosage should be maintained at the current level or if you might be eligible to adjust to a dose within the FDA recommendations. \nIn all cases, your provider may submit information for medical case review to allow your prescription to be processed outside of these guidelines. You can be assured that we will work with you and your physician to be certain that you always get the correct medication in the simplest and safest form for you. \nIn addition, HNE may place limits on the quantity of a drug covered, the amount that can be obtained for each Copay, or the medical conditions for which a covered drug may be prescribed. \nHNE will provide you or your employer with 60 days prior written notice before changing coverage of any other drugs.

Procedures requiring Prior Approval are listed in this section.   \nHNE also performs retrospective and concurrent reviews as part of its Utilization Management program. \n# \nThe purpose of HNE’s Utilization Management program is to review certain claims to determine if they are Covered Services and if they are Medically Necessary and appropriate. There may be times when a service is not approved. When this occurs, coverage for the services may be denied. A utilization management denial may be made only on the basis of whether it is Medically Necessary or appropriate or if it is not a Covered Service under the Plan. HNE knows that there is a risk of under-utilization of necessary health care services. It therefore states that: \nHNE’s utilization management programs have been designed to ensure that medical decision-making is based on the appropriateness of care and services and the existence of coverage. HNE encourages all clinicians and administrative staff who are involved in utilization management review to work collaboratively to help Members obtain access to appropriate health care resources. HNE does not provide compensation or other financial incentive or reward to its In-Plan Providers or staff who conducts utilization management review that is based on the quantity or type of denial decisions rendered. \n# \nIn order to obtain coverage for certain services and procedures, your Primary Care Provider or treating In-Plan Provider is required to get HNE’s Prior Approval.

USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. The GIC has more generous guidelines for benefit coverage that apply to persons subject to USERRA, as set forth below: \nIf you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your dependents while in the military. Even if you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated to GIC health coverage when you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members who elect to continue their GIC health coverage are required to pay the employee’s share for such coverage.  USERRA coverage runs concurrently with COBRA and other state continuation Coverage. \nPlease see Appendix A for more details. \n# \nGroup Subscribers and Dependents who are no longer eligible for Group coverage, or who have exhausted their continuation coverage may be eligible to continue coverage by enrolling in individual (non-group) coverage through HNE, the Commonwealth Healthcare Connector, or Health Services Administrators. For more information, contact HNE Member Services or go online to healthnewengland.org. \n# \nIf you should terminate your GIC health plan coverage, you may need to provide evidence of your prior coverage in order to enroll in another group plan, to reduce a waiting period in another group health plan, or to get certain types of individual coverage, even if you have health problems. This notice describes certain HIPAA protections available to you under federal law when changing your health insurance coverage. If you have questions about your HIPAA rights, contact the Massachusetts Division of Insurance at (617) 521-7777 or the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration at (866) 444-3272. \nWhen you have the right to specially enroll in another plan.  If you lose your group health plan coverage, you may be able to get into another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse’s plan), even if the plan generally does not accept late enrollees. In order to do so, however, you must request enrollment within 30 days of your group coverage termination. Marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption can also trigger these special enrollment rights. Therefore, should you have such a life event or your coverage end, you should request special enrollment in another plan as soon as possible if you are eligible for it. \nYou have the right not to be discriminated against based on health status. A group health plan may not refuse to enroll you or your dependents based on anything related to your health, nor can the plan charge you or your dependents more for coverage, based on health factors, than the amount it charges similarly situated individuals for the coverage."

If this happens, HNE has the right to recover from a Member’s other insurance the value of the services that were provided or arranged by HNE’s In-Plan Providers. Also, whenever payments which should have been made by HNE in accordance with this section have been made by any other plan, HNE will have the right, at its discretion, to pay that plan any amount it determines to be warranted. The amounts paid will be considered benefits that HNE paid. HNE will be fully released from liability under this Member Handbook to the extent of such payments. \nFor the purposes of this section, HNE may give or obtain any information about a Member that it deems necessary. Any Member claiming benefits under this Member Handbook must provide HNE with the information it needs to carry out this section. \nBenefits under this Member Handbook will be coordinated to the extent permitted by law with other plans covering health benefits, including: all health benefit plans, governmental benefits (including Medicare), motor vehicle insurance, medical payment policies, and homeowner insurance. \nHNE's rights under this section will remain even after this Member Handbook ceases to be in effect, but only as to services provided while the Member Handbook was in effect. \n# \n# \nWhen anyone has coverage with HNE and another Group health plan, it is known as “double coverage.” You must tell us if you or a family member has double coverage.

It pays benefits next. This process is known as “coordination of benefits.” If we are the secondary payer, we may be entitled to receive payment from your primary plan. HNE decides which insurance is primary based on rules used throughout the insurance industry, or as required by law and applicable regulations. A copy of these rules is available upon request. \nWe will always provide you with the benefits described in this Member Handbook. However, HNE will only provide coverage under this Member Handbook to Members who have other health insurance coverage if they follow HNE policies and rules.

Medicare rules determine who has the first responsibility to pay for medical care. When HNE provides benefits to a Medicare eligible Member, HNE will coordinate coverage with Medicare according to Medicare rules. If you are an ACTIVE employee age 65 or over, present your HNE card (not your Medicare card) to ensure HNE is charged for the visit. If you are still working and are age 65 or over, HNE is your primary health insurance provider; Medicare (if you have it) is secondary. You may need to explain this to your provider if he/she asks for your Medicare card. \n# \nFor Members who are injured and therefore entitled to benefits under the medical payment benefit of any other insurance policy, such as a homeowner’s or auto insurance policy, such coverage will be primary to the coverage under this Member Handbook. When HNE provides benefits to a Member that the Member is eligible for under such other medical payment policy, HNE will coordinate coverage with the other carrier. If the other coverage entitles you to be directly reimbursed for certain medical expenses, you agree to allow the payment to be made directly to HNE. \n# \nIf HNE has information showing that services provided to a Member are covered under Workers' Compensation, employer's liability, or other program of similar purpose, or by a federal, state, or other government agency, HNE may suspend payment for such services until a determination is made whether payment will be made by such program. If HNE provides or pays for services for an illness or injury covered under Workers' Compensation, employer's liability, or other program of similar purpose, or by a federal, state, or other government agency, HNE will be entitled to recover its expenses from the provider of services or the party or parties legally obligated to pay for such services. \n# \nAs an HNE Member, you agree to give HNE a right of subrogation and a right of reimbursement. These terms are explained in this section. \nWho pays my medical bills if another party is responsible for my injuries or illness? \nSometimes, HNE pays medical bills for which another person (or his or her insurer) is legally responsible. HNE then has the right to make a claim against the third party to recover for the benefits and services provided. This is called subrogation. \nFor example, if you are in an accident and another party is liable for your injuries, HNE will file a lien to recover the amount paid or owed to the provider by HNE (which may differ from the provider’s fee-for-services charges) for any benefits provided to you under this Member Handbook. HNE has a right to recover even if you do not receive full settlement. HNE’s recovery is limited, however, to the amount you received by suit or settlement. \nHNE also has the right to sue in your name at HNE’s expense. If a suit brought by HNE results in an award greater than the provider’s charges, HNE then has the right to recover costs of the suit and attorney’s fees out of the excess. \n# \nIf you receive payment from another party for injuries caused by the acts or omissions of a third party, HNE has a right of reimbursement. The right of reimbursement arises only after you receive payment for your injuries from a third party or that party’s insurer. HNE then has the right to request reimbursement for the benefits and services provided to you. \nIf you receive payment from a third party, HNE will seek reimbursement from you for the provider’s charges for the benefits and services provided to you. HNE’s right to reimbursement applies even if you did not receive full settlement for your injuries. HNE will not ask for more than you received by suit or settlement."

        "text": "Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations.  HNE uses and discloses your PHI in a number of different ways in connection with your treatment, the payment for your health care, and our health care operations. We can also disclose your information to providers and other health plans that have a relationship with you, for their treatment, payment and some limited health care operations. The following are only a few examples of the types of uses and disclosures of your protected health information that we are permitted to make without your authorization: \nTreatment:  We may disclose your protected health information to health care providers (doctors, dentists, pharmacies, hospitals and other caregivers) who request it in connection with your treatment. We may also disclose your protected health information to health care providers (including their employees or business associates) in connection with preventive health, early detection and disease and case management programs. \nPayment:  We will use and disclose your protected health information to administer your health benefits policy or contract. For example, we may use your PHI to pay claims for medical services you have received, to determine your eligibility for benefits, or to coordinate your HNE coverage with that of other plans (if you have coverage through more than one plan). \nHealth Care Operations:  We will use and disclose your protected health information to support HNE’s general health care operations. For example, we may use your PHI to conduct  quality assessment activities develop clinical guidelines, operate preventive health, early detection and disease and case management programs, including contacting you or your doctors to provide appointment reminders or information about treatment alternatives, therapies, health care providers, settings of care or other health-related benefits and services. In addition, we may use your information to send fundraising communications to you. If we do, we will provide you with an opportunity to elect not to receive any further fundraising communications from us. HNE does not and will not use PHI that is genetic information about you for underwriting purposes. \n# \nIn addition to treatment, payment and health care operations, federal law allows or requires us to use or disclose your protected health information in the following additional situations without your authorization: \nRequired by Law:  We may use or disclose your protected health information to the extent we are required by law.  For example, the law compels us to disclose PHI when required by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate our compliance efforts. \nPublic Health Activities:  We may disclose your protected health information to an authorized public health authority for purposes of public health activities. The information may be disclosed for such reasons as controlling disease, injury or disability, or to report child abuse or neglect. We also may have to disclose your PHI to a person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or who may otherwise be at risk of contracting or spreading the disease. In addition, we may make disclosures to a person subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the purpose of activities related to the quality, safety or effectiveness of an FDA-regulated product or activity. \nAbuse or Neglect:  We may make disclosures to government authorities if we believe you have been a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. We will only make this disclosure if you agree or when we are required or authorized by law to do so. \nHealth Oversight:  We may disclose your protected health information to a government agency authorized to oversee the health care system or government programs, or its contractors (e.g., state insurance department, U.S. Department of Labor) for activities authorized by law, such as audits, examinations, investigations, inspections and licensure activity."

For example, disclosures may be made in response to a warrant or subpoena or for the purpose of identifying or locating a suspect, witness or missing persons or to provide information concerning victims of crimes. \nCoroners, Funeral Directors and Organ Donation:  We may disclose your protected health information in certain instances to coroners, funeral directors and organizations that help find organs, eyes, and tissue to be donated or transplanted. \nThreat to Health or Safety: If we believe that a serious threat exists to your health or safety, or to the health and safety of any other person or the public, we will notify those persons we believe would be able to help prevent or reduce the threat. \nMilitary Activity and National Security:  We may disclose your protected health information to Armed Forces personnel under certain circumstances and to authorized federal officials for the conduct of national security and intelligence activities. \nCorrectional Institutions:  If you are an inmate in a correctional facility, we may disclose your protected health information to the correctional facility for certain purposes, including the provision of health care to you or the health and safety of you or others. \nWorkers’ Compensation:  We may disclose your protected health information to the extent required by workers’ compensation laws. \nResearch:  We may use or disclose PHI for research provided certain requirements are met. \n# \nWe will only disclose your PHI to a family member or a close friend in the following circumstances: \nYou have authorized us to do so   \n That person has submitted proof of legal authority to act on your behalf That person is involved in your health care or payment for your health care and needs your PHI for these purposes.  If you are present or otherwise available prior to such a disclosure (whether in person or on a telephone call), we will either seek your verbal agreement to the disclosure or provide you an opportunity to object to it, or reasonably  infer from the circumstances, based on our exercise of professional judgment, that you would not object to the disclosure. We will only release the PHI that is directly relevant to their involvement. We may share your PHI with your friends or family members if professional judgment says that doing so is in your best interest. We will only do this if you are not present or you are unable to make health care decisions for yourself. For example, if you are unconscious and a friend is with you, we may share your PHI with your friend so you can receive care. We may disclose a minor child’s PHI to their parent or guardian. However, we may be required to deny a parent’s access to a minor’s PHI, for example, if the minor is an emancipated minor or can, under law, consent to their own health care treatment. If an individual is deceased, we may disclose to a family member or friend who was involved in the individual’s care or payment for care prior to the individual’s death, PHI of the individual that is relevant to such person’s involvement, unless doing so is inconsistent with any prior expressed preference of the individual that is known to us."

The written program description defines our quality management program structure, objectives, processes, and resources used to identify, review, measure, monitor, and evaluate the activities implemented by HNE to meet the goals of the program. \nHNE also develops a Quality Management Work Plan annually. This is the listing of activities that are implemented to meet our program goals. Projects focusing on patient safety, behavioral health issues, utilization of services, Member and provider communications, confidentiality, disease management, prevention, and continuity of care for Members have been implemented. The time frame for completion of each project is very different. Some are very simple, can be completed in a matter of months, while others are ongoing, and will be followed by HNE throughout the year. \nThe Plan’s Board of Directors has made the Quality Management Committee responsible for the performance of the Plan.  The HNE Quality Management Committee meets about three times a year to review and monitor the progress of the activities listed in the Work Plan. Participation by individual HNE network providers is also essential to the functioning of the Quality Management Program. \nIf you would like any information regarding the HNE Quality Management Program Description or Work Plan, please contact the Director of Quality Operations at (413) 233-3435. HNE will provide this information on request. \n# \nHNE has a written program for how health care service and delivery are reviewed. The program is made up of activities in the areas of utilization, case, and disease management. Its purpose is to help Members to receive the appropriate care. HNE may conduct reviews before or during the delivery of services. HNE uses nationally recognized guidelines and resources for these reviews. HNE also uses criteria that it develops with the input of local practicing physicians. Physicians outside the HNE staff may be consulted to help make a decision of medical appropriateness. Non-physicians can make a decision to approve care or services. Only HNE Medical Directors can make a decision to deny coverage for reasons of medical necessity. At times, HNE may delegate certain utilization management functions to other entities. When this occurs, HNE requires the entity to use program procedures and criteria approved by HNE. HNE annually reviews its utilization review program. \n# \nHNE has several programs to address this area. In general, the decision process is as follows: \nHNE uses Hayes, Inc. to research new and emerging medical technologies. Hayes also researches new uses of existing technologies. The research is structured and evidence-based. Analyses of market, regulatory, legal, ethical, and actuarial issues are part of the study. Hayes then makes coverage recommendations to HNE. To evaluate drugs, HNE uses a pharmacy benefit manager. HNE’s pharmacy benefit manager uses a committee of physicians and pharmacists to review new FDA-approved drugs that have been available in the United States for at least six months. Some of the criteria used to evaluate drugs are:   \n Safety   \nThe potential effects of treatment under optimal circumstances   \n The actual effects of treatment under real life conditions \nMember Handbook HNE/GICactive-16 \nGroup Insurance Commission Employees Effective Date:  July 1, 2016 \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

The Deductible is applied on a Policy Year basis. For individual plans, payments made by the Subscriber apply to this amount.

        "text": "# \nThis notice explains your COBRA rights and what you need to do to protect your right to receive it. You will receive a COBRA notice and application if the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) is informed that your current GIC coverage is ending due either to (1) end of employment, (2) reduction in hours of employment; (3) death of employee/retiree; (4) divorce or legal separation; or (5) loss of dependent child status.  This COBRA notice contains important information about your right to temporarily continue your health care coverage in the Group Insurance Commission’s (GIC’s) health plan through a federal law known as COBRA.  If you elect to continue your coverage, COBRA coverage will begin on the first day of the month immediately after your current GIC coverage ends. \nYou must complete the GIC COBRA Election Form and return it to the GIC by no later than 60 days after your group coverage ends by sending it by mail to the Public Information Unit at the GIC at P.O. Box 8747, Boston, MA 02114 or by hand delivery to the GIC, 19 Staniford Street, $4^{\\mathrm{th}}$ floor,  Boston, MA 02114.  If you do not submit a completed election form by this deadline, you will lose your right to elect COBRA coverage. \nWHAT IS COBRA COVERAGE?  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) is a federal law under which certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses and dependent children have the right to temporarily continue their existing group health coverage at group rates when group coverage otherwise would end due to certain life events, called ‘Qualifying Events.’ If you elect COBRA coverage, you are entitled to the same coverage being provided under the GIC’s plan to similarly situated employees or dependents. The GIC administers COBRA coverage. \nWHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR COBRA COVERAGE?  Each individual entitled to COBRA (known as a “Qualified Beneficiary”) has an independent right to elect the coverage, regardless of whether or not other eligible family members elect it.  Qualified Beneficiaries may elect to continue their group coverage that otherwise would end due to the following life events: \nIf you are an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or municipality covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage if \n You lose your group health coverage because your hours of employment are reduced; or  Your employment ends for reasons other than gross misconduct. \nIf you are the spouse of an employee covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage for yourself if you lose GIC health coverage for any of the following reasons (known as “qualifying events”): \nYour spouse dies;   \nYour spouse’s employment with the Commonwealth or participating municipality ends for any reason other than gross misconduct or his/her hours of employment are reduced; or   \nYou and your spouse legally separate or divorce. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "If you have dependent children who are covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, each child has the right to elect COBRA coverage if he or she loses GIC health coverage for any of the following reasons (known as “qualifying events”): \nThe employee-parent dies;   \nThe employee-parent’s employment is terminated (for reasons other than gross misconduct) or the parent’s hours or employment are reduced;   \nThe parents legally separate or divorce; or   \nThe dependent ceases to be a dependent child under GIC eligibility rules \nHOW LONG DOES COBRA COVERAGE LAST?  By law, COBRA coverage must begin on the day immediately after your group health coverage otherwise would end.  If your group coverage ends due to employment termination or reduction in employment hours, COBRA coverage may last for up to 18 months.  If it ends due to any other qualifying events listed above, you may maintain COBRA coverage for up to 36 months. \nIf you have COBRA coverage due to employment termination or reduction in hours, your family members’ COBRA coverage may be extended beyond the initial 18-month period up to a total of 36 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if a second qualifying event – the insured’s death or divorce  - occurs during the 18 months of COBRA coverage.  You must notify the GIC in writing within 60 days of the second qualifying event and before the 18-month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage.   Your COBRA coverage may be extended to a total of 29 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if any qualified beneficiary in your family receiving COBRA coverage is disabled during the first 60 days of your 18-month COBRA coverage. You must provide the GIC with a copy of the Social Security Administration’s disability determination within 60 days after you receive it and before your initial 18 month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage. \nCOBRA coverage will end before the maximum coverage period ends if any of the following occurs: \n The COBRA cost is not paid in full when due (see section on paying for COBRA); You or another qualified beneficiary become covered under another group health plan that does not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion for the qualified beneficiary’s pre-existing covered condition covered by COBRA benefits; You are no longer disabled as determined by the Social Security Administration (if your COBRA coverage was extended to 29 months due to disability); The Commonwealth of Massachusetts or your municipal employer no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees; or Any reason for which the GIC terminates a non-COBRA enrollee’s coverage (such as fraud). \nThe GIC will notify you in writing if your COBRA coverage is to be terminated before the maximum coverage period ends.  The GIC reserves the right to terminate your COBRA coverage retroactively if you are subsequently found to have been ineligible for coverage. \nHOW AND WHEN DO I ELECT COBRA COVERAGE?  Qualified beneficiaries must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of the date that their group coverage otherwise would end or within 60 days of receiving a COBRA notice, whichever is later.  A qualified beneficiary may change a prior rejection of COBRA election any time until that date.  If you do not elect COBRA coverage within the 60–day election period, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage."

        "text": "In considering whether to elect COBRA coverage you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law, including the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a spouse’s plan) within 30 days after your GIC coverage ends due to a qualifying event. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of COBRA coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum time available to you. \nHOW MUCH DOES COBRA COVERAGE COST?  Under COBRA, you must pay $102\\%$ of the applicable cost of your COBRA coverage.  If your COBRA coverage is extended to 29 months due to disability, your cost will increase to $150\\%$ of the applicable full cost rate for the additional 11 months of coverage.  COBRA costs will change periodically; current COBRA rates are included with this notice. \nHOW AND WHEN DO I PAY FOR COBRA COVERAGE?  If you elect COBRA coverage, you must make your first payment for COBRA coverage within 45 days after the date you elect it.  If you do not make your first payment for COBRA coverage within the 45-day period, you will lose all COBRA coverage rights under the plan. \nYour first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time your coverage would have ended up to the time you make the first payment.  Services cannot be covered until the GIC receives and processes this first payment, and you are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is enough to cover this entire period.  After you make your first payment, you will be required to pay for COBRA coverage for each subsequent month of coverage.  These periodic payments are due usually around the $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of each month.  The GIC will send monthly bills, specifying the due date for payment and the address to which payment is to be sent for COBRA coverage, but you are responsible for paying for the coverage even if you do not receive a monthly statement.  Payments should be sent to the GIC’s address on the bill. \nAfter the first payment, you will have a 30-day grace period beyond the due date on each monthly bill in which to make your monthly payment.  Your COBRA coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment.  If you fail to make a periodic payment before the end of the grace period for that payment, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage. \nCAN I ELECT OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE BESIDES COBRA?  Yes.  You have the right to enroll, within 31 days after coverage ends, in an individual health insurance ‘conversion’ policy with your current health plan without providing proof of insurability. Alternately, if you are a Massachusetts resident, you may purchase health insurance through the Commonwealth’s Health Connector Authority, or for employees in other states, through a Health Insurance Marketplace where available. The GIC has no involvement in conversion programs, and only very limited involvement in Health Connector programs.  You pay the premium to the plan sponsor for the coverage. The benefits provided under such a policy might not be identical to those provided through COBRA.  You may exercise this right in lieu of electing COBRA coverage, or you may exercise this right after you have received the maximum COBRA coverage available to you. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

        "text": "# \nYOU ARE RECEIVING THIS NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY THE NEW NATIONAL HEALTH REFORM LAW (ALSO KNOWN AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ACA) \nOn January 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented in Massachusetts and across the nation. The ACA brought many benefits to Massachusetts and its residents, helping us expand coverage to more Massachusetts residents, making it more affordable for small businesses to offer their employees healthcare, and providing additional tools to help families, individuals and businesses find affordable coverage. This notice is meant to help you understand health insurance Marketplaces, which are required by the ACA to make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the state Marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector.  While you may or may not qualify for health insurance through the Health Connector, it may still be helpful for you to read and understand the information included here. \nOverview: There is an easy way for many individuals and small businesses in Massachusetts to buy health insurance: the Massachusetts Health Connector. This notice provides some basic information about the Health Connector, and how coverage available through the Health Connector relates to any coverage that may be offered by your employer.  You can find out more by visiting: MAhealthconnector.org, or for non-Massachusetts residents, Healthcare.gov or (1-800-318-2596; TTY: 1-855-889-4325). \nWhat is the Massachusetts Health Connector? The Health Connector is our state’s health insurance Marketplace. It is designed to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health insurance that meets their needs and fits their budget. The Health Connector offers \"one-stop shopping\" to easily find and compare private health insurance options from the state’s leading health and dental insurance companies. Some individuals and families may also qualify for a new kind of tax credit that lowers their monthly premium right away, as well as Cost Sharing reductions that can lower out-of-pocket expenses.  This new tax credit is enabled by $\\S26\\mathrm{B}$ of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code. \nOpen enrollment for individuals and families to buy health insurance coverage through the Health Connector occurs every year.

        "text": "If you purchase a health plan through the Health Connector instead of accepting health coverage offered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts please note that you will lose the employer contribution (if any) for your health insurance. Also, please note that the amount that you and your employer contribute to your employer-sponsored health insurance is often excluded from federal and state income taxes.  Health Connector premiums have different tax treatment. \nAs part of considering whether the ACA and Marketplaces will affect you as an employee it is important to understand what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts offers you. \nThe Commonwealth offers benefited employees health coverage through the Group Insurance Commission. To be eligible for GIC health insurance, a state employee must work a minimum of $18~\\%$ hours in a 37.5 hour workweek or 20 hours in a 40 hour workweek. The employee must contribute to a participating GIC retirement system, such as the State Board of Retirement, a municipal retirement board, the Teachers Retirement Board, the Optional Retirement Pension System for Higher Education, a Housing, Redevelopment Retirement Plan, or another Massachusetts public sector retirement system (OBRA is not such a public retirement system for this purpose.  Visit www.mass.gov/gic or see your GIC Coordinator for more information. Temporary employees, contractors, less-than-half time part time workers, and most seasonal employees are not eligible for GIC health insurance benefits. These employees may shop for health insurance through the Health Connector and may be eligible for advanced premium federal tax credits and/or state subsidies if their gross family income is at or below $400\\%$ Federal Poverty Level (which is approximately $\\$46,000$ for an individual and $\\$94,000$ for a family of four).  Visit www.MAhealthconnector.org or call 1-877-MAENROLL for more information. \nIf there is any confusion around your employment status and what you are eligible for, please email healthmarketplacenotice@massmail.state.ma.us or contact your HR department or GIC Coordinator."

USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services.  The GIC has more generous guidelines for benefit coverage that apply to persons subject to USERRA, as set forth below: \nIf you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your dependents while in the military. \nService members who elect to continue their GIC health coverage are required to pay the employee’sمshareمforمsuchمcoverage. \nEven if you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated to GIC health coverage when you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. \nThe U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations. \nFor assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 1-866-4- USA-DOL or visit its website at http://www.dol.gov/vets. An interactive online USERRA Advisor can be viewed at http://www.dol.gov/elaws/userra.htm.  If you file a complaint with VETS and VETS is unable to resolve it, you may request that your case be referred to the Department of Justice or the Office of Special Counsel, as applicable, for representation.  You may also bypass the VETS process and bring a civil action against an employer for violations of USERRA.  The rights listed here may vary depending on the circumstances. \nFor more information about your GIC coverage, please contact the Group Insurance Commission at (617) 727-2310, ext. 1."

This notice has information about your currentمprescriptionمdrugمcoverageمwithمtheمPlanمandمyourمoptionsمunderمMedicare’sمprescriptionمdrug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining a non-GIC plan, you should compare your current coverage – particularly which drugs are covered, and at what cost – with that of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage can be found at the end of this notice. \n# \n# \n1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available to everyone with Medicare in 2006. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium.   \n2. The GIC has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by your plan is, on average for all participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare Part D drug plan. \n# \nYou can join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each subsequent year from October $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ to December $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ . \nHowever, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan. \n# \nIf you enroll in another Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with or without prescription drug coverage, you will be disenrolled from the GIC-sponsored HNE plan. If you are disenrolled from HNE, you will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.   \nIf you are the insured and decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan, both you and your covered spouse/dependents will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY/TDD: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."

It tells your health care provider what to do if you can’t make decisions about your care. There are different kinds of Advance Directives. \n# \n# \nA healthcare proxy is a written document. It allows you to assign a healthcare agent (agent). Your agent can make healthcare decisions for you if you can’t make them yourself. You can assign a family member, friend, attorney, or other person of your choice. It is also a good idea to identify a back-up agent, in case the original agent is unavailable. \nYour agent should make decisions based on what he or she thinks you would want. If this is unknown, he or she should decide based on your medical best interest. Your agent may make healthcare decisions in any situation where you can’t make decisions. It is not just for end of life situations. You also can limit the agent's decision-making power. \nChoosing an agent is an important decision. Before signing a healthcare proxy, talk to your agent. Make sure he or she is willing to take on this role. Select someone who knows you and will honor your wishes. Discuss your wishes openly and in detail. That way, your agent can represent you well. It is important for your agent to know what you would want. \nIn Massachusetts, two witnesses must sign the healthcare proxy document for it to be legal. Your agent cannot be an “operator, administrator, or employee of a hospital, nursing home, rest home, etc. … where the principal is presently a patient.\" \n# \nA living will is a written statement. It explains your wishes for medical treatment and end of life care if you can’t communicate them directly. It may tell physicians when you wish treatment to be withheld or withdrawn. This includes situations when you do not want drastic life-saving steps taken. \nThere is no Massachusetts law specifically for living wills. However, if you have appointed a healthcare proxy, living will instructions are recognized as evidence of your wishes. \nFor more information about Advance Directives, you can contact: The Massachusetts Commission on End of Life Care 250 Washington St, 4th Floor Boston, MA 02108 Phone: (617) 636-3480 Fax: (617) 636-4017 www.endoflifecommission.org \nThere is no specific healthcare proxy form required in Massachusetts. However, easy-to-use sample forms that comply with Massachusetts law are available at the Massachusetts Medical Society website (www.mms.org), the Hospice and Palliative Care Federation of MA website (www.hospicefed.org/hospice_pages/proxy.htm), and the Central Massachusetts Partnership to Improve Care at the End of Life website (www.betterending.org). \nIf you have any questions or need help getting a health care proxy form, please call HNE Member Services or your attorney. \nIf you have questions, please call Health New England Member Services at (413) 787-4004 or (800) 310-2835 (TTY: (800) 439-2370), Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. or visit healthnewengland.org."
