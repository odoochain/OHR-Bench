Bureau: \n9/10/2007   \nDepartment of State   \nInformation Resource Management   \nExhibit 300 - Global Network   \n014-00-02-00-01-1100-00 \n4. Name of this Capital Asset: \n5. Unique Project (Investment) Identifier: (For IT investment only, see section 53. For all other, use agency ID system.) \n6. What kind of investment will this be in FY2009?  (Please Mixed Life Cycle   \nNOTE: Investments moving to O&M in FY2009, with   \nPlanning/Acquisition activities prior to FY2009 should not   \nselect O&M. These investments should indicate their current   \nstatus.) \n8. Provide a brief summary and justification for this investment, including a brief description of how this closes in part or in whole an identified agency performance gap: \nThe Global Network Program operates & modernizes the State Department's global network. This network forms the backbone of the Department's IT infrastructure, providing essential communication to 260 diplomatic posts around the world, including embassies, consulates, and multi-agency missions. It also connects 240 additional sites, such as post annexes. Employees increasingly rely on the network's communications to further the United States' foreign policy goals. Global Network supports the strategic goal: strengthening consular & management capabilities. \nThe Department envisions an IT environment that allows access to IT resources \"via an integrated continually refreshed infrastructure that extends to mobile end-user devices..\"(State & USAID Joint Strategic Plan FY07-12). To support this vision, the Global Network is taking bold steps to provide a network that is secure, always available, and has sufficient bandwidth to support a multitude of services. This effort also helps prepare the Department for the IT Infrastructure Line of Business Initiative. \nThe Global Network is a consolidated business case, integrating subprograms: \n1. Enterprise Network Management modernizes & maintains communications over the global network, providing essential connectivity to Foreign Affairs personnel around the world. \n2. Bandwidth Management analyzes network capacity requirements, helps posts procure network connectivity, & provides funding for global bandwidth. Use of innovative technologies has helped the program increase bandwidth capacity while reducing the cost per bit of bandwidth. \n3. Enterprise Software Licensing establishes & maintains enterprise software licensing agreements, lowering the prices the Department pays per license based on volume purchases. \n4. The Alternate Communications Site (ACS), housed at a FEMA location, is an alternate site for routing essential communications in the event the primary locations are not operational. \n5. The InfoCenter is a 24-hour IT help desk providing first-tier customer support for embassies, consulates, & offices throughout the world. \n9. Did the Agency's Executive/Investment Committee Yes   \napprove this request? a. If \"yes,\" what was the date of this approval? 8/28/2007   \n10. Did the Project Manager review this Exhibit? Yes   \n12. Has the agency developed and/or promoted cost Yes   \neffective, energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable   \ntechniques or practices for this project? a. Will this investment include electronic assets Yes   \n(including computers)? b. Is this investment for new construction or major No   \nretrofit of a Federal building or facility?

Are the records produced by this investment Yes appropriately scheduled with the National Archives and Records Administration's approval? \nQuestion 24 must be answered by all Investments: \n# \nIn order to successfully address this area of the exhibit 300, performance goals must be provided for the agency and be linked to the annual performance plan. The investment must discuss the agency's mission and strategic goals, and performance measures (indicators) must be provided. These goals need to map to the gap in the agency's strategic goals and objectives this investment is designed to fill. They are the internal and external performance benefits this investment is expected to deliver to the agency (e.g., improve efficiency by 60 percent, increase citizen participation by 300 percent a year to achieve an overall citizen participation rate of 75 percent by FY 2xxx, etc.). The goals must be clearly measurable investment outcomes, and if applicable, investment outputs. They do not include the completion date of the module, milestones, or investment, or general goals, such as, significant, better, improved that do not have a quantitative or qualitative measure. \nAgencies must use the following table to report performance goals and measures for the major investment and use the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Performance Reference Model (PRM). Map all Measurement Indicators to the corresponding \"Measurement Area\" and \"Measurement Grouping\" identified in the PRM. There should be at least one Measurement Indicator for each of the four different Measurement Areas (for each fiscal year). The PRM is available at www.egov.gov.

Risk analysis includes classifying the risks and assessing the risk probability, impact, immediacy, and controllability.  These attributes help the Global Network program manager identify the greatest risks to the program and ensure they are appropriately mitigated. \nTo facilitate risk analysis, all Global Network project managers (PMs) attended a risk assessment workshop.  Using a risk assessment tool developed in concert with the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), the PMs answered a series of questions to more objectively quantify risk probability and impact, particularly related the project cost and schedule performance. \nAll projects within the Global Network follow the Managing State Projects (MSP) lifecycle and report on their risks at each control gate, in addition to semiannual project status reviews.  Cost and schedule performance is tracked within the Earned Value Management System (EVMS), which has helped PMs understand how realized risks have affected the project - leading to better future estimates."
