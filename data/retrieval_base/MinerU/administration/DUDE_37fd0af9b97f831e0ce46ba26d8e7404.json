CoCs are required to provide an unduplicated count of homeless persons according to HUD standards (explained in HUD’s two guides to Counting Sheltered and Unsheltered Homeless People at https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/counting_unsheltered.pdf). HUD has conducted a limited data quality review but has not independently verified all of the information submitted by each CoC. The reader is therefore cautioned that since compliance with these standards may vary, the reliability and consistency of the homeless counts may also vary among CoCs. Additionally, a shift in the methodology a CoC uses to count the homeless may cause a change in homeless counts between reporting periods. \n# \nSummary by household type reported: \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllll}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Sheltered} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Unsheltered} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Total} \\\\\n & Emergency Shelter & Transitional Housing* \\\\\nHouseholds without children1 & 523 & 289 & 794 & 1,606 \\\\\nHouseholds with at least one adult and one child2 & 19 & 72 & 0 & 91 \\\\\nHouseholds with only children3 & 13 & 37 & 4 & 54 \\\\\nTotal Homeless Households & 555 & 398 & 798 & 1,751 \\\\\nPersons inhouseholdswithout childrenl & 523 & 304 & 810 \\\\\nPersons Age 18 to 24 & 86 & 44 & 124 & 1,637 254 \\\\\nPersons Over Age 24 & 437 & 260 & 686 & 1,383 \\\\\nPersons inhouseholds with at least one adult and one child2 & 57 & 229 & 0 & 286 \\\\\nChildren Under Age 18 & 36 & 126 & 0 & 162 \\\\\nPersons Age 18 to 24 & 6 & 30 & 0 & 36 \\\\\nPersons Over Age 24 & 15 & 73 & 0 & 88 \\\\\nPersons in households with only children3 & 13 & 37 & 8 & 58 \\\\\nTotal Homeless Persons & 593 & 570 & 818 & 1,981 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{mmary of homeless persons by subpopulations reported:} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Chronically Homeless} & Sheltered 77 & Unsheltered 395 & Total Population 472 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Chronically Homeless Individuals} & 70 & 395 & 465 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Chronically Homeless Persons in Families} & 7 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Severely Mentally Il} & 193 & 379 & 572 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Chronic Substance Abuse} & 249 & 465 & 714 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Veterans} & 126 & 67 & 193 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{HIV/AIDS} & 49 & 19 & 68 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{Victims of DomesticViolence} & 120 & 89 & 209 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\nTuesday, October 07, 2014 ,\\* Safe Haven programs are included in the Transitional Housing category. ¹This category includes single adults, adult couples with no children, and groups of adults. ²This category includes households with one adult and at least one child under age 18. ³This category includes persons under age 18, including children in one-child households, adolescent parents and their children, adolescent siblings, or other household configurations composed only of children."
