C. \nfugust $\\dot{\\mathfrak{g}}$ . 1944 \nSOME OBSERVATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS REGARDING NUTRITION CLINIC DEMONSTRATIONS \nNutrition clinic demonstrations are infornal neetings. The physician conducting the \"clinic\" points out and discusses signs and symptons of malnutrition exhibited by individuals having various nutritional deficiencies and who have agreed to participate in the denonstration. This serves to show some of the things that malnutrition does to people.: Each clinic is sponsored by a health departnent, medical school, or other local nedical organization at ·the request of the state or local nutrition committee,which acts as co-sponsor. \nThis surmary has been prepared as a result of requests for information and suggestions concerning such demonstrations. \nPurposes for Which Nutrition Clinic Demonstrations are Conduoted: \nl. To give professional people and other workers in the National Nutrition Progran a nore adequate concept of good and poor nutrition.   \n2. To stress the fact that nost of the malnutrition in this country is found in mild or noderately severe forns rather than as 'severe classical deficiency states.   \n3. To enphasize the fact that nalnutrition is \"a group of diseases to which nany factors contribute. and that understanding of the. problen depends upon an appreciation of its various aspects.   \n4. To point out that because signs and syuptons of nalnutrition may be caused by organic. or functional disturbances or disease conditions, malnutrition in_the_individual should be recognized as a nedical problen which shauia be diagnosed and treated by_a physician.   \n5. To enpnasize that the nutritional problens of_the_comnunity depend for their. solution on appreciation of the various aspects. of these problems by all individuals and agencies working in the field of nutrition and upon their coorainated efforts to_work qut solutions.   \n6. To stress the fact.that malnutrition can be prevented by the establishment and maintenance of good.habits, together with wise production and utilization of food. \nRequests for Assistance \nThe Nutrition Programs Branch, Office of Distribution, War Food Administration, assists'State and local health departments and nutrition committees in planning and conducting these demonstrations by making available to them the services of"

He assists the local health officers in selecting patients and conducts, or assists in conducting, the clinics. \nSince Dr. Wilkins is a medical officer detailed from the U. S. Public Health Service to the Office of Distribution, formal requests for his participation in clinic demonstrations are made by the State health officer to the Surgeon General, U. S. Public Health Service, Bethesda, Md.; or to the appropriate U. S. Public -.: Health Service District Medical Office. In making such requests, health officers have stated that the work to be done is in cooperation with the nutrition committee \nPreparation for Nutrition Clinic Demonstrations \nThe greater part of the work connected with the clinics must be done in advance of the actual demonstrations. In some instances, a clinic demonstration has been held in a central place in the State. Representatives of local nutrition committees and other organized groups from various parts of the State have attended these demonstrations. In states where several clinics have been held, the State : has been divided into sections and clinics planned so that representative groups from the surrounding areas could attend with a minimum of travel. When from three to six clinics have been held in various parts of the State, they have been attende ed by representatives from all parts of the State. Of course, the number of clinics held in any State depends upon the size of the State, its population, and the transportation facilities available, as well as the time that can be devoted to this work. The number of people attending any one clinic is limited to l00 to i50 in order that everyone wiil be able to see and hear and that the meeting may be kept informal and effective. In most cases, tickets are provided by the nutrition committee. This comnittee and the health department distribute the tickets to people who ·represent agencies and groups working on'various aspect of·the nutrition problem. Each county or city in the area served by a clinic is usually represented by people from several official and voluntary ggencies. \nIn places where there is no local public health organization, plans'for organizing;, and conducting nutrition clinic demonstrations can sometimes be worked out with other local medical organizations or groups, such as medical societies, medical schools, and ho spital clinics. \nSelection of_\"Cases\" \n1.: The health department or medical group 'sponsoring the'clinic selects prospective \"cases for demonstration. Several weeks are usually allowed for case finding by health<officers and public health nurses. Work-up of cases for clinic demonstrations includes collection of diet records from prospective \"patients.\" If possible, reoord. for a full week are obtained.   \n3: Arrangements are made for getting patients to the clinic. The patients who come alone are given written instructiom's as to the. time and place that the clinic is to be held. When a child is to be presented, an adult responsible for the care of the child, preferably,one or both parents, is present."

Each patient should have complete understanding of the purpose of the meeting he is to attend and.the part he is to play in 'it. 5。 The local health departments line up 40 to 50 malnourished individuals (adults and children) for.each_clinic.. Several days before the clinic, the U. S. Public Health Service medical officer assists the local healtn officer in selecting. 15. or.20 of them to participate in each demonstration. (When health departments have been asked to 'select prospective patients for clinic demonstrations, they' have often felt that they must find clear-cut, classic deficiency cases. These are not usually very numerous in any area. However, there are many cases of malnutrition in any fairly large community or area. From these the U. S. Public Health Service medical officer, oran officer from the State health department, can assist local health.officers in 'selecting individuals who exhibit signs and synptoms of dietary deficiencies that are not. so commonly recognized.) \nAt clinics which have been held in various parts of the country, patients. have been shown who exhibited such signs as the following: \nEvidence of anemia (hypochromic)   \n2 Swollen, spongy, bleeding gums   \n3. Evidence of rickets (active or healed)   \n4. Rough skin (goose-pimplelike lesions which are aften associated'with   \nvitamin A deficiency)   \n5. Cheiiosis(often associated with riboflavin deficiency)   \n6. Slick tongue   \n7. Magenta tongue   \n8. Cracked lips   \n9. Dental caries   \n10. Goiter (simple)   \n1l. Photophobia   \n12.. Crusty eyelids   \n13. Nutritional edema \nIn addition to the above, inssome clinics infants with scurvy and patients with pellagra have been shown. Their cases have. been discussed and peliagra patients have been questioned about their previous and present diets. Mothers of infants with scurvy have been sinilarly questioned about the diets given to their babies."

        "text": "Procedures Which Have Been Used in Presenting Nutrition Clinic Demonstrations \n\nTime required: About 2 to 3 hours.   \nThe foilowing procedures are among. those which have proved successful in   \nnting nutrition clinic demonstrations. '. The local nutrition committee chairman, or a person designated by the chairman, presides at the meeting. This presiding person gives a brief statement of the objectives of the meeting.   \n2. Because the success of the meeting depends to a great extent upon the interest and cooperation of the \"patients,\" meetings start on time and discussions are shott. All matters pertaining to nutrition committee business are postponed until the demonstrations are finished, and the patients have been informed that they are free to leave if they wish.   \n3. All discussion is in language which laymen, especially the patients. can, understand. Preliminary remarks are short and to the point.   \n4. The physician who conducts the clinic gives a brief discussion. He outlines the important points relative to the purpose of the demonstra tion and the need for it.   \n5. A representative of the State health department discusses the importance of nutrition in relation to particular problems of the State or the local community.   \n6. A representative of a State agricultural agency point,s out the relationship between soils, food production, and human nutrition. Illustration by.the use of slides and charts often proves very effective. A school official or teacher discusses nutrition as it affects school children.   \n8. Presentation of patients a. Even though the clinic is held primarily for the benefit of the' nutrition committee and guests, adult patients and older children are seated as a part of the audience.. It is felt that they derive benefit. from the whole discussion. Also they are at ease when they actually participate in the' meeting. At no time are they made to feel that they are \"on exhibition.\" (A room should be provided where a nurss, or some other responsible adult, can keep young children who are to be shown in the clinic as well as small chiidren who accompany their parents to the meeting. The nurse or nutritionist who assists the doctor in conducting the clinic can bring each child or group of children into the clinic at the proper time. A few toys or picture books in the children's \"waiting room\" are valuable additions.)"

        "text": "b。 Care and consideration are' always used in presenting a patient in order to ayoid embarrassing him. The patlent is sometimes presented as a case. When the history, principally dietary, is given by the doctor the patient takes no part in the discussion; or sometimes the patient participates in the discussion by answering questions or by telling his own history. The audience is encouraged to present questions at any time during the demonstration. This helps to foster a spirit of informality. It also helps to keep the discussion centered on local problems and to'provide information needed by workers who are participating in the local nutrition program. e . In:discussing each case, the shortcomings of the diet are emphasized and specific recommendations for improvement are offered to the patient. These recomnendations are suggestions for dietary changes, or-additions to the diet: It is always suggested that the patient consult his own physician if-he has one. When it seems advisable, it is suggested that y :'. patients who have no family physician go to a clinic for guidance. g. Follow-up procedures, which may be carried out by local public heaath workers, are planned. A brief outline of the follow-up plan is valuable to the audience and helps to impress the patient with the importance of putting the recommendations to work. h. Slides are shown depicting more severe deficiency diseases in the area and are discussed by the physician who presents the clinic. A few slides showing normal development of children are used to emphasize .the importance of good nutrition. Planning for Future Work \n\nFollowing some nutrition clinic demonstrations, the sponsoring groups have made arrangements for representatives attending the meeting to eat at a nearby cafeteria or restaurant' or for a meal to be served them by some local women's group·"

Examples of types of meetings and subjects that have been discussed are listed below. \nQuestions from the audience have been directed to a panel of experts representing the State and local agencies. Various aspects of local nutrition problems were discussed and plans were made for future work. In such discussions the agencies showed how they could participate in efforts to overcome the problems by including specific activities in their regular programs.

When this is done, it is necessary to have a room which can be \"blacked out\" so that the colored slides will show iup effectively.   \nb. Suitable electric outlets or extension cords are necessary. \n2. Movable chairs which can be arranged in concentric circles. This encourages informality and makes it possible for everyone to see and hear. It also encourages participation by the entire group."
