        "text": "# \n# \n# \nclassificd as “wetlands\"-an alarming trend that many believe is threatening their propcrty rights. \nOne such “wetland\" is located on property owned by Ered Cline in California's Sonoma Valley. It was goingto he. his \"dream property\" and home to a vineyard. \nBut the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in and determined that a portion of Cline's property was federally protected wetlands. Cline was shocked.“In the summertime it is completcly dry and it's some of the best farm ground around.\" \nIn the past four years,Clinc says the government has gone to great lengths to take his Jand without compensating him. \"Why didn't they come to us and say, ‘This is very valuable as awetland for our country,so our country is going lo pay you for this'?\"asks Cline. \nThe case was eventually turmed over to the U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. \nAccording to Cline's wife,Nancy,in January 1994 the FBI conducted an invcstigation that consisted of \"interviewing neighbors, strangers [and] acquaintances, asking questions about how we treat our family. Iaskingl. Does Fred have a temper?Arewe intclligent?What [is] our religion? What [arel our praying habits?...It was unbclievable to us. We were terrified.\" The criminal case against the Clines was eventually dropped,but not before they had spent \\$100.000 in legal fees defending their property. \nMcmbers of Congress recently heard anothcr property--. rights horror story fromLouisiana developerAnthony Palermo.Palermowantsto buildacardealership on commercial property he owns,but the land was declared a wetland by the feds.During theirinvestigation,theArmy Corps of Engineers askedPalermo todetail theneedforanother car dealership in the area—including documentation listing the dealerships already there and thenumber of people served. \nThis action prompted Rep. Jiwmy Hayes (D-LA) to cal the Army Corps a \"federal agency [that'sl zoning Amcrica\" \n\nIn March, members of the House of Representatives approved legislation protecting the rights of property owncrs. Known as HR 925, the legislation requires the federal gov. emment to compensate landowncrs if their property is devalued by 20 percent or more becausc of government action. The U.S, Senate is now cousidering similar Jegislation. called the Omnibus PrivatePropertyRights Act of1995. \nThe Clinton Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers oppose this legislation. Michael Davis of the Army Corps says suchlegislationwould meanwe would eithcr quit protecting these resources that do protect peoplc's propcrty values, or wc would have to pay off a lot of money that I don't believe we as taxpayers could afford to do.\" \nBut the Chines suggcst America must place the constiuutional rights of its citizens first. \"Our Constitntion gives us private property rights,but if we don't protect then,we're going to lose them,\"said Frcd Cline. \n# \n\"[The ‘takings’ clause] is the part of the Constitution [that holds| back the monster (hat is rolling from Washington. And this wetlands [situation| has, in my opinion, gotten completcly out of hand...Wetlands [are] a good thing--to preserve the wetlands along the various estuaries and the rivers...But we're not talking about this in this case. \n# \n\"No person shall..be deprived of life, lberty, or property, without due process of law: nor shall private property be. taken for public use without just compensation.
