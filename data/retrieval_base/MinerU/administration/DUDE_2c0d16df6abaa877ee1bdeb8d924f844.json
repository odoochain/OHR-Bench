        "text": "# \n# \nPresident Trump acted to defend our Nation's historical monuments, statues, and memorials by signing an EO on June 26, 2020 that ensures that any person or group that destroys or vandalizes a monument, memorial, or statue, or those who incite violence and illegal activity, arefullyprosecuted to the extent of thelaw. \nThe EO, “Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Activity.\" directs DHS to provide personnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property. \nIn recent weeks rioters have defaced and torn down monuments and statues honoring some of the most important figures in our Nation’s storied history. These monuments memorialize the history we all share as Americans, and they deserve to be defended for future generations. Someexamples: \nIn Portland,mobs tore down statues of ourFoundingFathers--GeorgeWashington andThomasJefferson.   \nIn San Francisco, rioters tore down a statue honoring Ulysses S. Grant.   \nThere are calls to remove statues of Abraham Lincoln in Boston and Washington, DC.   \nA statue of Hans Christian Heg, who died fighting for the Union Army during the civil war,was torn down in Wisconsin. \nIn response to this EO, on July 1, DHS established the Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT) to conduct ongoing assessments of potential violence or destruction and allocateresources to protect people andproperty. \nWhile the Department respects every American's right to protest peacefully, violence and civilunrestwillnotbetolerated. \n# \n\"CBP stands ready to support our federal law enforcement partners to protect Federal facilities and property during the upcoming July $\\mathcal{I}^{t h}$ holiday weekend at locations across the country. CBP is actively identifying employees for immediate deployment to provide direct support to the Federal ProtectiveService and our interagencypartners. \n# \nO:Why are CBP officers and agents being deployed to cities across the country? \nA.CBPffcrandagents arebeng deloyed indret suport ofthPresidentialExecutiveOr and the newly established DHS Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT)"
