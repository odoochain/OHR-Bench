Conversely, nonprofit organizations that may be eligible to acquire the Subject Property for use within the scope of the Deed Restriction either cannot pay even a reasonably reduced price while at the same time assuming the costs of ownership.Because of such factors,the Subject Property has been rendered unmarketablein a reasonable fashion with the current deed restriction.Without the ability to sell the SubjectProperty at or neara fair market value,Garden Clubs will not be able to purchase a less costly newheadquarters so as to carry on its community interest purpose and the SubjectPropertywill gradually fall into disrepair and obsolescence as it will not be able to be properly maintained.   \n3.11The Deed Restriction is an unreasonable restriction on alienation.   \n3.12TheDeed Restrictionfailstobenefit any specific personorentity.   \n3.13TheDeed Restriction fails to benefit any specific piece of real property.   \n3.14 Defendants “Unknown Successors” and “Unknown Parties\"”are potential persons or entities currently unknown to Garden Clubs that may have some interest or standing as related to the property. Such “Unknown Successors”and “Unknown Parties”are named for notice purposes. Should any such person(s) and/or entity(ies) appear, such person(s) and/or entity(ies) should be added to this litigation, provided a proper basis in interest and standing be established."
