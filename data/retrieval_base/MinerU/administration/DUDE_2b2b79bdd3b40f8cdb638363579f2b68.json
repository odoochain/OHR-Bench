If at any time Lender receives, from Borrower or otherwise, any amount applicable to the Indebtedness which is less than all amounts due and payable at such time, then Lender may apply that payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender, in Lender's discretion. Neither Lender's acceptance of an amount that is less than all amounts then due and payable nor Lender's application of such payment in the manner authorized will constitute or be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding the application of any such amount to the Indebtedness, Borrower's obligations under this Instrument, the Note and all other Loan Documents will remain unchanged. \n# \n(a) If Borrower fails to perform any of its obligations under this Instrument or any other Loan Document, or if any action or proceeding is commenced which purports to affect the Mortgaged Property, Lender's security or Lender's rights under this Instrument, including eminent domain, insolvency, code enforcement, civil or criminal forfeiture, enforcement of Hazardous Materials Laws, fraudulent conveyance or reorganizations or proceedings involving a bankrupt or decedent, then Lender at Lender's option may make such appearances, file such documents, disburse such sums and take such actions as Lender reasonably deems necessary to perform such obligations of Borrower and to protect Lender's interest, including all of the following: \n(i) Lender may pay Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.   \n(ii) Lender may pay fees and out-of-pocket expenses of accountants, inspectors and consultants.   \n(ii) Lender may enter upon the Mortgaged Property to make Repairs or secure the Mortgaged Property.   \n(iv) Lender may procure the Insurance required by the Loan Agreement.   \n(v) Lender may pay any amounts which Borrower has failed to pay under the Loan Agreement.   \n(vi) Lender may perform any of Borrower's obligations under the Loan Agreement.   \n(vii) Lender may make advances to pay, satisfy or discharge any obligation of Borrower for the payment of money that is secured by a Prior Lien. \nAny amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 7, or under any other provision of this Instrument that treats such disbursement as being made under this Section 7, will be secured by this Instrument, will be added to, and become part of, the principal component of the Indebtedness, will be immediately due and payable and will bear interest from the date of disbursement until paid at the DefaultRate."

        "text": "(c) Nothing in this Section 7 will require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. \n8。 Events of Default. An Event of Default under the Loan Agreement will constitute an Event of Default under this Instrument. \n9. Remedies Cumulative. Each right and remedy provided in this Instrument is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Instrument, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or afforded by applicable law or equity, and each will be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently or successively, in any order. Lender's exercise of any particular right or remedy will not in any way prevent Lender from exercising any other right or remedy available to Lender. Lender may exercise any such remedies from time to time and as often as Lender chooses. \n10. Waiver of Statute of Limitations, Offsets, and Counterclaims. Borrower waives the right to assert any statute of limitations as a bar to the enforcement of the Lien of this Instrument or to any action brought to enforce any Loan Document. Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by Lender or otherwise to offset any obligations to make the payments required by the Loan Documents. No failure by Lender to perform any of its obligations under this Instrument will be a valid defense to, or result in any offset against, any payments that Borrower is obligated to make under any of the Loan Documents. \n# \n(a) Notwithstanding the existence of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Property held by Lender or by any other party, Lender will have the right to determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Property will be subjected to the remedies provided in this Instrument, the Note, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law. Lender will have the right to determine the order in which any or all portions of the Indebtedness are satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. \n(b) Borrower and any party who now or in the future acquires a security interest in the Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive notice of this Instrument waives any and all right to require the marshalling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in the inverse order of alienation or that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in parcels or as an entirety in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies permitted by applicable law or provided in this Instrument."

The state and federal courts and authorities with jurisdiction in the Property Jurisdiction will have jurisdiction over all controversies that may arise under or in relation to the Note, any security for the Indebtedness or any other Loan Document.
