        "text": "# \nThe Monthly Energy Review (MER) is the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) primary report of recent and historical energy statistics.  Included are statistics on total energy production, consumption, trade, and energy prices; overviews of petroleum, natural gas, coal, electricity, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and international petroleum; carbon dioxide emissions; and data unit conversions. \nRelease of the MER is in keeping with responsibilities given to EIA in Public Law 95–91 (Department of Energy Organization Act), which states, in part, in Section 205(a)(2): \n“The Administrator shall be responsible for carrying out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program which will collect, evaluate, assemble, analyze, and disseminate data and information....” \nThe MER is intended for use by Members of Congress, federal and state agencies, energy analysts, and the general public.  EIA welcomes suggestions from readers regarding the content of the MER and other EIA publications. \nRelated Monthly Publications:  Other monthly EIA reports are Petroleum Supply Monthly, Petroleum Marketing Monthly, Natural Gas Monthly, and Electric Power Monthly.  For more information, contact EIA’s Office of Communications via email at infoctr $@$ eia.gov. \n# \nData Displayed:  For tables beginning in 1949, annual data are usually displayed only in 5-year increments between 1950 and 2000 in the tables in Portable Document Format (PDF) files; however, all annual data are shown in the Excel and comma-separated values (CSV) files. Also, only two to three years of monthly data are displayed in the PDF files; however, for many series, monthly data beginning with January 1973 are available in the Excel and CSV files. \nComprehensive Changes:  Each month, most MER tables and figures carry a new month of data, which is usually preliminary (and sometimes estimated or even forecast) and likely to be revised in the succeeding month. \nAnnual Data From 1949:  In 2013, EIA expanded the MER to incorporate annual data as far back as 1949 in those data tables that were previously published in both the Annual Energy Review (AER) and MER. Analysts may wish to use the data in this report in conjunction with the AER which offers annual data beginning in 1949 for many related supplemental data series that are not found in the MER.  The AER is available at http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual. \n# \nThe MER is available on EIA’s website in a variety of formats at http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly. \n Full report and sections:  PDF files   \n Report tables:  PDF files Table data (unrounded):  Excel and CSV files Graphs:  PDF files \nNote:  PDF files display selected annual and monthly data; Excel and CSV files display all available annual and monthly data, often at a greater level of precision than the PDF files. \nTiming of Release:  The MER is posted on the EIA website no later than the last work day of the month at http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly."
