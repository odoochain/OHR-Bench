A portion of the personnel expenses will cover the Norwalk and Willard parenting class instructors for the time they spend in teaching the parenting classes to the clients. This also includes the time spent by the financial analyst doing the monthly reports and handling the finances so that the Executive Director can report to ODJFS the success of each event. \nThe staff mileage will be used by the Executive Director when she travels to attend a class about converting the center to a medical center that is offered every couple of months through NIFLA. The mileage also covers the miles used by the Client Services Director to go pick up and purchase the formula and diapers. \nThe $\\$1,000$ for office supplies will help the center with print materials so that promotional materials can be sent out to all of the clients and donors to let them know that the center has received a grant and now has new and expanded services. \nThe $\\$35,000$ was determined for the diagnostic services. The first six months will be the most expensive of the new program for transitioning to a medical center because of the purchase of the ultra sound machine and the materials such as the chair and the gel to be able to perform limitedultrasounds to clients. \nAs mentioned in the grant, Abigail Pregnancy Services will reach out to local newspapers and radio stations to promote the grant that was awarded and the new and expanded services that the center can offer. This is estimated to be $\\$2,000$ to pay for ads in the local radio stations that cover Huron County as well as the newspapers."

        "text": "It will cost $\\$4,000$ per curriculum for the parenting program. This includes the new videos, worksheets, baby models, and materials. It will be $\\$8,000$ for a new English and Spanish parenting curriculum to offer to clients. \nAs stated in the grant, clients receive a graduation gift of a brand new infant car seat once they graduate from the parenting program. This $\\$1,000$ will cover the cost of the new car seats for the graduates. \nThe $\\$2,000$ for equipment will cover the cost needed to make the room available for ultrasounds more presentable. Currently, this room is not being used and has old wallpaper that is peeling off. The floor is in bad shape as well. These funds will help this room to enhance the quality of the room the clients are in when they are receiving their limited-ultrasounds. \n$\\$1,000$ for formula will be able to provide enough formula for our clients in need. Formula is difficult because some babies need soy while others need formula for a sensitive stomach. This will ensure that we have the types of the formula that the clients need for their babies as well as enough in supply to meet the demand. \nThe $\\$1,000$ in diapers will help Abigail Pregnancy Services keep up with the demand of diapers for sizes 3-5. Clients are always in need of these sizes, and these are the sizes that never seem to be donated to the center. This will allow the center to stock up so that the demand is met with an adequate supply."

        "text": "# \nJuly 2016 â€“ June 2017 \n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\nPersonnel & $75,000 \\\\\nStaff Mileage & $1,000 \\\\\nOffice Supplies & $5,000 \\\\\nPre-Natal/Diagnostic Services & $10,000 \\\\\nMarketing\\&MediaActivities & $4,000 \\\\\nParticipant Education & $2,000 \\\\\nParticipant Support & $1,000 \\\\\nOther: Formula & $1,000 \\\\\nOther: Diapers & $1,000 \\\\\nTOTAL: & $100,000 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nWith the addition of an ultra sound machine, it is anticipated that Abigail Pregnancy Services will add a part-time nurse by next year to be able to offer the clients limited-ultrasounds. The salary of the nurse is dependent on the grant from ODJFS, and this is why the personnel budget jumped to $\\$75,000$ for the second year budget. \nThe staff mileage continues at $\\$1,000$ so that the new nurse on staff can go to a training on performing limited-ultrasounds at a crisis pregnancy center. \nWith the ultra sound machine up and running, both new parenting classing running, and in increase in formula and diapers, it is anticipated that the center will do more promotions with print material. This is why the price of office supplies increased to $\\$5,000$ . This will cover all of the print materials. \nThe $\\$10,000$ is designated to the diagnostic services to help replenish the gel that the nurse will use as well as have that money designated incase anything needs a repair. \nWith the new and expanded programs all settled in by July 2016, Abigail Pregnancy Services would like to continue to broadcast the new and expanded services on the radio and also expand to be able to advertise in other publications such as the business journal and the local tv station. This is why the marketing budget increased to $\\$4,000$ . \nThe $\\$2,000$ is to help restock on the print materials that get handed out to clients that participate in the parenting programs. These will be restocked in English and Spanish. \nThe $\\$1,000$ will be designated to the purchasing of the infant car seats as the graduation present for the new graduates of the parenting class. \n$\\$1,000$ is designated to cover new formula and another $\\$1,000$ is designated to cover more diapers. These are two items that are always in need by clients and neither are reusable which means there must always be a budget to buy more cans of formula and more diapers for the babies."
