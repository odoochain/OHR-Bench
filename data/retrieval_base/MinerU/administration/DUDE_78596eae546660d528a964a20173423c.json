Despite    the  challenges  FPA   has encountered, it has withstood its mandate in the pursuit of serving the Filipino farmers by making available quality fertilizer and pesticide products at reasonable prices. \n\nThe completion and publication of the Fertilizer Regulatory Policies and Implementing Guidelines or the Bluebook serves as a guide to the different fertilizer industry stakeholders as well as the general public. The Bluebook  outlines the  guidelines and procedures for  fertilizer product registration  and issuance  of licenses  to  different  fertilizer handlers. \nIn addition, the Laboratory Services Division has been in full operation in 2013, analyzing different primary, secondary macronutrients and micronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron, manganese, zinc and other agricultural chemicals. \nWith   strong   collaboration   of  the   FPA  with   the   National   Law Enforcement Coordinating Committee (NALECC), Philippine National Police (PNP), Department of Justice (DOJ), National Bureau of Investigation (NBl), the FPA was able to apprehend fertilizer and pesticide smugglers and violators, where the cases are now filed in different courts of the Philippines. \nWith the commitment and dedication of all FPA personnel and the cooperation of different fertilizer and pesticide stakeholders, we at the FPA, can fully attain our mandate of providing our farmers quality fertilizers and pesticides necessary to maximize farm productivity and ensure the food security of the country as well as in protecting the public from the risks inherit in the use of pesticides. \nThank you and more power to all!"

The registrant companies must comply with all the requirements of the FPA prior to the approval of the products being registered. \nFor the year 2013, a total of 1,781 F/P products were registered, in which 1,291 belong to pesticide and 490 to fertilizer. \n\n\n# \nStorage   of  fertilizers  and   pesticides  poses potential risk to ground or surface water. For this reason, the FPA requires that all fertilizer and pesticide warehouses be registered with this  Agency  and comply with all the government regulations on the proper storage  and handling of  all fertilizer and pesticide products. It  is essential then that a warehouse/storage is properly  sited, designed, constructed and operated. \nDuring the year, 340 warehouse applications were approved in the Central Office while 613 applications were renewed in the Regional Offices, or a total of 953 approved applications."
