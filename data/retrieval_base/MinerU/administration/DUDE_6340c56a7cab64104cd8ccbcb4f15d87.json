They store floodwater, trap nutrients and sediment, help recharge ground water, provide habitat and food for wildlife, and add beauty to the landscape. Wetlands filter pollutants out of runoff to help make water cleaner. Wetlands help prevent floods, control erosion, and protect shorelines from being damaged by waves. Quality timber is produced in wetlands. Livestock graze on wetlands. Wetlands offer places for educational activities and scientific research. \nAmerica'swetlands arealivewith nearly 5,000 species of plant life. One-third of all species of birds, 190 species of anphibians, and all of America's wild ducks and geese need wetlands to live. Threatened and endangered species such as the whooping crane, bald eagle, red wolf, fatmucketmussel,and swamp rose depend on wetlands. (For more information on wetlands, ask for the NRCS/RCA lssue Brief 4 “Wetlands Values and Trends,\" November 1995.) \n# \nIn 1972 Congress passed the first Clean Water Act, which established theFederal Government's role in protecting wetlands. This was followed by President Carter's Executive Order 11990, which restricted Government involvement in activities that could lead to the destruction of wetlands. Since, the 1985 Food Security Act (FSA) and the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act (FACTA) have increased wetland protection efforts. \n1985 Food Security Act (FSA)- The Swampbuster provision of this law applied to farmers who con\nverted wetlandstocropland after December 23, 1985. With s0me exceptions, farmers who produced annually tilled crops--such as corn, soybeans, and wheat—on newly converted wetlands jeopardized their eligibility for certain U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) farm programs. The trigger for Swampbuster violations was the planting of an annual crop on a converted wetland. \n1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act (FACTA) FACTA changed the trigger for Swampbuster violations to when wetlands are actually drained, dredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise altered to make possible the production of an agricultural commodity. The law allows producers to convert frequently cropped wetlands, but only if they mitigate the loss by restoring a converted wetland with equivalent wetland functions. FACTA also established the Wetlands Reserve Program, which allows farmers to voluntarily sell easements to the Government for wetlands restoration purposes. \nThe President's plan-In addition to the statutory requirements, on August 24, 1993, the Clinton Administration released a plan providing for “a fair, flexible, and effective approach\" to protecting wetlands, and reforming how the Federal Government regulates wetlands. Key points include: \nNRCS is the lead Federal agency responsible for identifying wetlands on agricultural lands under both the Clean Water Act and FSA. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers established deadlines for decisions on wetlands permits under the Clean Water Act and is establishing an administrative"

The Corps and EPA agreed to final regulations ensuring that approximately 53 million acres of prior-converted cropland will not be subject to wetland regulation. NRCS, the Corps, EPA, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will use the same procedures to identify wetlands; they issued new guidelines for establishing mitigation banks to offset wetland losses. (A mitigation bank is a wetland area that has been restored, created, or enhanced, and that has been set aside to compensate for future conversions of wetlands.) \nMemorandum of Agreement Concerning Delineation of Wetlands (MOA)To carry out the President's reforms, in January 1994 EPA and the Departments of Agriculture, Army, and the Interior signed a joint agreement to use existing authorities to ensure that wetlands programs workbetter among the Federal agencies. It ensures that NRCS,FWS, EPA,and the Corps provide greater certainty and uniformity in decisions to customers requesting wetland delineationsforSwampbusterand/orSec tion 404 of the Clean Water Act. The basic purpose of the MOA was to have EPA and the Corps accept NRCS wetlands determinations on agricultural lands as the final Government decisionfor CleanWater Act purposes. \nThe MOA strongly emphasizes interagency coordination at the field level. Agency personnel conducting wetland delineations must be properly trained and must use standard, agreed-upon methods called mapping conventions. \nIs current wetlands protection adequate?-In a 1995 survey conducted by the Gallup organization to ascertain attitudes toward agricultural natural resource conservation, respondents were \nasked whether they thought that regulations protecting agricultural wetlands had gone \"not far enough\" or \"too far\" or were \"about right.\" More than 4 of $10~\\mathrm{re}$ spondents thought the laws protecting agricultural wetlands had not gone far enough, and a somewhat smaller percentage thought the laws were about right. \nRegulation--The two most important Federal regulatory wetlands programs that directly affect farmers are the Section 404 permitting program and Swampbuster. Swampbuster discourages the conversion of wetlands for agricultural production by denying USDA farm program benefits to individuals who choose to convert wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires individuals to obtain a permit from the Corps before discharging dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including most wetlands. \nMost routine, ongoing farming activities do not require individual Section 404 permits. Many normal farming, silvicultural, and ranching activities that involve discharges of dredged or fill materials into wa\nters of the United States are exempted from Section 404.General permits are issued to the public at large to authorize specific activities that have minimal environmental impacts, such as bank stabilization activities, construction of farm buildings, or wetland restoration activities. Some general permits require notification of thelocal Corps office, and most impose specific conditions. \n# \nworks with other government agencies and private groups to help restore and use wetlands in ways that balance environmental responsibility and profitability. Several Federal programs that benefit wetlands are available. Voluntary, incentive-based programs offer technical and/or financial assistance to help landowners make the mostofvaluabiewetlandresources. \n# \nThe Wildllife Management Institute recently established realistic goals for stabilizing and restoring wildlife populations, and estimated landscape changes necessary to meet those goals.

        "text": "# \nWetlands conservation is one of the most important and sensitive environmental issues in our country today. USDA supports partnerships with other government agencies, tribes, and private organizations to help landowners restore and conserve wetlands. Here are some examples of partnerships at work: \nIn southeastern Missouri, six farmers worked with NRCS and the Butler County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) to create a 38-acre wetland in exchange for converting several small, degraded wetlands in their fields to cropland. Under Swampbuster, farmers who receive USDA benefits cannot destroy wetlands unless they create new ones with similar values. The farmers were offered the option of moving their small wetlands to the 38-acre site, which was purchased by the Butler County SWCD. The larger wetland replaces several small, degraded monoculturewetlandsand includes open water, emergent marsh, and well-developed stands of bottomland hardwoods. Farmers win because they can level and fill their entire fields and irrigate more efficiently. Society wins because wetland values are protected and enhanced while improving the efficiency of producing the Nation's food supply. \nIn North Dakota, a coalition of State and Federal agencies has been cooperating in the development and implementation of the North Dakota State Water Bank Program. To date, about 175 acres of wetlands have been \nrestored and more than 1,000 additional acres of wetlands are being protected. Nearly 2,500 additional acres of upland were placed in the program to provide wildlife habitat and wetlands protection. The program is administered by the North Dakota Department of Agriculture with assistance from the State Game and Fish Department, State Water Commission, NRCS, and FWS. The agencies help developWaterBank Program guidelines and help review, rank, and monitor program contracts. \nA farm family in east-central Illinois restored 10 wetlands totaling about 20 acres on their property, and they plan to conduct several more restoration projects. They are participating in a project through the University of Illinois to study the effectiveness ofwetlandsin \nfiltering nitrate and other pollutants from water running out of tile drainage systems. They have opened a commercial hunting preserve on their property, demonstrating to other farmers that wetlands protection can offer both financial and ecological rewards. \nThe Lake Lafayette Wetland Restoration Project in northern Mississippi is a good example of numerous partners working together: Lake Lafayette, a 2,000- acreforested wetland complex adjacent to Steele Bayou, has been partially drained, and most of the historic floodwaters have been diverted by major floodcontrol projects. Under the sponsorship of the Issaquena Soil and Water Conservation District, six landowners, NRCS, the Mississippi Partners for Waterfowl Program, Mississippi River Levee Board, and FwS \nWildflowersprovidecolorinanewfarmer-createdwetlandthe resultofsixMissourifarmersworkingwithNRCSandtheButler County Soil and Water Conservation District.

The Alliance helps coordinate and provides a focal point for efforts to advance voluntary wetlands restoration and conservation by private landowners. It strongly encour ages and supports establishing \nState and local alliances. Existing wetland projects with Ducks Unlimited, Wildlife Habitat Council, government agencies, and privatelandowners demonstrate how and why valuable wetland habitats should be restored and protected. \nThe Alliance brings together governmental agencies and nongovernmentalorganizationsto funnel assistance directly to landowners. More than 2.5 million landowners are reached annually through publications, workshops, and demonstration projects of participating partners in the Alliance. \n# \nWetlands are vital and dynamic ecosystems. Preserving, enhancing, and restoring wetlands are important parts of USDA's commitment to ecosystem-based assistance. By expanding partnerships and continuously evaluating existing programs, the quality and quantity of our Nation's wetlands will not be ignored. NRCS will continue to work with landowners, conservation districts, State natural resource agencies, FwS, Corps, and EPA to help restore, enhance, and manage valuable wetlands. Everybody can protect valuable wetlands on their property, learn about the wetlands in their community, and take part in local restoration activities. \nThe United States Department of Agriculture, through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service), is preparing an environmental scan of the status, conditions, and trends of natural resources on America's non-Federal land, as requiredbytheSoilandWaterResourcesConservationActof 1977 (RCA),Public Law 95-192.
