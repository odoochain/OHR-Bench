        "text": "Cattle fever ticks Boophilus annulatus and Boophilus microplus spread bovine piroplasmosis--a severe and often fatal disease of cattle. It is also lmown as cattle tick fever, southern cattle fever, splenetic fever,and Texasfever. \nTick larvae hatch from eggs laid on the ground, become attached to animals occupying infested premises, feed upon the host animal--and thus transmit the disease--molt, mate, and the engorged female drops to the ground to deposit her eggs and thus the ticks are perpetuated. \nAn all-out eradication program was instituted in 1906. Thirty-seven years later, in 1943, the tick had been eradicated from the United States, except for a narrow buffer zone under Federal and State quarantines along the Texas-Mexico border. There, reinfestations occur from time to time and an active program is required to prevent additional spread into adjacent areas. Reinfestations have also occurred in California and in Florida from time to time. \nThe eradication program includes inspection, quarantine, and dipping of infested animals. \n# \nPrevention--keeping the ticks out of the United States--is a major part of the effort against cattle fever ticks. A quarantine zone is maintained along the international boundary and the lower Rio Grande River in eight Texas counties as adjacent areas in Mexico are infested. Cattle from Mexico are carefully inspected for ticks at the border. They must be free of ticks and must be given a precautionary dipping before they can be imported. \nWithout these controls, cattle fever ticks would reinfest areas of the United States that have warm climates. In spite of continued efforts to keep out these parasites, they have reappeared from tine to time, but vigilance and prompt eradication measures have eliminated the outbreaks. \nShould the ticks gain a foothold, piroplasma-carrier cattle imported from Mexico could furnish reservoirs leading to heavy losses in our cattle population."

        "text": "All tarritory in Mexico adjacent to the international boundary along the lower Rio Grande River is tick infested, and reinfestations in Texas by ticks carried by Mexican animals illegally entering the United States occur regularly. The river, serving as the boundary, is not an effective barrier against such illegal movements. A buffer area, under Federal and State quarantine, extends from Del Rio to the Gulf of Mexico, aproximately 500 miles. This zone is constantly patrolled by Department inspectors who, in cooperation with Tezas livestock sanitary authorities, work diligently to reduce the introduction and prevent the dissemination of the ticks. The ares under quarantine includes parts of Cameron, Hidalgo, Kinney, Maverick, Starr, Val Verde, Webb and Zapata Countle8. \n# \nFISCAL YEARS 1959THROUGH1964ANDIN1952 ,PROGRESS IN PUERTO RICO AND THE U.

        "text": "Equine piroplasmosis (EP) was first diagnosed in the United States in Florida in August 196l. As of 0ctober 15, 1964, the disease has been diagnosed in 145 horses on 92 premises in Florida. In 1962 four cases were laboratory confirmed in a Georgia herd. This was the first known incidence of the disease in the United States outside of Florida. It is believed to have been limited to one premises in Coffee County. The infected horses in Georgia were slaughtered and balance of herd was tested by passing blood into susceptible recipient horses with no evidence of infection. One case of EP was diagnosed (by demonstration of piroplasma bodies in red blood cells) at a military base in Puerto Rico in July 1964. \nWorld literature reports that equine piroplasmosis is caused by Babesia caballi or Nuttallia equi and can be fatal to 5 - 50 percent of the animals infected. To this date only Babesia caballi has been identified in the United States as a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis and it has been fatal to approximately 20 percent of the animals known to be infected. \nWorld-wide, at least fifteen species of ticks have been incriminated or proven to be vectors of the disease. Of these, at least two are definitely present in the United States: Rhipicephalus sanquineus, the brown dog tick, and Dermacentor nitens, the tropical horse tick. \nThe tropical horse tick (Dermacentor nitens) is a one-host tick. It was first reported in Jamaica and Santo Domingo in 1897; later in Argentina, Columbia, Central America, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, and Trinidad. Heavy infestations were found in the ears of horses in a 1imited area in Texas as early as 1907. This tick is quite common in Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands and is found on both cattle and horses. Collections have also been made from sheep, goats, mules,and deer. \nUnconfirmed evidence indicates the presence of the tropical horse tick in Florida in 1947. However,it was not positively identified there until 1958. Research workers at Beltsville provided conclusive evidence that the tropical horse tick is capable of transmitting EP and that the disease can be transmitted in a \"hereditary\" manner by ticks which are the progeny of ticks that have fed on an infected horse. It is not known how many generations of ticks can successively transmit piroplasmosis in this \"hereditary\" way. \nDetection of equine piroplasmosis is difficult. Reliance is placed on finding the protozoa in the red blood cells. The parasites are most common in the peripheral circulation from the second to the fifth day following appearance of clinical signs; thereafter they gradually disappear. After death, the organisms may be found more readily in smears made from spleen, liver, and kidneys. Research is currently underway to develop a serological test. This work is showing promise. \nRecommended controls for the disease include vector control, precautions against mechanical transmission, prompt reporting, and control of infected animals。 \nResearch work and field trials are being conducted in Florida. In this work.   \nthe effectiveness of several tickicides is being evaluated."

        "text": "Dr. R. L. Park, Animal Husbandman, Virgin Islands Agricultural Program, and Mr. Agustin Quintero (livestock inspector of the Animal Disease Eradication Division force in Puerto Rico) surveyed twelve lots of sheep and goats on the island of St. Croix to determine whether these species were infested with Boophilus microplus or Dermacentor nitens. Their survey of the twelve premises disclosed B. microplus infestations on two lots of goats and six lots of sheep. Dermacentor nitens ticks were also collected from two of the lots of sheep. Neither B. microplus nor D. nitens ticks were found on the sheep or goats examined in six lots. The one deer examined was infested with B. microplus ticks. \nWILD LIFE TICK SURVEY TURNS UP INTERESTING COLLECTION \nTaxonomists at the Beltsville ADE Ectoparasite Laboratory recently identified Ixodes affinis (Neumann 1899) ticks in a routinely submitted collection from South Carolina. The specimens were collected from three white-tailed deer in Dorchester County. This species of tick, although reported frequently in Central and South America, has rarely been reported in the United States. \nThere are published reports of its occurrence on lynxes in Florida in 1948 and 195l, on a dog in Florida in l95l, and on deer inhabiting an island off the coast of Georgia in 1960. Other recorded hosts in southern Mexico and Central and South America have been coati, ocelot and puma. \nCertain stages of this species are extremely difficult to differentiate from the species of Ixodes commonly found in the United States, Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus, especially with regard to unengorged females. \nLittle is known of the role these ticks might play as vectors in the transmission of livestock diseases. However, finding them points to the significance of the nationwide tick survey and the potential it provides as an excellent screening method for early detection of Boophilus and other exotic ticks, should they gain entrance into the United States. \n# \nConsiderable work was done in revising the section on ticks, first distributed in August 1961, of the Field Manual on Veterinary Entomology. Drawings have been improved considerably and written material amplified. The revision is in print and should be out soon. \n# \nEmphasis on the importance of collecting ticks from all livestock species for identification continued during FY 1964. A total of 2,592 lots of ticks were received and identified at the ADE Ectoparasite Laboratory, Beltsville, Maryland. During the same period, 216 mite specimens and 84 miscellaneous ectoparasite specimens were identified. Approximately 13,019 lots of suspected screwworm larvae were received and identified. 0f these, some 5,226 lots were identified as screwworms; the remainder being classed as other various species of blow fly larvae."

        "text": "In December 1963 one male Ambloyomma hebraeum, (the bont tick), was found on a white rhinoceros at the Lincoln Park Zoo, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The animal had been caught in Zululand, South Africa, in April 1963 and had arrived in the United States in August 1963. \nPreviously, in August 1962, two male A. hebraeum ticks had been found in the ear of a white rhinoceros at the Cetskill Game Farm, New York. This animal had also originated in Zululand. \nA. hebraeum, a three-host tick, is capable of parasitizing a variety of domestic as well as wild animals, small mammals, fowl, and man. All stages of the tick may live unfed for long periods--in the case of the adult, up to 450 days. In addition, the male may remain attached on a host for periods up to 8 months. This exotic species has considerable economic significance since it is a vector of the rickettsial causative agent of heartwater in cattle, sheep, andgoats. \nAmblyomna Incisum Ticks Found \nMale ticks identi.fied as A. incisum Neumann) were collected in April 1964 from a South American tapir acquired by a New York City zoo the previous month. Only five specimens of this species have been reported (described by two investigators, Neumann and Aragao) since 1906. These were fcund on Canis spp., and Cervus spp., anteater, and the South American tapir, in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Brazil. The biology of the tick has not been determined. As far as is known, it is not a vector of any animal disease. \nTicks Found on Recently Imported Iguanas \nTicks were observed at a Walla Walla, Washington, pet show on South American iguana lizards and In the litter accompanying the shipment of April 7, 1964, to Washington from Florida. Unfortunately, no specimens were obtained. However, the iguanas and litter were destroyed. \nGenerally speaking, ticks found on cold-blooded animals such as snakes or lizards are not a threat to livestock. The reptilian ticks are rather host specific and we kmow of no research which incriminates them as vectors of livestock diseases. Nevertheless, several vectors of exotic livestock diseases, such as Amblyomma variegatum and A. hebraeum, have been reported fromreptiles. \nThe iguana tick, A. dissimile, is not known to transmit diseases to livestock and is only rarely reported from mammals. However, unless a positive identification is made, there is always the remote possibility that a reptile could be infested, not with an apparently harmless iguena tick, but with an exotic tick such as A. hebraeum commonly found on livestock. \nLone Star Tick Collected at Port \nA male Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) was collected from a wooden container in foreign commerce removed at the Baltimore port. \nEXOTIC TICKS COLLECTED AT WILD ANIMAL COMPOUNDS AND ZOOLOGICAL PARKS DURINGRECENTYEARS \nAMBLYOMMA GEMMA; A. HEBRAEUM; A. SUBLAEVE; A. LONGIROSTRE; A. ROTUNDATUM; AMBLYOMMA or HYALOMMA SPP.; APONOMMA LATUM Or APONOMMA SPP.; IXODES HEXAGONUS; DERMACENTOR RETICULATUS; RHIPICEPHALUS EVERTSI EVERTSI; R. EVERTSI MIMETICUS or R. PULCHELLUS ticks were collected frOm ELAND, NILGAI, ORYX, ZEBRA, ZEHORSE, CAMEL, ABYSSINLAN ASS, HARTEBEEST, GIRAFFE, RHINOCEROS, PANGOLIN, PORCUPINE, or SEVERAL SPECIES OF REPTILES in the States of TEXAS, ILLINOIS, MICHIGAN, CALIFORNIA, PENNSYLVANIA, WASHINGTON, NEW YORK, Or FLORIDA."
