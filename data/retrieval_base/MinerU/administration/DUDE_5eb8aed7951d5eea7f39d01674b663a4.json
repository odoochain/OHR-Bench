        "text": "Medical Records Management in the Naval Service has, in the past ten years, graduated from a relatively simple task into an enormous operation requiring many thcusands of manhours of work. The operation of the program costs millions of dollars each year. In the past, the filing operation in the Pry sical Qualifications and Medical Records Division of the Bureau functicned on a relatively simple basis; however, with the advent of World War Il followed by the establishment of a large Reserve organization and, in turn, the occurrence of the Korean situation, the magnitude of the records keeping problem developed to unforeseen proportions. More recently, with the release of personnel who have performed active duty in the far East, the need for complete medical records available within the Navy Department has become imperative. The need for such complete medical records is occasioned by the (l) processing of disabled members through the physical disability retirement system; (2) adjudication of claims by the Veterans Administration; and (3) the answering of the many inquiries concerning naval personnel. The multitude of benefits which are based upon data in medical records and the awareness of veterans and veterans' organizations to the need for these record constantly brings to our attention the existing problems in this field. \nIn view of the many statutes conferring benefits which accrue as the result of disabilities incurred while in an active duty status in the military service, the ultinate monetary value of complete medical records, to the veteran and to the government, is definitely big business. In fact, as the result of Public Law 35l the Defense Department is presently adjudicating a physical disability benefits program which $\\cdot$ in dollar value may approximate the comparable programs of the entire insurance system within the United States. As a consequence of the numerous laws and regulations adninistered by the Veterans Administration, pertaining to ex-service personnel and their dependents or next of kin, the overall number of persons that will be entitled to sone type of compensation which may be directly attributable to the perfornance of active military service is constantly increasing. It may be of interest to point out that, in the event the Department of Defense should be maintained at its present personnel. level. for the next nine years, there will be approximately sixty-one million persons (or one third of our population) who will be eligible for benefits as the result of having been in active military service or associated with the inactive Reserve. A large percentage of the actual money value of such compensation is awarded on the basis of information available only in the medical records. Therefore, the importance of an adequate and progressive records system within the Medical Department cannot be over-cnphasized. Conversely, however, we should not become guilty of gross over-emphasis on the records keeping systenÂ· \nThere are presently in existence within the government 18,500,000 square feet of records maintained at a yearly space cost of over twenty million dollars. The cost of servicing of these records is additional. Let us consider a hy pothetical situation involving records keeping which I hope will bear enphasis on the specific instances to be mentioned later. There are approximately 2,500,000 so designa.ted active medical records presently on file in the Bureau. In the event one sheet of paper was filed in each of these records it would require l3,0oo inches of file space or the equivalent of 75 five (5) drawer filing cabinets to contain the material. The 70,000 dollars required to provide the filing cabinets, the space and the 2000 manhours to complete this filing operation would appear to be little enough for this number of, let us assume, Standard Form 88's, Reports of Medical Examination. Upon a closer examination of the situation as it tends to exist in practice, however, the first issue referred to, that is the filing of a single report, is brought into the light. It is now apparent that when this original and essential Report of Medical Examination was brought into being it was not alone; the usage rate of this standard form indicates the probability that it may have as many as seven brothers and sisters. Some of these copies are not even justified in a parasitic sense by the existence of the original but rather by the custom of providing a copy for each link in the administrative chain through which the original must pass. Therefore, the resultant predicament, for it is no longer an instance, is not just two and one half million Reports of Medical Examination available at a cost of 70,000 dollars but it is constituted by twenty nillion Reports of Medical Examination pertaining to two and one half million persons, with copies retained in as many as four (4) different activities within the naval establishment, at a cost of 560,000 dollars for the routine task of putting them in filing cabinets. At this point, all of this surplus paper begins to take on the greenish tingo usually found in the tax payer's pocket. The irony of the whole procedurc is finally climaxed by the knowledge that a very large percentage of the personnel to whom these Reports of Medical Examination pertain will not return to any of the activities so zealously retaining a copy of such an examination."

        "text": "It is to be recognized that the example just presented is somewhat drastic; However, it must also be conceded that & mcdified form of the example is universally practiced throughout the naval service. The justification for such a procedure would undoubtedly read as follows:  \"It is highly desirable to retain an extra copy in the files just in case someone shculd require same\". Therefore, it is quite apparent that, in the heat of accomplishing the desirable, the question of necessity is being fried to a crisp - which brings up the second of the specific instances. \nA review of represcntative cross sections from each group of clinical records retired to the Records Management Center, Garden City, Long Island indicates that a considerable duplication in records keeping is being practiced in a large percentage of our activities having facilities for inpatients.  An overall figure of fifty (5o) percent is not unreasonable. and in the case of some activities all of the clinical records contain from One (l) to thrce (3) copies of the summarization on the Medical History Sheet (NavMed Form H-8) and the same number of copies of the Standard Form 50l and 502 (Diagnostic and Narrative Summaries). In many activities today there are clinical records, considered to be in a. closed status because the petient has long since returned to duty, that contain standard forms of the clinical series from 50l to the 520's; yet in many cases as few as ten (i0) of these forms have any information on then. This creates a management problem in thrce ways; First, it is a flagrant waste of expensive forms; Second, it causes the use of an umdue amount of storage space; and Third, by virtue of the shortage of manpower allocated to the departmental level"

        "text": "it would be neither practicablemr possible for the Records Center to review all of the retired clinical records and strip out all copies of the record and all unused forms. Therefore, the obvious place to put a stop to such procedures is at the originating activity. \nOne other instance of unnecessary work in records preparation is considered worth mentioning. Article 23-302 of the Manual of the Medical Department sets forth instructions concerning the retirement of records. The instructions state that each box shall be labeled with the number of sequence in the series and that an inventory of the contents will be enclosed within each container. It is the general interpretation throughout the Medical Department that the inventory should be a complete list of the names, rank or rate and date of the particular record. However, this procedure is not required and not desired. The number of the container in the numerical sequence and the names on the first and last record within the box are all that is necessary. A change to this portion of the Manual of the Medical Department is now being written and should be promulgated in the near future. It is anticipated that the change will correct this error of interpretation. Recently a large naval hospital retired a group of records in seventy-eight (78) containers to the Records Management Center. The total inventory involved two hundred and sixty-one typewritten pages. Based on overall nornal standards this would have required cleven (ll) man days of work on the part of a clerk typist. The entire procedure should have required six (6) typewritten pages and approximately two (2) menhours of work. The saving: of over ten (lo) man days could have been profitably utilized for more essential requirenents. \nThe three (3) instances just presented are not mismanagement of records in the true sense of the word, but rather are over-enphasis on the records keeping system. They are the result of an over-zealousness on the part of administrative personnel in implementing the procedures of records management. Unfortunately, it is not probable that personnel at one activity can recognize the overall import of over-emphasis in records keeping. At any one particular activity the unnecessary use of manhours and the retention of unneeded copies of records may appear to be of small consequence. However, when this case is multiplied by the hundreds of activities in the naval service, we arc suddenly faced with the unpleasant task of paying more in critical manhours, materials and dollars for the unnecessary copies than we are required to pay for the essential records. The situation has then evolved into a ma.jor records management problem. \nIn the near future a study will be made of the administrative methods and procedures in naval hospitals. The survey team will be comprised of personnel from the Bureau and the Office Methods Division, Administrative Office of the Navy Department. This group will undoubtedly submit recommendations which it is to be hoped will materially add to the efficiency of the present medical records program. It is not intended, however, to suggest that the present systen in the Naval Service is grossly or seriously inefficient. In the Physical Qualifications and Medical Records Division we are in constant contact with other federal medical records systems and I can assure you that our present program is superior in nature. Personnel from these other records systens have freely stated this point on many"

        "text": "occasions. However, there are areas where further improvement can be effected, some of' which have been mentioned. \nThis brings me to an explanation of the intent of certain new forms and procedurcs in regard to medical records. First is the NavMed Form H-10 (Sick Call Treatment Record). This form was devised with the intent of providing Î±a record of outpatient treatments which could be incorporated in the central file end to obviate the use of cumbersome sick call logs that had  particular affinity for becoming lost prior to ultimate retirement to the Records Center. An enorinous number of manhours is required each year in searching the available sick call logs for information that should be readily located in the health record. There is apparently a general interpretation that the entries on this forn must be typewritten, but this is not the case. It is anticipated that the entries will be made in ink or indelible pencil and will not require any more personnel then were needed to make the entries in the old type sick call logs. It is recognized that in certain activities, such as naval shipyards, where therc is more than one dispensary, tre use of the form may present some difficulties. This does not alter the fact that the shipyards represent an extremely small percentage of all the ships and stations in the naval Service. In an operation as large as the Medical Department records keeping syston we must expect occ.sional need for improvisation at a local level, Such improvisntion must, out of necessity, be left to the discretion of the local authorities. \nRecently instructions were promlgated to discontinue use of the NavMed H-2 and to substitute in licu thereof a copy of the Standard Form 88. This procedure was formulated in view of the duplication of data. on the two forms and the impending chenge over to a new, standard letter size health record. It is estimated that this procedure will result in a saving of four thousand (40oo) man days of work throughout the Naval Service in a twelve month period. \nIt is anticipated that the new health record will be available in the District Publications Offices in u linited supply on l August l952. The instructions governing these new forms will specify the conditions under which the initial usage will be predicated. It is not intended that an overell conversion to the new forms be accomplished immediately. In general, the prescribed use of the forms will be restricted to new appointees, enlistees andreenlistments. \nIt is hoped that this manner of conversion to the new forms wiil not cause a burdensome workload on any particular activity. This bringsme once again to a point previously mentioned. A certain amount of improvisation at local levels is expected and sanctioned. An all encompassing directive pertaining to nedical records must, through necessity, be flexible. No person or group of persons drafting such a directive can foresee and take into account all. of the problems which may arise locally in the implementation of such a program. \nIn conclusion it might be well to point out that the new forms which will comprise the health record of the future are the result of over three years of study on the part of the Interagency Comnittee on Medical Records. This committee is made up of representatives from all agencies of the federal government."
