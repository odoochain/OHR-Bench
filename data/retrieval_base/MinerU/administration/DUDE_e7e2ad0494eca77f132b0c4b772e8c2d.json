        "text": "# \n# \nNovember 8, 2018 \nIt’s clear that to live up to the high bar we set for Google, we need to make some changes. Going forward, we will provide more transparency into how you raise concerns and how we handle them. We will provide better care and support to people who raise concerns. And we will double down on our commitment to be a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace. \nToday, we’re announcing a number of actions to achieve these things. \n# \n# \nArbitration: We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and it still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy), but, we recognize that the choice should be up to you. \nInvestigations Report: We will create a new section in our Investigations Report focused on sexual harassment to show the number of substantiated or partially substantiated concerns over time, by function. It will also discuss trends, disciplinary actions taken, and substantiation percentages. We’ll also summarize, in this annual report, the types of behavior we do and do not terminate employees for. \nPublicly visible workplace policies and processes: We will publicly share our policy on Harassment, Discrimination, Retaliation, Standards of Conduct & Workplace Concerns, as well as our processes, and channels for raising and investigating concerns."

        "text": "Investigations Practice Guide: We’ll commit to implementing & publishing internally an Investigations Practice Guide, outlining expectations for how concerns are handled within Google. This Guide will clearly outline what Googlers can expect during the investigation process and/or how their concerns will be handled. We’ll seek input from Googlers who have participated in the investigations process before finalizing the Guide. We’ll commit to reviewing the Guide annually and updating it as required. \n# \n# \nExtra care: We will create better care services around investigations to support those who have raised concerns. These opt-in care services will include extended counselling and EAP support, check-ins, support for accommodations and leaves, etc. \nBring a colleague: We’ll establish a global process that will allow Googlers to be accompanied by a companion during an HR investigation, or when raising/reporting any harassment or discrimination concerns to HR. We’ll start with a Q4 pilot of sexual harassment concerns to learn from, and scale this to all types of harassment and discrimination concerns in Q1. \nSpecialty team: We will create a specialty team of advisors on the Employee Relations team to look into all sexual harassment and discrimination concerns. \nRevamping the process: We’ll commit to taking a fresh look at each of our channels for reporting concerns, and the processes for looking into them, to ensure claims are handled with empathy and care, and that individuals bringing concerns forward are heard. We’ll launch this in Q1 2019. \nT-V-Cs: T-V-Cs are an important part of our extended community. We investigate all matters in which a complaint is made by a T-V-C against an employee, and require that suppliers do the same for complaints against T-V-Cs and report back to us on any complaints. In addition, we recently broadened the reach of our Supplier Code of Conduct and require Google suppliers to “demonstrate a commitment to identify, measure, and improve a culture of diversity and inclusion through all aspects of workplace management.” This contractual agreement also holds suppliers accountable for  maintaining “a program that provides workers with a means to report grievances anonymously and without fear of retaliation, unless prohibited by law”. We’ll continue routinely reviewing our suppliers for adherence with these provisions. For those suppliers that employ Google’s TVCs, we’ll consider the findings from these reviews in evaluating whether to continue our supplier relationships."

        "text": "# \nCompany OKR: We will recommit to our company-wide OKR around diversity, equity and inclusion again in 2019, focused on improving representation—through hiring, progression and retention—and creating a more inclusive culture for everyone. \n•  Diverse candidate slate: For new or vacated positions at the Director level or above, we’ll commit to having a diverse slate of candidates on the interview short list. Note, there may be some limited exceptions (eg, highly specialized roles or unique skills) that can be approved only at the joint discretion of the VP-level hiring manager and the VP of Staffing and Operations. \nChief Diversity Officer (CDO) Google’s Chief Diversity Officer will continue to lead monthly discussions with Google Leads and the CEO on topics of diversity, equity and inclusion as well as workplace health.  In addition, the CDO provides recommendations directly to the Board of Directors through the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee on diversity, equity, inclusion and culture matters. \nExcessive alcohol: Harassment is never acceptable and alcohol is never an excuse. But one of the most common factors among the harassment complaints made today at Google is that the perpetrator had been drinking ( $\\sim20\\%$ of cases). Our policy is clear: Excessive consumption of alcohol is not permitted when you are at work, performing Google business, or attending a Google-related event, whether onsite or offsite. Going forward, all leaders at the company - Directors, VPs and SVPs - will be expected to create teams, events, offsites and environments in which excessive alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged. For example, many teams have already put two-drink limits in place for events. Others use drink ticket systems. The onus will be on leaders to take appropriate steps to restrict any excessive consumption among their teams, and we will impose more onerous actions if problems persist. \nReal consequences for not doing training: Starting next year, all employees will complete mandatory sexual harassment training annually (currently required every two years). Employees out of compliance with any required training will be docked one rating in the year end Perf cycle (e.g., Exceeds Expectations will be moved to Consistently Meets Expectations). This applies to all Googlers including our senior leaders. \nNoogler training: We’ll enhance our Noogler training to specifically focus on educating Nooglers on our Harassment, Discrimination and Workplace Conduct policies, and share more about our processes for reporting concerns, and resources available to support employees, setting a strong expectation from Day 1. We’ll also incorporate this information into our Google TVC Onboarding program, providing a uniform opportunity for our TVCs to understand policies, processes, and resources available to them."
