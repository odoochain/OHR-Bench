(ISSN 0195-4520) \nBy Mark DiCamillo and Mervin Field \nHaving served about nine months into what is essentially his third term as governor, Jerry Brown's job performance is viewed favorably voters.  Statewide $49\\%$ approve and $32\\%$ disapprove of the job Brown is doing. \nThe governor's ratings are considerably better than those given the state legislature.  That body is viewed favorably by just $20\\%$ , while $65\\%$ disapprove.  In addition, the Poll finds that voters hold negative views about both Democratic and Republican members, with majorities disapproving of the job that each party is doing. \nCalifornians offer a mixed assessment of the spending cuts made by Brown and the legislature in this year's state budget.  About one in four voters $(27\\%)$ thinks the budget cuts went too far, while one in three $(33\\%)$ believe they didn't go far enough.  Another $29\\%$ think they were about right. \nHowever, by a greater than two to one margin ( $66\\%$ to $24\\%$ ), voters disapprove of the provision in the state budget agreement that calls for automatic spending cuts to be made in many of the state's major program areas, including the K-12 schools, higher education and health care, if tax revenues do not meet original assumptions. \nThese are the findings from the latest Field Poll conducted in English and Spanish among a random sample of 1,001 registered voters September 1–12. \n# \nBrown's approval rating with voters has remained largely unchanged in three Field Poll measurements taken this year.  In March $48\\%$ of voters approved, in June it was $46\\%$ , while now $49\\%$ of voters say they approve of his performance."

        "text": "# \nIn contrast to Brown's generally positive job appraisal, the state legislature is viewed in a very negative light by voters.  This continues a trend that has been in evidence in each of ten previous Field Poll surveys over the past three years. \nAt present, just one-fifth $(20\\%)$ of voters approve of the way Sacramento lawmakers are doing their jobs, while $65\\%$ disapprove.  Fifteen percent have no opinion. \nWhile all partisan groups – Democrats, Republicans and non-partisans – view the legislature negatively, the extent of disapproval varies.

        "text": "# \n# \nThe findings in this report are based on a Field Poll survey completed September 1-12, 2011 among a random sample of 1,001 registered voters in California. In order to cover a broad range of issues and minimize respondent fatigue, some of the questions in this release were asked of a random subsample of 520 voters. \nInterviewing was conducted by telephone in English and Spanish using live interviewers working from Field Research Corporation’s central location telephone interviewing facilities. Up to six attempts were made to reach, screen and interview each randomly selected voter on different days and times of day during the interviewing period. \nInterviewing was completed on either a voter’s landline phone or a cell phone depending on the source of the telephone listing from the voter file. After the completion of interviewing, the overall registered voter sample was weighted to Field Poll estimates of the characteristics of the registered voter population in California by region, age, gender and party registration. \nSampling error estimates applicable to the results of any probability-based survey depend on sample size as well as the percentage distribution being examined. The maximum sampling error estimates for results based on the overall registered voters sample is $+/-3.2$ percentage points at the $95\\%$ confidence level, while findings based on voters included in the random subsample have a maximum sampling error of $+/-4.4$ percentage points. The maximum sampling error is based on results in the middle of the sampling distribution (i.e., percentages at or near $50\\%$ ). Percentages at either end of the distribution (those closer to $10\\%$ or $90\\%$ ) have a smaller margin of error. \nThere are other potential sources of error in surveys besides sampling error. However, the overall design and execution of the survey sought to minimize these other possible sources of error. \nThe Field Poll was established in 1947 as The California Poll by Mervin Field, who is still an active advisor. The Poll has operated continuously since then as an independent, non-partisan survey of California public opinion. The Poll receives annual funding from media subscribers of The Field Poll, from several California foundations, and the University of California and California State University systems, who receive the data files from each Field Poll survey shortly after its completion for teaching and secondary research purposes. \n# \nThinking about this state overall, do you think things in California are generally going in the right direction or do you feel things are seriously off on the wrong track?\\* \nDo you approve or disapprove of the way Jerry Brown is handling his job as Governor of California? \nOverall, do you approve or disapprove of the way the California state legislature is doing its job?\\* \nWhat about the Democrats in the state legislature? Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Democrats in the legislature are doing their job?\\* \nWhat about the Republicans in the state legislature? Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Republicans in the legislature are doing their job?\\* \nHow much confidence do you have in Governor Brown in dealing with matters relating to the state budget – a great deal of confidence, some confidence or not much confidence? \nHow much confidence do you have in the state legislature in dealing with matters relating to the state budget – a great deal of confidence, some confidence or not much confidence? \nWhat is your opinion of the spending cuts that the Governor and state legislature made to pass this year's state budget? Do you think the cuts in state spending went too far, not far enough or were about right? \nOne of the provisions included in this year's state budget is that if state tax revenues in the first half of the year fall short of a certain target, this would trigger automatic spending cuts in program areas like k-12 education, higher education and health care. Do you think that including this provision into the state budget agreement was a good idea or a bad idea?"
