Thank you very much for having this very important hearing. I have been involved with child nutrition since about 1954, when I became a teacher. I see people are there in the background that I have known since I have been here in Congress, 27 years. It is certainly a very, very important program. \nSome people forget that the program really began after World War II when it was discovered that many people entering the military in the draft at that time were physically unable to enter the military because of poor nutrition. Of course, many of them had grown up during the 1930’s, when we had the Great Depression. So it really became apparent to the Federal Government, Franklin Roosevelt, and before him, Harry Truman, that nutrition was very, very important for the long-term health of young people and for the long-term health of this Nation. \nI have been through every permutation that this program has gone under, cash in lieu of commodities, everything, every permutation of that. But generally speaking, the Federal Government has kept its commitment. There are times when we had some problems with trying to call ketchup a vegetable and things like that, which we do muse about from time to time. But generally, all of the Administrations have been aware of the fact that this is a very, very important program."

        "text": "One of the programs I visited recently in my district—Congress established a vegetable pilot program in four different States and one Indian reservation. That was very important. One of the States happened to be Ohio, the other was Michigan. I am not sure how we got in there. But I visited the program in Linden, Michigan and was very, very much impressed. \nI know we always have to go through changes and new ideas. But this program is really one of the great programs, and I would hope that that pilot program would be expanded and that the Department look at that. When Secretary Veneman announced the award of that $\\$6$ million, and that Michigan was one of those, I was determined to go out and visit the programs. You have done a very, very good job in that program and I commend you for it. When I taught school, we had no such thing as a formal breakfast program for students. As a matter of fact, there was a great deal of controversy when the breakfast programs started, the idea that that might weaken the family. But the breakfast program has been very, very important. \nHaving taught school, I could recognize the students who arrived at school not having had breakfast and how that did affect their learning. I started the first breakfast program for one student, at— you have heard me tell that story many times—at Flint Central High School. I had noted that every day in my homeroom, someone’s lunch was being stolen. Very often students packed their lunch and brought it to school. It was being stolen. And I was raised in a family where stealing was a very, very—. \nChairman BOEHNER. Mr. Kildee, nobody attempted to ever steal my lunch. \nMr. KILDEE. Very good. Well, you probably kept a very watchful eye on it. \nChairman BOEHNER. I would have gladly given it to them. \nMr. KILDEE. It was the quality then, right? \nBut I finally caught the young man who was stealing the lunch. And stealing was not only considered a very serious crime in my family, but a sin. So I was going to turn him into the principal who would have suspended him for several weeks. But I found out that his mother was in no position to get him a breakfast in the morning. And whenever he got to school, his first task was to find something to eat. \nBut then he said to me, he said, Mr. Kildee, I never steal the same lunch from the same person in the same week. And I figured, this kid has ethics. So I took him down to the cafeteria where we had no breakfast program, and said to Mrs. Pelkey, who was in charge of the cafeteria, ‘‘Mrs. Pelkey, Robert will be coming down here every morning for breakfast, and you get him something for breakfast and then send me a bill.’’ Well, he got breakfast for 3 years, and I never got a bill. But since then, of course, we have established breakfast programs in many schools. \nSo I look forward to your hearing today. You are involved in something so important. Nutrition is so important. And the Federal Government has a great responsibility in this area. I look forward to your testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

        "text": "Chairman BOEHNER. Thank you, Mr. Kildee. \nI want to introduce our first panel of witnesses today. Our first witness will be the Honorable Eric M. Bost, who is the Department of Agriculture’s Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. As Under Secretary, he is responsible for the administration of the Department’s 15 nutrition assistance programs, including the Food Stamp Program, the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Programs, and WIC. Before his appointment, Mr. Bost served as Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the Texas Department of Human Services. \nOur next witness will be Mr. A. J. Yates, who is the current administrator of USDA’s Agriculture Marketing Service. Mr. Yates oversees more than 50 programs designed to maintain a stable marketing environment for the benefit of America’s farmers, ranchers and consumers. Prior to his appointment, he served as both the Deputy Secretary and the Under Secretary for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. He has been actively involved in providing leadership to a variety of organizations supporting agriculture and education. \nFor those of you that may not be aware, in addition to chairing this Committee, I am also the Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. So I am glad to have both of these gentlemen here. \nMr. Bost, with that you may begin your testimony. \n# \nMr. BOST. Good afternoon, and thank you so very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I am Eric Bost, the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services at the United States Department of Agriculture. I appreciate this opportunity to review the Department’s Commodity Nutrition Assistance Program and consider how this vital program can be enhanced as it relates to the National School Lunch Program. \nAs you know, the Child Nutrition reauthorization process gives the Administration and Congress the opportunity to support local schools, parents, and communities to move toward an environment that values and fosters the health of our children. The commodities are used in school meals in over 98,000 schools nationwide. Over 28 million lunches are served each day in the National School Lunch Program. In fiscal year 2003, USDA provided schools with over 705 million in entitlement commodities and $\\$75$ million in bonus commodities for their school meal programs. \nOf course, the commodity programs are equally important to American farms and ranchers because they provide the Department with a means to stabilize agricultural markets. \nThere has been considerable attention paid to the fat, sodium, and sugar content of school meals. I would like to ensure the Committee of our continuing and abiding concern in this area and share a few of the things that we have done to address this. \nThe Department has, one, reviewed and modified recipes, commodity specifications, and other materials that support compliance with the dietary guidelines. We have also worked with schools to more closely align the meals they serve with the dietary guidelines. We are working hard to improve the quality, variety, and nutritional content of commodities we provide the schools, including offering reduced-fat meat and cheese products, reducing the salt content of canned vegetables, and reducing the sugar added to canned fruit."

        "text": "We have also strongly encouraged schools to offer more nutritious choices to students and provide food service workers with the training and technical assistance to help them prepare more nutritious and appealing meals. Today, over 80 percent of these National School Lunch Program schools, we believe, offer meals that are consistent with good health. \nWe have also asked our partners in industry and State and local agencies for their suggestions in order to identify how we can improve the delivery of the commodity programs to States and schools. Earlier the Chairman made reference to the Food Distribution 2000 report that we use as a blueprint for change. \nThere are a couple of things I would like to say about what we have done to address many of the recommendations, we believe, all of the recommendations that were noted in that report. We have implemented an Internet-based, commodity-based ordering system called the electronic commodity ordering system. This new system provides greater access and speed in food distribution processes at the Federal, State and recipient agency levels. States can now place, cancel, or modify food orders online that previously were handled through paper transactions. We plan to roll the system out in schools, at the State’s option, beginning next year. \nWe have also done some things to align the commodity programs with commercial practices. To bring our commodity programs more in line with commercial practices, we have now allowed vendors to use commercial labels on USDA commodities in lieu of USDA labels; permitted recipient agencies to maintain single inventory records, instead of requiring separate accounting for USDA commodities and commercial products; and reviewed all USDA commodity specifications and improving or modifying them when feasible, to better align them with commercial specifications. \nIn addition to that, we have also revised regulations that allow for full substitution of all commodities with the exception of beef and pork, and with limited substitution for poultry products, which allows processors more flexibility in scheduling their production. \nIn addition to that, we have also initiated a long-term contract for certain commodities, including cheese, some fruits, frozen chicken and turkey products, bringing consistency and predictability to the commodity program. \n‘‘Best value’’ as opposed to ‘‘lowest cost’’ contracts are also being tested to focus on overall product quality and service. There is also a concern to ensure that the food that we serve as a part of this program is also safe. So we have worked very closely with the Department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service to ensure that that occurs. We have established and implemented written procedures and timeframes to address commodity holds and/or recalls resulting from safety concerns. This initiative reduces the hold time on commodities, removes products quickly from schools and other outlets, and expedites product replacement and/or reimbursements."

        "text": "As with other Distribution 2000 initiatives, this was a joint effort by us, the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Marketing Service, the Farm Service Agency, and the Food Safety Inspection Service. In keeping with the dietary guidelines, we have established helpful standards for canned fruit and vegetables offered in our nutrition programs. We have also worked to ensure that we increase and encourage the purchase and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables for our School Lunch Program. \nWe have successfully teamed with the Department of Defense Supply Center of Philadelphia to deliver high-quality fresh produce to school children and Indian tribes. Under this program, participating schools nationwide order fresh produce directly from DOD prime vendors. In fiscal year 2003, USDA purchased $\\$50$ million worth of fresh fruit produce for schools, and the program has proven to be very popular and is currently in about 41 States. \nWith Food Distribution 2000, we have worked cooperatively, as I noted, with all four of the agencies, and I am very pleased to announce that today, later on this afternoon, we will go live with a USDA commodity food network Web site, which allows customers to go to a single portal for all USDA commodity program needs. It is an $\\mathbf{E}$ -government resource designed to provide a wealth of information about the purchase and distribution of USDA’s commodities. This portal combines the resources and information from all four agencies and other partners in the commodity distribution network into a one-stop shopping for our customers. It is no longer necessary to understand the roles of each of the agencies individually, but you are able to go to one place and receive information about how the commodity program works. \nIn conclusion, Mr. Chairman, USDA would be pleased to work with you and this Committee as we embark on reauthorizing the child nutrition programs to ensure the continued improvement and success of our nutrition programs for the Nation’s children and the continued success of our commodity programs. \nMr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. Of course, I am happy to answer any questions that you or the Committee Members may have. \nChairman BOEHNER. Mr. Bost, thank you for your testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bost follows:] \nStatement of Eric M. Bost, Under Secretary of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service \nGood afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I am Eric M. Bost, Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services (FNCS) at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). I appreciate this opportunity to join you once again as you review the Department’s commodity nutrition assistance program and consider how this vital program can be enhanced as it relates to the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). As you know, the Child Nutrition reauthorization process gives the Administration and Congress the opportunity to support local schools, parents, and communities to move toward a nutrition environment that values and fosters the health of our children. \nThe Department of Agriculture is very proud of its commodity programs and the role they play in supplementing and supporting our other nutrition assistance programs. USDA commodities are used in school meals in over 98,000 schools nationwide. In Fiscal Year 2003, USDA provided schools with over $\\$705$ million in entitlement commodities and $\\$79$ million in bonus commodities for their school meals programs. Nationwide, over 28 million lunches are served each day in the National School Lunch Program. Of course, the commodity programs are equally important to American farms and ranches because they provide the Department with a means to stabilize agricultural markets."

        "text": "I would like to begin today by saying a few words about the nutritional aspects of our school meal programs. There has been considerable attention paid to the fat, sodium, and sugar content of these meals. I would like to assure the Committee of our continuing and abiding concern in this area. The Department has reviewed and modified the recipes, commodity specifications and other materials that support compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. \nUSDA has worked with schools to more closely align the meals they serve with the Dietary Guidelines. Today, over 80 percent of NSLP schools offer meals that are consistent with good health. We have worked hard to improve the quality, variety, and nutritional content of the commodities we provide to schools and will continue to make improvements in the future. At the same time, we are strongly encouraging schools to offer more nutritious choices to students and we are providing food service workers with the training and technical assistance to help them prepare more nutritious and appealing meals. \nAs many of you recall, back in the 1990’s, the Department became aware of a growing gap between the way we were delivering our commodity support to schools and the way States, schools and industry could most efficiently and safely produce, deliver, store and serve a quality product. We asked our partners in industry, the State, and local agencies for their suggestions in order to identify how we could close this gap, and we incorporated these recommendations, along with our own, into a report entitled, ‘‘Food Distribution 2000,’’ and used it as a blueprint for change. \nRecognizing and Responding to a Challenge \nThe Food Distribution 2000 Report identified numerous ways in which USDA’s commodity program for schools was overly cumbersome and burdened with red tape. Commodity ordering was handled by seven different regional offices, rather than centrally at USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service headquarters. Orders were submitted on paper, not electronically. \nThe Department’s program was significantly out of step with commercial practices. Vendors were required to use USDA labels on commodities, which entailed running separate production lines and no interchangeable products. The Department required States and recipient agencies to maintain separate inventories for USDA products and account for them aside from commercial products. Specifications for USDA commodities often deviated from the specifications commonly used for commercial products. The vendor contracting process—short-term lowest cost contract awards—made USDA the customer of last resort and created inconsistent and unpredictable product quality and service. \nOther key issues the report addressed were how USDA agencies could better coordinate their efforts, improve food safety protocols, and promote fresh fruits and vegetables. \nI am pleased to report that USDA has addressed each of the issues raised by the Food Distribution 2000 Report, took action, and has now implemented most of the Report’s recommendations, some of which I would like to share with you this afternoon. \nMaking Commodity Programs More Responsive to Customer Needs \nTo make our commodity programs more responsive to our customers, USDA has implemented an Internet-based commodity ordering system called the Electronic Commodity Ordering System (ECOS). This new system provides greater access, speed and transparency to the food distribution process at the Federal, State, and recipient agency levels. States can now place, cancel, or modify food orders online that previously were handled by paper transactions. We plan to roll the system out to schools, at the State’s option, beginning next year. \nAligning Commodity Programs with Commercial Practices \nTo bring our commodity programs more in line with commercial practices, USDA now: \n• Allows vendors to use commercial labels on USDA commodities in lieu of USDA labels;   \n• Permits recipient agencies to maintain single inventory records, instead of requiring separate accounting for USDA commodities and commercial products; and   \n• Reviews all USDA commodity specifications, and improves/modifies them when feasible, to better align them with commercial specifications. \nWe have revised regulations to allow for full substitution of all commodities, with the exception of beef and pork, and with limited substitution for poultry products. Substitution allows processors more flexibility in scheduling production. Through the use of the Standard Yield Program, schools can now obtain seamless distribution of commodities and commercial purchases."

This procurement method brings consistency and predictability to the commodity program. ‘‘Best value’’, as opposed to ‘‘lowest cost’’ contracts are also being tested to focus on overall product quality and service. \nImproving Food Safety Protocols \nTo ensure that the commodities we offer to schools are safe as well as nutritious, all meat and poultry product specifications are reviewed and/or amended in consultation with the Department’s Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). \nGround beef suppliers must operate under new process control protocols similar to those required by large volume commercial buyers of ground beef. \nUSDA has also established and implemented written procedures and time frames to address commodity holds and/or recalls resulting from safety concerns. This initiative reduces the hold time on commodities, removes product quickly from schools and other outlets, and expedites product replacement/reimbursement. As with other Food Distribution 2000 initiatives, this was a joint effort by FNS, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and FSIS. \n# \nAs many of us here today recall from our own school days, the National School Lunch Program of the 1950’s and 60’s served canned fruits and vegetables almost exclusively, and in keeping with the tastes and nutrition knowledge of the times, they were often flavored with plenty of salt and heavy syrup. Since those days, and in keeping with our Dietary Guidelines, we have established much more healthful standards for canned fruits and vegetables offered in our nutrition programs. The sodium specifications for the vegetables we offer to schools are the minimum amount possible that still assures palatability of the products. Canned fruit is packed only in natural juice or light syrup. \nRecently, the Department has embarked on a major effort to increase and encourage the purchase and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables for the school lunch program. \nUSDA has successfully teamed up with the Department of Defense (DoD) Supply Center of Philadelphia to deliver high quality fresh produce to school children and Indian tribes. Under this program, participating schools nationwide order fresh produce directly from DoD prime vendors. In fiscal year 2003, USDA purchased $\\$50$ million worth of fresh produce for schools and the program has proven to be very popular in the 41 States that took part in it last year. \n# \nFood Distribution 2000 has been a collective and unprecedented effort of four USDA agencies. Together, FNS, AMS, FSA, and FSIS have forged a partnership to eliminate inter-agency barriers and work together to bring about major structural changes to the commodity programs our Department administers. The success of these commodity improvement initiatives is due to the commitment, support, and considerable effort put forth by each agency at every level. \nI am proud to announce today that one of our inter-agency partnering goals has resulted in the creation of a one-stop USDA Commodity Food Network (CFN) website. This website—which goes ‘‘live’’ this afternoon—allows our customers to go to a single portal for all USDA Commodity Program needs. It is an e-government resource designed to provide a wealth of information about the purchase and distribution of USDA commodities. This portal combines the resources and information from all four agencies, and other partners in the commodity distribution network, into ‘‘one-stop shopping’’ for our customers. It is no longer necessary to understand the role of an individual USDA agency in order to obtain commodity information. The website enables schools, community feeding sites, State agencies, Native American Tribal Organizations and others to have instant access to information about USDA’s commodities and distribution programs. CFN also provides direct links to other commodity distribution partner websites, such as the American Commodity Distribution Association and the American School Food Service Association. \n# \nMr. Chairman, USDA would be pleased to work with you and this Committee as we embark on reauthorizing the Child Nutrition programs to ensure the continued improvement and success of our nutrition programs for the nation’s children and the continued success of our commodity programs."

        "text": "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. I would be happy to answer any questions. \nChairman BOEHNER. Mr. Yates, you may begin. \n# \nMr. YATES. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to appear before you today to discuss the role of the Agricultural Marketing Service, AMS, in the National School Lunch Program. \nI am A. J. Yates, Administrator of AMS, and I am pleased to be here with Under Secretary Bost. While USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service administers the National School Lunch Program, AMS is responsible for purchasing many of the commodities for this and other domestic food assistance programs. We support the National School Lunch Program, providing nutritious, high-quality food to school children through our purchases of red meat, fish, poultry, eggs, fruit and vegetable products. USDA’s Farm Service Agency purchases flours, grains, peanut products, dairy products, oils and shortening. All of these purchases help to stabilize the agricultural market by balancing supply and demand, thus helping domestic farmers and ranchers. \nLet me briefly describe the purchase process and AMS’s role in it. The process begins long before AMS announces that it plans to purchase particular food items. AMS specialists knowledgeable in food processing work with potential vendors, Food Nutrition Service, and food safety officers in developing specifications for each item that will be purchased. Many of these items are similar to the popular commercial items. \nOther items are developed specifically to meet the special nutritional needs of our recipients. The specification provides details on product formulation, manufacturing, packaging, sampling and testing requirements and quality assurance provisions. By coordinating the development of specifications with specialists from all aspects of food processing, AMS ensures the purchase of high-quality, wholesome, appealing products that meet recipients’ needs and Federal standards for nutrition. \nPrior to conducting any purchase, AMS economists assess market conditions and determine the availability for commodities the agency is considering buying. During this time, AMS also works closely with Food Nutrition Service to determine recipient preferences. Orders are taken by FNS and provided to AMS so that purchases can be made. \nAlthough weekly meal patterns must meet Federal standards, local school authorities make the decisions about what specific foods to serve and how they are prepared. Moreover, USDA’s commodities comprise less than 20 percent of the food products put on school childrens’ plates. AMS and FSA are responsible for issuing and accepting bids and awarding and administering contracts. \nFNS is responsible for taking commodity orders from States, monitoring purchases and entitlements throughout the year, and the overall administration of the commodity nutrition programs."

        "text": "Actual purchasing begins with AMS and Farm Service Agency notifying specific industries, through press releases and other means, of their intent to purchase particular food products. These agencies invite bids under a formal advertised competitive bid program. These invitations give specific details on when bids are due for a particular purchase. All products must be US-produced and of domestic origin. Under Federal acquisition regulations, vendors must be deemed responsible prior to participating in the program. For instance, they must have a satisfactory performance record and adequate financial resources to demonstrate their ability to produce and deliver the product within designated timeframes. \nIt is essential that USDA-purchased food products arrive on time, as recipients depend on it. Bids are received from responsible vendors, analyzed, and contracts are awarded by AMS or Farm Service Agency. Contracts are then administered by the agencies to make sure that the terms and conditions are followed. \nAll products purchased by USDA are produced in compliance with applicable food safety—Federal food safety laws and regulations. Red meat, poultry, and egg products must be processed under USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service regulations. And all fruit, vegetable and fish products are subject to Food and Drug Administration regulations. \nFSIS and FDA ensure that such products are wholesome and that processing plants operate under sanitary conditions. In addition to FSIS inspection, AMS inspectors are present during production and shipping of all red meat and poultry items to ensure compliance with all specification requirements, including those for raw material processing, packaging, and testing. \nPlants supplying processed fruit and vegetable products undergo a survey by AMS inspectors to ensure compliance with FDA requirements, including that agency’s good manufacturing practices. Additionally, fish products are produced in facilities operating under the National Marine Fisheries Service voluntary seafood inspection program. For certain types of products, such as ground beef, egg products and fruit juices, additional product handling and testing protocols are required. \nAMS also works with FSIS to distribute educational materials for food service professionals about proper handling and cooking techniques. These materials are available both in Spanish and English, and are designed to assist food service professionals in every school participating in the National School Lunch Program. As you know, in 1998, USDA policy officials met with representatives of the American School Food Service Association and the American Commodity Distribution Association, with the aim of improving the commodity procurement and distribution process. AMS played a key role in developing and implementing the initiatives contained in the ‘‘Food Distribution 2000—USDA’s Reinvention Plan for Change’’ report. \nSome of the key initiatives contained in this report that AMS has implemented include the expanded use of long-term contracts with proven suppliers; expanded use of best-value contracting; revised product specifications to align them with commercially available products; purchase of commercially labeled products; use of commercial and commodity products interchangeably by further processors in the manufacture of fruit and vegetables products, and, on a more limited basis, poultry products; implemented formal commodity product hold and recall procedures for use by State and local authorities; and relaxed truckload delivery requirements allowing multiple stops within a State or city."

I am A. J. Yates, Administrator of AMS, and I am pleased to be here with Under Secretary Bost. \nIn 1946, Congress passed the National School Lunch Act, providing a healthy lunch to millions of schoolchildren. Over 55 years later, the program continues to help improve the health of children, especially those at nutritional risk. \nWhile USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), AMS is responsible for purchasing many of the commodities for this and other domestic food assistance programs.

USDA’s commodity distribution program really has two objectives. One is to stabilize the agricultural marketplace, and, second, to provide high-quality nutritious foods to Federal nutrition programs. And I am trying to—wearing both of my hats of interest—trying to understand what really drives this process: what is good for the nutrition programs in terms of what the schools want; or is it the economics of the marketplace in terms of the stabilization of certain commodity markets? \nSo I would like to ask both of you, just help me understand which objective wins when it is all said and done."

        "text": "Mr. BOST. Mr. Chairman, let me take a stab at it. I don’t know if it is a question of which objective wins. I think what we have attempted to do in the Department is to ensure that there is a balance, and that essentially they balance one or the other out in terms of us making some decisions that are going to address both entities. \nOn the one side, of course, what the farmers and ranchers produce and they want us to buy; and on the other hand, a very important consideration that we have to give—we are interested in giving to ensure that we provide nutritious, healthy food to the 29 million children in our schools. \nAnd also the other issue of dealing with the bonus buys that are out there. So we try to bring all of those to the table and balance them out in terms of some decisions that we make. \nInterestingly enough, that is why there are essentially two components of the program. One, of course, is entitlements. There are 143—145 items on that list that schools are actually able to order from. The other is bonus buys. The bonus buys afford the Department a great deal of flexibility in terms of when and what they buy and how much. \nAnd so that tends to be somewhat of a lever, because it affords us an opportunity to attempt to balance all of those things out, a challenge. It is a major challenge for us. Because there is a great deal of pressure coming, of course, from one side on occasion, saying ‘‘Well, I want you to buy X.’’ It could be peaches, it could be tree nuts. It could be, ‘‘Well, I want you to buy more beef.’’ . \nOn the other hand, it could be, we are interested in ensuring that the foods that we do buy, one, that we can afford to buy them; and, two, that they are going to meet the nutritional needs of school children. And, most importantly, that even when we do buy them, that the children are going to eat them. We have people who come to see us who are interested in, say, two of my favorites, asparagus and brussel sprouts. You know, there are not too many second graders that that is at the top of their list, you know, in terms of interest and taste. \nSo we try to ensure that we balance all of those things out. \nChairman BOEHNER. Mr. Yates. \nMr. YATES. Mr. Chairman, it is a balancing act. And we at AMS work very closely with FNS. We will have a number of different agricultural commodity groups come before us in a period of time with a statement that our commodity is in surplus, we are having a difficult time. And the first thing that we always do, is we go to FNS and we say, here is what the industry has out there in surplus. Can you use it in any of the school lunch programs? Are the recipients interested in this type of product? \nIt is a very close relationship that we have with FNS in this regard. And as the Under Secretary said, some of these commodities are wanted much more than others. And we look for ways of putting nutritious items together, even if it is a dried fruit mix, that would allow us to use certain commodities that by themselves might not be so appealing to an individual, a young student, but by combining these nutritious dried fruits together, it provides something that was very popular last year in the purchases that we made and the deliveries to the schools."

        "text": "Chairman BOEHNER. In Food Distribution 2000, the panel recommended that specifications be written to resemble, as close as possible, the specifications used in commercial food system procurement. I know the Department has reviewed some of these. But how are we coming in terms of the implementation of all of those recommendations? \nMr. YATES. Well, I think we have been very successful in implementing most of those. One of the issues that the Under Secretary and I both stated in our testimony is the substitution issue in regards to fruit and vegetables. It is fairly broad in substitution there. And it is limited when it comes to poultry and to beef and pork products. \nFor the poultry products, if our inspectors are in the facility where we have continuous inspection, the company can be making either commercial or school product, and actually we allow them to use their own label on the product. And so if it has passed under AMS inspection, those products can be interchanged. \nWith beef, with the new beef specifications that we put in place last spring dealing with microbial testing, we allow no substitution because the health of one of the most at-risk groups of people we have in the country, the young people in school, we are going to assure to the best of our ability that we deliver a product that is safe and healthful. \nAnd so there—our testing begins at the carcass. And it goes through the boneless beef, on to after-processing. What we are looking at now in addressing the issue I think that you had raised is that we would entertain delivering on time to a processor, chilled, boneless beef for further processing that has gone through our inspection process and microbial testing. And I believe that that would provide a product that is more economical, and also a fresher product for school children. \nChairman BOEHNER. I can see my time has expired. We will come back to that after all of the members have had a chance to ask their questions. Mr. Kildee. \nMr. KILDEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We understand that the Department has conducted studies to determine how to reduce overcertification of eligibles. Do you believe that these—that there are program safeguards built into your proposal to reduce overcertification that protect children, and to make sure that we aren’t dropping those that should still be in? And what are these safeguards? \nI have in mind, for example, that I have taught at an inner-city school. We had homeless kids. We had illegal immigrants. We had migrant workers. We had children in barely functional families, if not dysfunctional families. We had really a cross-section. How have you built safeguards in to make sure that in your zeal to reduce overcertification that you weren’t really dropping those who legitimately need program? \nMr. BOST. I think it is real important to note that, first of all, it is not necessarily just overcertification. We are interested in ensuring that every eligible child is able to participate in the program, because we have a significant number of eligible children, that for whatever reason, are not participating. So it is just not overcertification, but it is ensuring that those children that are eli"
