One major objective wns to develop training materials for PSRo staffs and for hospital personnel responsible for collecting and using PHDDS at delegated hospitals. Resulting new materials have been combined with revised Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDs) instructional materials to provide complete instructions for all parts of the PHDDs.
