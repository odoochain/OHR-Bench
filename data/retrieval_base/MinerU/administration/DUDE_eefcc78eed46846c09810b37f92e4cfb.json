        "text": "This health plan meets Minimum Creditable Coverage standards and will satisfy the individual mandate that you have health insurance. \n# \nAs of January 1, 2009 the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law requires that Massachusetts residents, eighteen (18) years of age and older, must have health coverage that meets the Minimum Creditable Coverage standards set by the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector, unless waived from the health insurance requirement based on affordability or individual hardship. For more information, call the Connector at 1-877-MA-ENROLL or visit the Connector website (www.mahealthconnector.org). \nThis health plan meets Minimum Creditable Coverage standards that are effective January 1, 2016 as part of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law. If you purchase this plan, you will satisfy the statutory requirement that you have health insurance meeting these standards. \nTHIS DISCLOSURE IS FOR MINIMUM CREDITABLE COVERAGE STANDARDS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016. BECAUSE THESE STANDARDS MAY CHANGE, REVIEW YOUR HEALTH PLAN MATERIAL EACH YEAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR PLAN MEETS THE LATEST STANDARDS. \nIf you have questions about this notice, you may contact the Division of Insurance by calling 1-617-521-7794 or visiting its website at www.mass.gov/doi. \nFallon Community Health Plan, Inc. \nThis plan includes the tiered provider network. In this plan, members pay different levels of copayments, coinsurance or deductibles depending on the tier of the provider delivering a covered service or supply. This plan may make changes to a provider’s benefit tier annually on July $1^{s t}$ . Please consult the provider directory or visit the provider search tool at fallonhealth.org/gic to determine the tier levels of available providers. \n# \nThis plan covers emergency care worldwide. When you experience an emergency medical condition, you should go to the nearest emergency room for care or call your local emergency communications system (e.g., police or fire department, or 911) to request ambulance transportation. \nYou may obtain health care services for an emergency medical condition, including local pre-hospital emergency medical service systems, whenever you have an emergency medical condition which in the judgment of a prudent layperson would require pre-hospital emergency medical services, and we will provide coverage of emergency services from any provider. \nEmergency services will be covered from all providers at the cost level of the lowest cost-sharing tier regardless of the tier in which the health benefit plan has classified the provider providing such emergency services within the Tiered Provider Network including for inpatient deductibles if the insured seeking or receiving emergency services is subsequently admitted."

Group health plans usually allow subscribers to switch health plans during a designated “open enrollment” period prior to the anniversary date. \nAuthorization: An assurance by the plan to pay for medically necessary covered benefits provided by a network provider for an eligible plan member. In some instances, PCPs are given authority to issue an authorization for specialty care. \nBenefit Period: The 12 month span of plan coverage, and the time during which the deductible, out-of-pocke maximum and specific benefit maximums accumulate. \nCoinsurance: Your share of the allowed charge for certain covered benefits according to the fixed percenta specified in the “Your Cost for Covered Services” section under “Coinsurance.” \nCommission: The Group Insurance Commission, the agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that administers your group health plan. Also referred to as “plan sponsor.” \nContract: The agreement that Fallon has with the Group Insurance Commission to provide benefits to you and your covered dependents. \nCopayment: The fixed-dollar amount you are responsible to pay for certain covered services.

        "text": "Emergency medical condition: A medical condition, whether physical or mental, manifesting itself by symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, with an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of prompt medical attention to result in: (1) serious jeopardy to the health of the member or another person, or, in the case of a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child; (2) serious impairment to bodily functions; or (3) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. \nEmergency services: Inpatient and outpatient services, whether inside or outside the plan service area, that are: (1) furnished by a qualified provider and (2) needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition. \nExperimental/investigational: In cases where a drug, device, treatment or procedure does not meet one or more of Fallon’s technology assessment criteria, the drug, device, treatment or procedure will be considered experimental or investigational.

There is a physician bill and the hospital also bills your insurance company for the staff, supplies, and overhead costs that the hospital is paying so that the hospital based physician has what he/she needs to see you. This second bill from the hospital to your insurance company is called a facility fee. \nFallon Health/Fallon: Also referred to as “the plan,” “us,” “we” and “our”. \nSelect Care service area: The geographical area served by Select Care. The towns and cities in the Select Care service area are included in this Member Handbook/Evidence of Coverage. \nFormulary: A list of prescription medications that are approved for coverage. \nGIC: The Group Insurance Commission, the agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which provides your group health plan.

This may include routine housecleaning and related chores; laundry; food preparation and dishwashing. \nInpatient: A registered bed patient in a licensed hospital or other facility. \nMedical surgical supplies: Special products, such as materials used to repair a wound or instruments used for your care."

        "text": "Technology Assessment Criteria: Fallon maintains a formal mechanism for evaluating medical technologies through our Technology assessment committee. The committee includes physician administrators, practicing physicians from the plan’s service area, and plan staff. When necessary, the committee seeks the input of specialists or professionals who have expertise in the proposed technology. In all cases, the technology is reviewed against the following technology assessment criteria: \n1. The technology must have final approval from the appropriate government regulatory body. This applies to drugs, devices, biologics, and treatments or procedures that must have final approval to market from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other federal governmental body with authority to regulate the technology. Devices must have final FDA approval for the specific indications under evaluation by Fallon.   \n2. The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning the effect of the technology on health outcomes. The evidence should consist of well-designed and well-conducted investigations published in peer-reviewed journals. The quality of the study as well as the results are considered in evaluating the evidence. Opinions by national medical associations, consensus panels, or other technology evaluation bodies are evaluated according to the scientific quality of the supporting evidence.   \n3. The evidence must show that the technology improves health outcomes. Specifically, the technology’s beneficial effects on health outcomes should outweigh any harmful effects on health outcomes.   \n4. The technology must be at least as effective as the established technology. In addition, the technology must be as cost-effective as any established alternatives that achieve a similar health outcome.   \n5. The outcome must be attainable outside investigational settings. \nTerminal illness: An illness as a result of which a member has a life expectancy of less than six months. \nTier: Different levels in which plan specialists and hospitals are placed based on quality and cost-efficiency measures. \nUrgent care: Medical care that is needed right away for minor emergencies, such as cuts that require stitche a sprained ankle or abdominal pain. \nUsual, customary and reasonable charge: An amount that is consistent with the normal range of charges for the same or similar services in the geographical area where the service was provided, as determined by the plan. \nWalk In Clinic: Limited service medical clinics.

Understanding how your health plan works is important. For one thing, it helps you know what to expect. The following information highlights the most important points about how we work to ensure that you receive quality care and services. \n# \nThe Select Care provider network includes providers in Berkshire, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk and Worcester Counties. In order for you to receive coverage for most services, care must be coordinated by your primary care provider (PCP) and administered by a provider in the Fallon network.   \nWhen you join Fallon, you choose a primary care provider (PCP) who coordinates your health care.   \nx Fallon requires prior authorization for certain services and the site of where those services will be provided. \n# \nFallon is committed to giving all our members access to a network of high-quality, cost-efficient plan doctors and hospitals. Fallon Select Care tiers Cardiologists, Endocrinologists, ENTs/Otolaryngologists, Nephrologists, Neurologists, Ob/Gyns, Pulmonologists and Rheumatologists based on quality and cost-efficiency measures. The following specialties are tiered on cost-efficiency measures only: gastroenterology, hematology/oncology, orthopedics, allergy/immunology, urology and podiatry.

The tiering works are as follows: \nTier 1 \\*\\*\\* (Excellent): Plan specialists and hospitals practicing at an excellent level of quality and/or cost-efficiency. You will pay the lowest copayment when you see a Tier 1 specialist or hospital. \nTier $2^{**}$ (Good): Plan specialists and hospitals practicing at a good level of quality and/or costefficiency. You will pay the prevalent, mid-level copayment when you see a Tier 2 specialists or hospital. \nTier $3^{\\star}$ (Standard): Plan specialists and hospitals practicing at a standard level of quality and/or costefficiency. You will pay a higher copayment when you see a Tier 3 specialist or hospital. \nNT/ID: This designation includes specialists that did not have sufficient data for tiering and providers that belong to a specialty or subspecialty that is not being tiered by Fallon. These providers are subject to a $\\$60$ copayment. \nx You may change your PCP at any time.   \nx A referral is not required to see a Reliant Medical Group specialist if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP.   \nx For other covered services, you should obtain a referral from your PCP, and in some cases, your physicia will obtain authorization from the health plan.   \nx Fallon maintains a formulary, or a list of medications, approved for coverage."

        "text": "# \nWhen you join Fallon, you must choose a plan provider as your primary care provider (PCP). Your relationship with your PCP is very important, because he or she will work with us to provide or arrange most of your health care. \n# \nEach covered family member should choose his or her own PCP. This provider can be a: \nx Family practice doctor (for members of all ages) Doctor of internal medicine (for members over 18)   \nx Pediatrician (for members under 18)   \nx Doctor of geriatric medicine   \nx Doctor of adolescent medicine   \nx A nurse practitioner (in appropriate primary care provider specialty listed above)   \nx Physician assistant (must be in a primary care practice) \nThe Select Care Provider Network directory contains the names of plan providers who are available as PCPs, along with their address, admitting hospital(s) and tiering level. If you haven’t selected a PCP and you don’t have a plan provider list, Customer Service will send you a free directory, or provide you with further information on plan providers. You can also visit our website at fallonhealth.org/gic to obtain names of plan providers in your area. \nYou may change your PCP at any time by either calling Customer Service or completing the “Change provider” form on fallonhealth.org/gic. \n# \nOnce you have selected a PCP, please notify Customer Service of your selection. It’s also a good idea to schedule an initial appointment. This will allow your PCP to learn about you and your medical history and to begin assisting you with the coordination of any medical care that you may need. He or she can also help you with questions on \nx Preventive care Prescriptions Specialty care Urgent care services Management of your ongoing medical needs \n# \nIt’s also a good idea to keep your PCP’s telephone number in your wallet and at home by your phone. If you need to see someone right away, your PCP (or an on-call provider) will direct you. Plan providers’ telephones are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week for emergencies and urgent care needs. \nFallon requires the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in our network and who is available to accept you or your family members. Until you make this designation, Fallon designates one for you. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, contact the Fallon Customer Service at 1-866-344-4442 (TRS 711) or visit our website at fallonhealth.org/gic to obtain a list of PCPs in your area. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider."

        "text": "# \nWhen you have health care concerns, a good place to start is by contacting your PCP. Much of the time your PCP can provide the care that you need. Sometimes, however, you may need specialty care or services that your PCP does not provide. \nIf you and your PCP decide that a visit with a network specialist is medically necessary, your PCP will make the arrangements for you. For some services, your PCP is authorized to give you a referral to see a specialist. (See PCP referral.) For other services, your PCP must get authorization from the plan before giving you the referral. (See “Plan prior authorization” below.) If you receive services from any doctor, hospital or other health care provider without getting a referral from your PCP, you will have to pay for these services yourself (with the exception of those services listed under Self-referral below). \nWhen you joined Fallon, you chose Select Care. This means that you must use the health care professionals and facilities in the Select Care network. Remember, your copayments for physician specialist visits are determined by the specialist’s tiering level. You will pay the lowest copayment when you see a Tier 1 \\*\\*\\* (excellent) specialty physician. You will pay the prevalent, mid-level copayment when you see a Tier $^{2^{\\star\\star}}$ (good) specialty physician. You will pay a higher copayment when you see a Tier $3^{\\star}$ (standard) specialty physician. \nNote: Please be aware that specialty physician’s tiering levels will be re-evaluated on an annual basis. The reevaluation may result in a change in the specialty physician’s tiering level; this change takes effect annually on July 1. You should check the annual provider directory or the GIC member portal at fallonhealth.org/gic for annual tiering level changes to specialty physicians. \n# \nIn certain instances, you can “self-refer” to a Select Care network specialist. This means that you can call the specialist and make the appointment yourself. You do not need a referral from your PCP, but you must see a Select Care network provider. \nServices you can self-refer for: \nx Office visits with a Select Care network obstetrician, gynecologist, certified nurse-midwife or family practitioner, including annual preventive gynecological examination and any subsequent gynecological services determined to be necessary as a result of such examination; services for acute or emergent gynecological conditions; and maternity care. It does not include inpatient admissions or infertility treatment (unless provided by a Reliant Medical Group specialist and you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP).   \nx Office visits with a Reliant Medical Group specialist (physician, physician assistant, nurse midwife or nurse practitioner only) if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP. Office visits to a Select Care network oral surgeon for extraction of impacted teeth. (Note: visits to an oral surgeon for any other procedure require authorization) Routine eye examinations with a Select Care network ophthalmologist or optometrist.   \nx Outpatient mental health and substance abuse services with network providers. For assistance in finding a network provider, call 1-888-421-8861 (TDD/TTY: 1-781-994-7660).   \nx Visit to a contracted limited service clinic (appointments not required)."

        "text": "# \nIn some instances your PCP may refer you to a specialist. Your PCP is responsible to ensure that the provider to whom you are referred is within the Select Care network. In most cases, your PCP will refer you for care with specialists and hospitals with whom they have an affiliation. This helps your PCP coordinate and maintain the quality of your care. This means that the PCP you select determines the specialists and hospitals from whom you will receive care. \nIn the rare event that you need specialty care that is not available within your PCP's affiliations, your PCP will refer you to another specialist within the Select Care network. When selecting a specialist for you, your PCP will consider your clinical needs and any active and long-standing relationships with a Select Care network provider. \nServices that need a PCP referral, but do not need authorization from the plan: \nx Office visits with a Select Care network specialist, with the exception of office visits with a Reliant Medical Group specialist if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP. In some instances, your PCP may give you a “standing referral” to a Select Care network specialist for covered services. For a standing referral, your PCP and specialist must agree on a treatment plan, and the specialist must keep your PCP up to date on your treatment. Standing referrals are valid for up to 12 months, as long as the services are medically necessary.   \nx Podiatric care. Your PCP will give you a referral to a Fallon Select Care network podiatrist. The referral is good for a maximum of one year, or until the condition is corrected, whichever comes first. Chiropractic care. Your PCP will give you a referral to a Fallon Select Care network chiropractor which may cover up to 12 visits, if medically necessary. Physical, occupational and speech therapy. Your PCP will provide you with a written order to take to a Fallon Select Care physical, occupational or speech therapist. For physical and occupational therapy, the written order covers medically necessary services up to your benefit maximum. \n# \nFor certain types of specialist visits and for certain specialty services, your PCP or specialist will need to obtain authorization from the plan before giving you a referral. An authorization is an assurance by the plan to pay for medically necessary covered services provided by a Fallon Select Care network provider to an eligible plan member. \nWhen a service requires authorization, your PCP or specialist will send a request for services to the plan. We will review the request and make an authorization decision within two business days of receipt of all the necessary information. For the purposes of this section, “necessary information” may include the results of any face-to-face clinical evaluation or second opinion that may be required. We will inform your PCP of our decision within 24 hours of the time that we make the decision. If we authorize the service, we will send you and your PCP an authorization letter within two business days thereafter. When you get the letter, you can call a plan specialist to make the appointment. If you do not get an authorization letter, you will be responsible for paying for the services. \nThe authorization letter will state the services the plan has approved for coverage. Make sure that you have this authorization letter before any services requiring authorization are furnished to you. If the specialist feels you need services beyond those authorized, the specialist will ask for authorization directly from the plan. If we approve the request for additional services, we will send both you and your PCP an authorization letter. \nIf we do not authorize a service, we will send you and your PCP a denial letter within one business day of the decision. The denial letter will explain our reasons for the decision and your right to file an appeal. (For information on filing an appeal, see Inquiries, appeals and grievances.) Pending the outcome of the appeal process, in certain circumstances, such as for immediate or urgently needed services, the plan will provide for an automatic reversal of a denial of coverage for services or durable medical equipment, within 48 hours, or sooner for durable medical equipment, if your PCP tells us that in his or her opinion the provision of such service or durable medical equipment should not await the outcome of the normal appeal process and that the service or durable medical equipment is medically necessary and that immediate and severe harm will result if you do not receive the service within 48 hours or sooner for durable medical equipment."

They use national, evidence-based criteria that are reviewed annually by a committee of health plan and community-based physicians to determine the medical appropriateness of selected services requested by your physician. These criteria are approved as being consistent with generally accepted standards of medical practice, including prudent layperson standards for emergency room care. \nFallon also develops in-house criteria, making use of local specialist input and current medical literature, as well as guidelines from Medicare and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \no obtain information about the status or outcome of a utilization review decision, call Fallon at -866-344-4GIC, ext. 69915 (TRS 711). \nThe plan does not provide compensation or other financial incentive or reward to its in-plan providers or staff who conduct utilization management review that is based on the quantity or type of denial decisions rendered. \n# \nFallon’s Quality Services Program systematically measures, monitors, evaluates and improves the performance of the managed care organization with respect to clinical care and service received by its members. Components of the program include careful attention to credentialing and recredentialing of plan providers, evaluation of all member complaints related to quality of care, and a formal peer review program to identify opportunities for improved care (on both an individual-practitioner level and a system-wide level). The plan also conducts focused performance projects related to plan-specific opportunities and formal chronic disease management programs appropriate to the plan’s membership. With respect to service quality, the plan monitors and assures appropriate access to its contracted practitioners as well as complaints related to quality of service. A team of physicians, licensed registered nurses, and specialists create and regularly update clinical guidelines that are then shared with our contracted practitioners to promote preferred medical practices and to improve the quality of care. These guidelines are designed to complement rather than replace your doctor’s clinical judgment. \n# \nFallon maintains a formal mechanism for evaluation of new medical and behavioral health technologies, the new application of existing technologies, and the review of special cases, through our Technology Assessment Committee. The committee includes physician administrators, practicing physicians from the plan’s service area, and plan staff who perform extensive literature review regarding the proposed technology, including review of information from governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and published scientific evidence. We make use of external research organizations, which perform reviews of all available literature regarding a given procedure. When necessary, the committee seeks input from specialists or professionals who have expertise in the proposed technology. \nThe committee recommends for health plan coverage and develops written technology assessment criteria in accordance with standards developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for those technologies that can offer improved outcomes to our members without substantially increasing the risks of treatment. Criteria are reviewed at least biennially or more often as new treatments, applications and technologies are adopted as generally accepted practice. \nFallon has a separate but similar process for evaluation of new drugs and medications, with reviews performed by our Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee."

We will put an oral appeal made by you or your authorized representative in writing and send the written statement to you or your authorized representative within 48 hours of the time that we talked to you, unless you and the plan both agree in writing to waive or extend this time period. \nWe will complete our review and send you a written response within 30 calendar days from the date that we receive your request. If the appeal followed from an unresolved inquiry, the 30-day period will start three business days from the date Fallon received the inquiry or on the day you advise us that you are not satisfied with the results of your inquiry, whichever comes first. These time limits may be waived or extended if you and the plan both agree in writing to the change. This agreement must note the length of the extension, which can be up to 30 days from the date of the agreement. \nYou have the right to provide any additional information, including evidence and allegations of fact or law, in support or your appeal. This may be done in person or in writing. Any new information received by Fallon during the course of the appeal may be sent to you for review. At any point before or during the appeal process, you may examine your case file, which may include medical records or any other documentation and records considered during the appeals process. \nIn some cases, Fallon will need medical records to complete our review of your appeal. If we do, we may ask you to sign a form to authorize your provider to release the records to us. If you do not send this form within 30 calendar days from receipt of your appeal, Fallon will complete the review based on the information that we do have, without the medical records. \nYour appeal will be reviewed by individuals who are knowledgeable about the matters at issue in the appeal. If your appeal is about an adverse determination, the reviewer will be an individual who did not participate in any of the plan’s prior decisions on the issue. The reviewer will consult with a health care professional who is actively practicing in the same or similar specialty that is the subject of your appeal. \nIf the subject matter of the internal review involves the termination of ongoing services, the disputed coverage or treatment shall remain in effect at our expense through completion of the internal appeal process regardless of the final appeal decision. The appeal must be filed on a timely basis, based on the course of treatment. This includes only that medical care that, at the time it was initiated, was authorized by Fallon. It does not include medical care that was terminated due to a specific exclusion in your benefits."

In this case, Fallon would agree in writing to a new time period for review. This would not be longer than 30 days from the date Fallon agrees to the reconsideration. \n# \nYou can request an expedited (fast) review either orally or in writing concerning coverage for immediate and urgently needed services. \n1. Inpatient admission: During your inpatient admission and prior to discharge, a written decision will be provided to you. If the expedited review results in a denial of coverage regarding the continuation of inpatient care, you will have the opportunity to request an expedited external review and the opportunity to request continuation of services through the external review process available through the Office of Patient Protection (OPP). \n2. Immediate and urgent services: You will receive a written determination within 48 hours, if your treating physician certifies that the treatment or proposed treatment is: a. Medically necessary; b. A denial of coverage for the services would create a substantial risk of serious harm to you; and c. Such risk of serious harm is so immediate that the services should not await the outcome of the standard appeal process. \nIf the expedited review process results in an adverse determination, you will be informed of the opportunity to request an expedited external review through the Office of Patient Protection. If your review involves the termination of ongoing services, you will be notified about the opportunity to request continuation of services. \n3.

This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with the Fallon Select Care plan and your options under Medicare’s prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining a non-GIC plan, you should compare your current coverage – particularly which drugs are covered, and at what cost – with that of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage can be found at the end of this notice. \n# \n# \n1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available to everyone with Medicare in 2006. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium. \n2. The GIC has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by your plan is, on average for all participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare Part D drug plan. \n# \nou can join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each subsequent ear from October $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ to December $7^{\\mathtt{t h}}$ . \nHowever, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan. \n# \nIf you enroll in another Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with or without prescription drug coverage, you will be disenrolled from the GIC-sponsored Select Care plan. If you are disenrolled from the Select Care plan, you will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage. If you are the insured and decide to join a non-GIC Medicare drug plan, both you and your covered spouse/dependents will lose your GIC medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health coverage.

If a former spouse has been covered prior to the subscriber’s marriage, the former spouse may, if the divorce judgment so permits, continue coverage under an individual policy with a separate premium for that policy.  Coverage ends if the former spouse remarries or moves out of the Fallon service area.   \nx Birth or adoption of a child. The subscriber may change to family coverage, or add any additional dependents to family coverage at this time. Coverage will be retroactive to the newborn’s date of birth. (See Changing your coverage.)   \nx Loss of other health insurance coverage by a spouse and/or child(ren) who are not currently covered under the subscriber’s contract. The subscriber may add only those dependents who have lost their other coverage.

        "text": "# \nOn January 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented in Massachusetts and across the nation. The ACA brought many benefits to Massachusetts and its residents, helping us expand coverage to more Massachusetts residents, making it more affordable for small businesses to offer their employees healthcare, and providing additional tools to help families, individuals and businesses find affordable coverage.  This notice is meant to help you understand health insurance Marketplaces, which are required by the ACA to make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the state Marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector.  While you may or may not qualify for health insurance through the Health Connector, it may still be helpful for you to read and understand the information included here. \nOverview: There is an easy way for many individuals and small businesses in Massachusetts to buy health insurance: the Massachusetts Health Connector. This notice provides some basic information about the Health Connector, and how coverage available through the Health Connector relates to any coverage that may be offered by your employer.  You can find out more by visiting: MAhealthconnector.org, or for nonMassachusetts residents, Healthcare.gov or (1-800-318-2596; TTY: 1-855-889-4325). \nWhat is the Massachusetts Health Connector? The Health Connector is our state’s health insurance Marketplace. It is designed to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health insurance that meets their needs and fits their budget. The Health Connector offers \"one-stop shopping\" to easily find and compare private health insurance options from the state’s leading health and dental insurance companies. Some individuals and families may also qualify for a new kind of tax credit that lowers their monthly premium right away, as well as cost sharing reductions that can lower out-of-pocket expenses.  This new tax credit is enabled by $\\S26\\mathsf{B}$ of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code. \nOpen enrollment for individuals and families to buy health insurance coverage through the Health Connector occurs every year.  You can find out more by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 1-877-MA ENROLL (1-877-623-6765). \n# \nDepending on your income, you may qualify for federal and/or state tax credits and other subsidies that reduce your premiums and lower your out-of-pocket expenses if you shop through the Health Connector.  You can find out more about the income criteria for qualifying for these subsidies by visiting MAhealthconnector.org or calling 1-877-MA ENROLL (1-877-623-6765). \n# \nAn offer of health coverage from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as the employer, could affect your eligibility for these credits and subsidies through the Health Connector.  If your income meets the eligibility criteria, you will qualify for credits and subsidies through the Health Connector if: \nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not offer coverage to you, or"

Visit www.mass.gov/gic or see your GIC Coordinator for more information. Temporary employees, contractors, less-than-half time part time workers, and most seasonal employees are not eligible for GIC health insurance benefits.

In any case of misrepresentation, the health plan may deny enrollment to you in the future. Your premium charge is not paid within the grace period appropriate for your health plan. (See How your coverage works for information about grace periods and nonpayment of premium.) The plan will notify you of the effective date of the cancellation, in accordance with Massachusetts insurance regulations. You commit an act of physical or verbal abuse that poses a threat to a plan provider, a plan employee or another plan member. In such an instance, we must determine that the act of abuse was not related to your physical or mental condition. The GIC cancels its group service agreement with Fallon. In the event that your group coverage is canceled because the GIC fails to pay the premium charge to us, you may apply for short-term (60-day) conversion coverage. To apply for this coverage, send us a written request within 60 days of the day you receive our notice of the group’s cancellation. The 60-day conversion coverage will be available at the same cost and coverage level as you previously had under your group coverage. At the end of your 60-day conversion coverage, if you would like to remain a Fallon Health member, you can join a consumer plan. (See Changing to a consumer plan for more information.)

        "text": "# \n# \n# \nThis notice explains your COBRA rights and what you need to do to protect your right to receive it. You will receive a COBRA notice and application if the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) is informed that your current GIC coverage is ending due either to (1) end of employment, (2) reduction in hours of employment; (3) death of employee/retiree; (4) divorce or legal separation; or (5) loss of dependent child status.  This COBRA notice contains important information about your right to temporarily continue your health care coverage in the Group Insurance Commission’s (GIC’s) health plan through a federal law known as COBRA.  If you elect to continue your coverage, COBRA coverage will begin on the first day of the month immediately after your current GIC coverage ends. \nYou must complete the GIC COBRA Election Form and return it to the GIC by no later than 60 days after your group coverage ends by sending it by mail to the Public Information Unit at the GIC at P.O. Box 8747, Boston, MA 02114 or by hand delivery to the GIC, 19 Staniford Street, $4^{\\mathrm{th}}$ floor, Boston, MA 02114.  If you do not submit a completed election form by this deadline, you will lose your right to elect COBRA coverage. \nWHAT IS COBRA COVERAGE?  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) is a federal law under which certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses and dependent children have the right to temporarily continue their existing group health coverage at group rates when group coverage otherwise would end due to certain life events, called ‘Qualifying Events.’ If you elect COBRA coverage, you are entitled to the same coverage being provided under the GIC’s plan to similarly situated employees or dependents. The GIC administers COBRA coverage. \nWHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR COBRA COVERAGE?  Each individual entitled to COBRA (known as a “Qualified Beneficiary”) has an independent right to elect the coverage, regardless of whether or not other eligible family members elect it. Qualified Beneficiaries may elect to continue their group coverage that otherwise would end due to the following life events: \nIf you are an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or municipality covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage if \nx You lose your group health coverage because your hours of employment are reduced; or Your employment ends for reasons other than gross misconduct. \nIf you are the spouse of an employee covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, you have the right to choose COBRA coverage for yourself if you lose GIC health coverage for any of the following reasons (known as “qualifying events”): \nx Your spouse dies; Your spouse’s employment with the Commonwealth or participating municipality ends for any reason other than gross misconduct or his/her hours of employment are reduced; or   \nYou and your spouse legally separate or divorce."

        "text": "If you have dependent children who are covered by the GIC’s health benefits program, each child has the right to elect COBRA coverage if he or she loses GIC health coverage for any of the following reasons (known as “qualifying events”): \nx The employee-parent dies;   \nx The employee-parent’s employment is terminated (for reasons other than gross misconduct) or the parent’s hours or employment are reduced;   \nx The parents legally separate or divorce; or   \nx The dependent ceases to be a dependent child under GIC eligibility rules \nHOW LONG DOES COBRA COVERAGE LAST?  By law, COBRA coverage must begin on the day immediately after your group health coverage otherwise would end.  If your group coverage ends due to employment termination or reduction in employment hours, COBRA coverage may last for up to 18 months.  If it ends due to any other qualifying events listed above, you may maintain COBRA coverage for up to 36 months. \nIf you have COBRA coverage due to employment termination or reduction in hours, your family members’ COBRA coverage may be extended beyond the initial 18-month period up to a total of 36 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if a second qualifying event – the insured’s death or divorce - occurs during the 18 months of COBRA coverage.  You must notify the GIC in writing within 60 days of the second qualifying event and before the 18-month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage. Your COBRA coverage may be extended to a total of 29 months (as measured from the initial qualifying event) if any qualified beneficiary in your family receiving COBRA coverage is disabled during the first 60 days of your 18-month COBRA coverage.  You must provide the GIC with a copy of the Social Security Administration’s disability determination within 60 days after you receive it and before your initial 18 month COBRA period ends in order to extend the coverage. \nCOBRA coverage will end before the maximum coverage period ends if any of the following occurs: \nx The COBRA cost is not paid in full when due (see section on paying for COBRA); You or another qualified beneficiary become covered under another group health plan that does not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion for the qualified beneficiary’s pre-existing covered condition covered by COBRA benefits; You are no longer disabled as determined by the Social Security Administration (if your COBRA coverage was extended to 29 months due to disability); The Commonwealth of Massachusetts or your municipal employer no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees; or   \nAny reason for which the GIC terminates a non-COBRA enrollee’s coverage (such as fraud). \nThe GIC will notify you in writing if your COBRA coverage is to be terminated before the maximum coverage period ends.  The GIC reserves the right to terminate your COBRA coverage retroactively if you are subsequently found to have been ineligible for coverage. \nHOW AND WHEN DO I ELECT COBRA COVERAGE?  Qualified beneficiaries must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of the date that their group coverage otherwise would end or within 60 days of receiving a COBRA notice, whichever is later.  A qualified beneficiary may change a prior rejection of COBRA election any time until that date.  If you do not elect COBRA coverage within the 60–day election period, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage."

        "text": "In considering whether to elect COBRA coverage you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law, including the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a spouse’s plan) within 30 days after your GIC coverage ends due to a qualifying event. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of COBRA coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum time available to you. \nHOW MUCH DOES COBRA COVERAGE COST?  Under COBRA, you must pay $102\\%$ of the applicable cost of your COBRA coverage.  If your COBRA coverage is extended to 29 months due to disability, your cost will increase to $150\\%$ of the applicable full cost rate for the additional 11 months of coverage.  COBRA costs will change periodically; current COBRA rates are included with this notice. \nHOW AND WHEN DO I PAY FOR COBRA COVERAGE?  If you elect COBRA coverage, you must make your first payment for COBRA coverage within 45 days after the date you elect it.  If you do not make your first payment for COBRA coverage within the 45-day period, you will lose all COBRA coverage rights under the plan. \nYour first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time your coverage would have ended up to the time you make the first payment.  Services cannot be covered until the GIC receives and processes this first payment, and you are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is enough to cover this entire period.  After you make your first payment, you will be required to pay for COBRA coverage for each subsequent month of coverage.  These periodic payments are due usually around the $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of each month.  The GIC will send monthly bills, specifying the due date for payment and the address to which payment is to be sent for COBRA coverage, but you are responsible for paying for the coverage even if you do not receive a monthly statement.  Payments should be sent to the GIC’s address on the bill. \nAfter the first payment, you will have a 30-day grace period beyond the due date on each monthly bill in which to make your monthly payment.  Your COBRA coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment.  If you fail to make a periodic payment before the end of the grace period for that payment, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage. \nCAN I ELECT OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE BESIDES COBRA?  Yes.  You have the right to enroll, within 31 days after coverage ends, in an individual health insurance ‘conversion’ policy with your current health plan without providing proof of insurability. Alternately, if you are a Massachusetts resident, you may purchase health insurance through the Commonwealth’s Health Connector Authority, or for employees in other states, through a Health Insurance Marketplace where available. The GIC has no involvement in conversion programs, and only very limited involvement in Health Connector programs.  You pay the premium to the plan sponsor for the coverage. The benefits provided under such a policy might not be identical to those provided through COBRA.  You may exercise this right in lieu of electing COBRA coverage, or you may exercise this right after you have received the maximum COBRA coverage available to you."

Contact your plan sponsor to find out if you qualify. If you do, you may continue group health coverage during your leave, but you must continue to pay the portion of the premium that you would pay if you were actively working. Your coverage will be subject to suspension or cancellation if you fail to pay your premium on time. (See How your coverage works.) If you take a leave and group coverage is cancelled for any reason during your leave, you may resume coverage when you return to work without waiting for an open enrollment period. \n# \nIf your eligibility for health insurance coverage through the GIC ends, you may be eligible to join a consumer plan. Contact Fallon at 1-888-797-3247 to find out more about the options available to you. You may not convert to a consumer plan if your group coverage ended because of fraud on your part."

A service is covered according to the terms and conditions described in this Member Handbook/Evidence of Coverage only if it is medically necessary, provided by your PCP or another plan provider (except in emergency situations), and in some cases, authorized by the plan. The following section describes your costs for the benefits that you use. \n# \nYou are responsible for a maximum of one inpatient copayment per member in each calendar year quarter, and four outpatient surgery copayments per member in each calendar year. (Note that if you are re-admitted within a 30-day period, we will waive the second copayment.) \nFallon will track the copayments that apply to the calendar year limit. When you reach the maximum for any service, we will send you a letter that indicates the date of the last required copayment for that service. For the rest of the calendar year, you may present a copy of the letter to the cashier who will not take a copayment for the specified services. If you do not bring the letter with you to the appointment, you may be asked to pay the copayment. \nIf you pay any copayments that you are not responsible for, you may send a letter to the Claims Manager at Fallon requesting reimbursement of those copayments. Include your name, address, membership number, proof of payment (encounter form, receipt, check, etc.) and an address to which the reimbursement should be sent. You must file a claim within two years of the date of service. \n# \nCoinsurance is your share of the allowed charge for certain covered benefits, usually expressed as a percentage.

When you have an emergency medical condition, you should go to the nearest emergency room for care or call your local emergency communications system (e.g., police or fire department, or 911). \nAn emergency medical condition is a condition, whether physical or mental, manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, with an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of prompt medical attention to result in: \n1. serious jeopardy to the health of the member or another person (or unborn child),   \n2. serious impairment to bodily functions, or   \n3. serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. \nExamples of covered emergencies include, but are not limited to, stroke, unconsciousness, heart attack symptoms or severe bleeding. \nEmergency services do not require referral or prior authorization, but you must notify the plan of any emergency services that you receive. Your PCP should be notified so that arrangements can be made for any follow-up or continuing care that is medically necessary for you. You should be aware that follow-up care in an emergency room often will not meet a prudent layperson definition and that most emergency room follow-up care can be provided in a setting other than an emergency room. \nEmergency services will be covered from all providers at the cost level of the lowest cost-sharing tier regardless of the tier in which the health benefit plan has classified the provider providing such emergency services within the Tiered Provider Network including for inpatient deductibles if the insured seeking or receiving emergency services is subsequently admitted. \n# \nSometimes you may need care right away for minor emergencies such as cuts that require stitches, a sprained ankle or abdominal pain. These situations may not pose as much of a threat as the emergency situations discussed above, but they still require fast treatment to prevent serious deterioration of your health. \nIf you are within the Select Care service area, call your PCP’s office for information on how and where to seek treatment. If your doctor is not available, an on-call doctor will make arrangements for your care. Telephones are answered 24 hours a day seven days a week. Explain the medical situation to the doctor and state where you are calling from, so that the doctor can refer you to the most appropriate facility. You may also call the Reliant Medical Group Urgent Care Department directly for an appointment for urgent care services if you have a Reliant Medical Group PCP. \nIf you are outside the Select Care service area, go to the nearest medical facility for care. If you need followup care, you should contact your PCP for assistance. \n# \n1. Emergency room visits   \n2. Emergency room visits when you are admitted to an observation room   \n3.

(Please note that there are some medications that cannot be mailed and are not available through the mail-order program.) See your Select Care Provider Network directory for a list of plan pharmacies. \n# \nThe Fallon formulary is a list of medications that shows the applicable cost-sharing tier and prior authorization requirements for each medication. We have selected the tiers and determined the criteria for prior authorization based on efficacy and cost-effectiveness. \nThe Fallon prescription drug formulary has a multi-tiered cost-sharing structure. We have selected the tiers based on efficacy and cost-effectiveness. There is a different cost-sharing for each tier. \nCoverage of certain drugs is based on medical necessity. For these drugs, you will need prior authorization from the plan. They are noted on the formulary as “PA.” Your doctor should request authorization from Fallon, and give us the clinical information that we need to make our decision, before he or she writes the prescription. We will review the authorization request according to our criteria for medical necessity. \nThe prescription drug formulary is available at our website at fallonhealth.org/gic. If you do not have access to our website or if you have any questions about the formulary please call Customer Service. \nThe Fallon formulary may include drugs used for the formulary treatment of cancer or HIV/AIDS, in accordance with state law. \n# \nPrescription drugs are generally dispensed for up to a 30-day supply. The corresponding cost-sharing, as noted in your Schedule of Benefits, will be charged for up to a 30-day supply. In some instances, the plan has established dispensing limitations, which may include a quantity limit on certain medications. For maintenance medication you may obtain up to a 90-day supply. We follow FDA, state and federal dispensing guidelines. You generally cannot obtain a refill until most or all of the previous supply has been used. \nPlease note: Your doctor may prescribe medication in a dose that is not available through the purchase of a single prescription. In these cases, you may need to fill more than one prescription—and pay the corresponding cost-sharing, as noted in your Schedule of Benefits, each—to achieve the desired dose. \n# \nA generic drug is a drug product that meets the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is equivalent to a brand-name product in terms of quality and performance. It may differ in certain other characteristics (e.g., shape, flavor or preservatives). By law, generic drug products must contain identical amounts of the same active drug ingredient as the brand-name product. \nA generic preferred program is now in place. This means if you fill a prescription with a brand-name drug when a generic is available, you will be responsible for the drug copayment plus the cost difference between the two drugs."

You may have your prescription mailed directly to you at home or at any other location if you are traveling within the country. Most medications can be mailed; however, there are some that may not. (Medications cannot be mailed to other countries.) \nWhen you fill your prescription through our mail-order program you may order up to a 90-day supply of most medications. The Tier-1 and Tier-2 mail-order copayment amount is equal to the cost of two retail pharmacy copayments (that is, the amount you would pay for a 60-day supply at a retail pharmacy). The Tier-3 mailorder copayment amount is equal to the cost of two-and-one-quarter retail pharmacy copayments. \n# \nIf you are a new member and need to have an existing prescription refilled, we encourage you to see your PCP to review your prescriptions.
