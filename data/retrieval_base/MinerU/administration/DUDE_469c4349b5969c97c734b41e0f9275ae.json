        "text": "# \nThe zoning map amendments to Zoning Sectional Maps 16c and 16d described in these pages (ULURP number C 030194(A) ZMK) were approved by the City Planning Commission on April 2, 2003 and adopted by the City Council on April 30, 2003. \n# \nThe Department of City Planning proposes a zoning map amendment to rezone 110 blocks in Park Slope, Brooklyn in Community District 6. The goals of the rezoning are to preserve the historic scale of the brownstone neighborhoods, and provide increased opportunities for residential and commercial development on Fourth Avenue. \nThe rezoning area is generally bounded by Union Street to the north, 15th Street to the south, Prospect Park West to the east, and Third and Fourth Avenues to the west. A section of Fourth Avenue between President and Warren Streets is also included in the rezoning area. In 1993, the northern portion of Park Slope between Flatbush Avenue, Fourth Avenue and Union Street was rezoned to contextual districts; this rezoning would extend these districts south to 15th Street. \nThe proposed rezoning would replace the existing R6 district with R6B and R7B contextual designations in midblock areas and avenues where rowhouses predominate, with R6A along Third, Fifth, and Seventh Avenues and a portion of 9th Street, and with R7A on Prospect Park West. Along Fourth Avenue, the proposal would replace the R6 district south of Union Street and the R7A district north of Union Street with R8A. The rezoning would replace C1-3 and C2-3 commercial overlays with C1-4 and C2-4 overlays, and would establish additional commercial overlays to reflect existing land use. The proposal also includes changing a C4-3 district on Fifth Avenue to C4-3A, a portion of Fourth Avenue's M1-2 district to C8-2, and an area of M1-2 to R6B. \n# \n\n#"

        "text": "# \nPark Slope is one of Brooklyn's most prized brownstone neighborhoods. It is predominantly residential, characterized by late 19th and early 20th century rowhouses with architectural significance. The neighborhood is home to one of the earliest and largest historic districts in the city. The Park Slope Historic District was established in 1973 and comprises 44 blocks both within the rezoning area and to the north. Approximately 20 percent of the rezoning area is within the Historic District. \n\n4th Street between Eighth Avenue and Prospect Park West \n\n8th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues \nThe rezoning area is currently zoned almost entirely R6 (shown in yellow), with a small area of R7A to the north on Fourth Avenue and R8B on Bartel Pritchard Square in the southeast corner of the study area. R6 is a non-contextual, mediumdensity residential district with a maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 2.43. The contextual R7A and R8B zoning districts with FARs of 4.0 and height limits of 80' and 75', respectively, were both mapped in the early 1990's. \nSince the mid-1980s, developers in residential neighborhoods have had the option of using a contextual building form if their buildings provided certain amenities. These alternate regulations (called the Quality Housing Program) permit a maximum FAR of 2.2 and building height of 55' on narrow streets in R6 districts, and, on wide streets, a maximum FAR of 3.0 and a maximum building height of 70'. This building on 2nd Street is an example of recent construction that used the optional contextual regulations. \n# \n\n# \n\n\n2nd Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues \nFifth Avenue and Seventh Avenue are the main neighborhood commercial corridors. C1-3 and C2-3 commercial overlays and a C4-3 commercial district are consistent with existing uses. Buildings on these streets are four to six stories tall with ground floor commercial uses and residential apartments on the upper floors. Some neighborhood commercial uses are located in the southern part of Eighth Avenue within a C1-3 commercial overlay, and a few preexisting nonconforming shops are on the northern side of Ninth Street and on the northwestern corner of Bartel Pritchard Square."

There are numerous underbuilt and underutilized former warehouse sites, particularly along Fourth Avenue. \nThe rezoning area includes a portion of the M1-2 manufacturing district on the western side of Fourth Avenue between 3rd and 7th Streets. This area is dominated by large-scale commercial uses, with auto-repair and community facility uses intermixed. \n\nFourth Avenue looking north from 6th Street \nThe other M1-2 district in the study area, to the southwest between Third and Fourth Avenues and 14th and 15th Streets, contains only five lots with a total of 20,000 square feet. This district is surrounded by an R6 residential zoning district and residential uses. The lots are currently in mixed residential and warehouse use."

        "text": "# \nR6B and R7B zoning designations are proposed for over $70\\%$ of the rezoning area. \nIn the neighborhood's midblocks and on wide streets where four-story rowhouses predominate (Sixth and Eighth Avenues, 3rd Street and the eastern portion of 9th Street) R6B zoning would protect the historic character and scale. The R6B district allows a maximum FAR of 2.0 for all permitted uses, and limits overall building heights to 50 feet and streetwall base heights to 40 feet. \nR6B is proposed for the existing M1-2 district between Third and Fourth Avenues and 14th and 15th Streets, consistent with the surrounding zoning and character. \nTypical R6B Developments - These buildings were developed using the bulk regulations for Quality Housing on a narrow street, which are comparable to R6B regulations. \n\n\n2nd Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues \n1st Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues \nThe midblocks between Prospect Park West, Union Street, Carroll Street and Eighth Avenue, where higher-density, fivestory rowhouses predominate, are proposed to be rezoned from R6 to R7B. R7B allows a maximum FAR of 3.0 for all permitted uses, and has a building height limit of 75 feet and a maximum base height of 60 feet. \nR6A and C4-3A - Third, Fifth and Seventh Avenues and 9th Street between Third and Sixth Aves \nBuildings on these streets are generally a little taller than in the midblocks – between four to six stories with ground floor commercial use and residential upper stories. Although the existing built environment along Third Avenue is lower scale, R6A is also an appropriate scale for redevelopment consistent with other mixed commercial and residential streets in the neighborhood. \n6A allows a maximum FAR of 3.0 for residential, mixed residential/commercial, and community facility buildings, with maximum building height of 70 feet and a maximum base height of 60 feet. \nTypical R6A Developments - These buildings were developed using the bulk regulations for Quality Housing on a wide street, which are comparable to R6A regulations. \nFifth Avenue and 2nd Street \nNew York Methodist Hospital Seventh Avenue and 6th Street \nThe C4-3A commercial district proposed for Fifth Avenue between 8th and 15th Streets has the same bulk and density regulations as R6A. Second story commercial uses are permitted in the C4-3A district in mixed residential/commercial buildings, whereas they are prohibited in mixed-use buildings in the R6A/C2-4 district proposed north of 8th Street. \nThe existing C4-3 district in this section of Fifth Avenue is mapped 200 feet deep on the west and 150 feet deep on the east to accommodate large department stores and parking. The proposed C4-3A district would generally be mapped to a 100-foot depth consistent with existing land use. \n# \nProspect Park West between 1st and 14th Streets would be rezoned from R6 to R7A. This street contains a mix of rowhouses and mid-rise apartment houses facing Prospect Park. R7A permits a maximum FAR of 4.0 for all permitted uses, with a maximum building height of 80 feet and a maximum base height of 65 feet. \n#"

        "text": "Fourth Avenue can accommodate increased housing and commercial development. It is an extremely wide street (120') with excellent transit access. The M, N and R subway lines have stations along Fourth Avenue at Union and 9th Streets and at Prospect Avenue, and an F-line station is at Fourth Avenue and 9th Street. This street can support greater density than the 3.0 FAR permitted under Quality Housing in the R6 district. Currently, there are a number of underutilized and vacant sites on Fourth Avenue. \nAlong Fourth Avenue, the proposed zoning map amendments would replace the R7A district between Warren and Union Streets and the R6 district between Union and 15th Streets with an R8A designation to promote apartment house construction. R8A districts have a maximum FAR of 6.5 for community facility uses and a maximum FAR of 6.02 for residential and mixed residential/commercial uses. R8A districts have a maximum building height of 120 feet and a maximum base height of 85 feet. \nTypical R8A Developments - \n\n\nTenth Avenue between 54th and 55th Street, Manhattan \nproposed R8A building, Court Street and Atlantic Avenue (Beyer Blinder Belle Architects & Planners LLP) \nThe Fourth Avenue Site Analysis shows how the proposed zoning change would affect future development. \nThe blocks bounded by Third and Fourth Avenues and 3rd and 7th Streets contain predominantly auto-oriented commercial uses and no manufacturing uses. This area is proposed to be rezoned from M1-2 to C8-2 to better reflect the existing land uses and provide an opportunity for a broader range of commercial activities at this location. The permitted FAR would remain the same at 2.0. No residential or community facility uses with sleeping accommodations are permitted in either M1-2 or C8-2 districts. \n# \nCommercial overlays are proposed where ground floor retail uses already predominate, including on Third, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Avenues, a few blocks on Eighth Avenue in the southern part of the rezoning area, the northwestern corner of Bartel Pritchard Square, and the northern side of 9th Street between Fourth and Sixth Avenues. \nCommercial overlays on the eastern side of Fourth Avenue and on Fifth Avenue are currently mapped 150 feet deep to allow for parking. Since most commercial uses do not extend beyond 100 feet from the avenues, the overlays would be narrowed to a depth of 100 feet. \nAll existing C1-3 and C2-3 commercial overlays would be replaced with C1-4 and C2-4 overlays to reduce the parking requirements for most commercial uses from one parking space for every 400 square feet of commercial space to one per 1,000 square feet. \n# \nThe campus of New York Methodist Hospital is located near the center of the rezoning area. The campus would remain in an R6 district, since the hospital has developed most of its property pursuant to existing regulations for community facility uses (4.8 FAR in an R6 district) and may need the greater flexibility of the existing R6 zone in order to make necessary improvements in the future. \nContact the Brooklyn Office at (718) 780-8280 with any questions."
