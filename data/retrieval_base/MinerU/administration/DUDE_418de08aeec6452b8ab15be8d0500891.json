        "text": "Chapter1 \n# \nA National Garden Conference called by Claude R.Wickard,Secretary of Agriculture, andPaulV.MNutt,DirectoroftheOfficeofDefense,Healthand Welfare Services,metin Washington,D.C.,in December 1941.The large attendance and diligent committee work showed plainly that there was a wide interest in gardening as a wartime activity.The delegates attending the Conference represented garden associations and clubs,the garden press, seed,horticultural and allied trade associations andpapers,thefarmpressradio stations, the United States Department of Agriculture，the Federal Security Agency， the Office of Civilian Defense,the WorkProjects Administration,nationalyouth organizations,and other agencies.Discussion by the delegates revealed that there are already extensive farm home, community and school garden programs being carried on throughout the country by Government agencies,and that these programswill be expanded. \nIt was also apparent that there would be some expansion of home gardens.The conference agreed thatdueto thedesirabilityofconservingseed,fertilizer,andspraymaterial as well as the avoidance of disappointing results,home vegetable gardens should be confined to farms,small-andmedium-sized towns,and suburban areas.It is recognized that while city gardening has health,recreational,and morale values,city back yards are seldom successful in the production of vegetables as the soil is usually poor and other conditions unfavorable.Therefore,it is desirable to continue the landscape improvement of city yards andnottodestroy lawns and ornamental plantingsfor the sake ofafewvegetables. \nChapter Il \n# \nTheVictory GardenProgram will: \n1.Increase the production and consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits bymore and better home,school,and community gardens,to the end that we become a stronger and healthierNation.   \n2.Encourage the proper storage and preservation of the surplus from such gardensfor distribution and use by families producing it,local school lunches,welfare agencies, andforlocalemergencyfoodneeds.   \n3.Enable families and institutionsto save on the cost ofvegetables and apply this saving to other necessary foodswhich must be purchased.   \n4.Providethroughthemediumofcommunitygardensanopportunityforgardeningby urban dwellers and others who lack suitablehome garden facilities.   \n5.Maintain and improve the morale and spiritual well-being of the individual,family， andNation. \nThe beautificationof the home and communityby gardening provides healthful physical exercise,recreation,definite release from war stress and strain."
