The CQA ENGINEER is responsible for certifying that the materials and construction were in accordance with the Closure Drawings and this CQA Plan. \n# \nDuring construction, conformance and performance testing of the subgrade soil materials will be performed by the CQC ENGINEER. The CQC ENGINEER will monitor and document proof rolling of areas that are to receive structural fill. Areas of proof rolling or compacted fill that do not conform to this CQA Plan will be delineated and reported to the Contractor. The CQC ENGINEER will document that these areas are reworked by the Contractor and retested until passing results are achieved. \nThe CQA ENGINEER will monitor and document if the subgrade is damaged by excess moisture (causing softening), insufficient moisture (causing desiccation and shrinkage), or by freezing. When such conditions exist, the CQA ENGINEER will evaluate the suitability of the subgrade by one or more of the following methods: \n1. Moisture / density testing;   \n2. Continuous visual inspection during proof rolling; or   \n3. Other test methods identified herein. \nThe CQA ENGINEER will inform the Contractor of the results and will document when the Contractor repairs areas damaged as indicated above. The CQA ENGINEER will retest the repaired areas until passing results are achieved. \n# \nThe CQC ENGINEER will observe and test the structural fill to ensure uniformity and conformity to the requirements of this CQA Plan. For fill materials obtained from approved borrow areas, visual inspections and conformance tests will be performed by the CQC ENGINEER prior to the materials being used. \nStructural earth fill should generally consist of sandy clays (CL), clayey silts (ML), clayey sands (SC), and clayey to silty sands (SC/SM). Unsuitable soils for the general fill are classified as organics, peat, highly plastic clays, and soils that contain roots, logs, wood, or any decomposable materials. \nThe structural fill will not contain any roots (or other organic matter), clay clods, rocks greater than 3 inches in largest dimension, or any other deleterious debris."

Structural fill materials will be placed in uniform layers of eight inches, nominal thickness, loose measurement, for one foot beyond the full width of the fill on each side. The thickness of each layer will be kept uniform with the necessary grading equipment. Upon completion of compaction, the slopes will be cut back to the final slope. Particular care will be used to obtain the required compaction along the edges of the fill slopes. The compacted surface of each lift will provide a proper bonding surface for the succeeding layer. \nPrior to hauling off-site borrow area materials to the project site, priority pollutant testing will be performed on the material. The Contractor will notify the CQC ENGINEER at least three weeks prior to hauling activities so soil samples may be collected for chemical analyses. No off-site borrow materials may be brought onto the site until the analytical results have been reviewed by the CQA ENGINEER and the borrow source approved. \n# \nAll testing will be conducted in accordance with this CQA Plan. The field-testing methods used to evaluate the suitability of soils during their installation will be performed by the CQC ENGINEER in accordance with current ASTM test procedures indicated in Table 1. The CQC ENGINEER will be responsible for documenting and reporting test results. \nSoil testing will be performed to determine soil type (Unified Classification), grain size distribution, moisture content, Atterberg Limits, and moisture-density relationships.  Documentation and reporting of the test results will be the responsibility of the CQC ENGINEER. \nTesting will be conducted during the course of the Work. The minimum construction testing frequencies are presented in Table 1. The frequency may be increased at the discretion of the CQA ENGINEER or if variability of the materials is observed. Sampling locations will be selected by the CQC ENGINEER. The location of routine in-place density tests will be determined using a nonbiased sampling approach. \nA special testing frequency will be used at the discretion of the CQA ENGINEER when visual observations of construction performance indicate a potential problem."

The rolls must be adequate for safe transportation to the point of delivery, offloading and storage.  Storage measures will be taken as specifically stated by the manufacturer in an area specified by GPC. The storage will be free of materials capable of damaging the material. \nThe geocomposite roll will be installed in the direction of the slope and in the intended direction of flow unless otherwise specified by the CQA ENGINEER. In the presence of wind, all geocomposites will be weighted down with sandbags or equivalent.  Such sandbags will be used during placement and remain until replaced with cover material. \nIn applying fill material, no equipment will drive directly across the geocomposite.  The specified fill material will be placed and spread utilizing vehicles with a low ground pressure. The cover soil will be placed on the geocomposite in a manner that prevents damage to the geocomposite. \nEach component of the geocomposite will be secured or seamed to the like component at overlaps.  Adjacent edges of the geonet along the length of the roll will be placed with the edges of each geonet butted against each other.  The overlaps will be joined by tying the geonet structure with plastic cable ties spaced every five (5) feet along the roll length, located at least 3 intact ribs away from the leading edge and be a contrasting color to the geonet material. \nAdjoining geocomposite rolls (end to end) across the roll width should be shingled down in the direction of the slope, with the geonet portion of the top overlapping the geonet portion of the bottom geocomposite a minimum of twelve (12) inches across the roll width, located at least 3 intact ribs away from the leading edge and be a contrasting color to the geonet material. \nThe geonet portion will be tied every six (6) inches in the anchor trench. \nPrior to covering the deployed geocomposite, each roll will be inspected for damage resulting from construction. Any rips, tears or damaged areas on the deployed geocomposite will be removed and patched.  The patch will be secured to the original geonet by tying every six (6) inches with the approved tying devices.  If the area to be repaired is more than 50 percent of the width of the panel, the damaged area will be cut out and the two portions of the geonet will be joined as discussed above."

For fill materials obtained from borrow areas, visual inspections and conformance tests will be performed by the CQC ENGINEER in accordance with the CQA Plan prior to the materials being used. \nProtective soil cover should generally consist of sandy clays (CL), clayey silts (ML), clayey sands (SC), and clayey to silty sands (SC/SM). Unsuitable soils for the general fill are classified as organics, peat, highly plastic clays, and soils that contain roots, logs, wood, or any decomposable materials. \nIt will be necessary for the CQC ENGINEER to observe topsoil to ensure they are uniform and conform to the requirements in the CQA Plan and the Closure Drawings. For fill materials obtained from borrow areas, visual inspections and conformance tests will be performed by the CQC ENGINEER in accordance with the CQA Plan prior to the materials being used. \nCQC personnel will observe soils for deleterious materials (e.g., roots, stumps, rocks, and large objects). The protective soil cover material will be free of angular stones, particles in excess of one inch in maximum diameter, or other foreign matter that could damage the geocomposite and the HDPE geomembrane liner. \nPrior to hauling off-site borrow material to the project site, priority pollutant testing will be performed on the material. The Contractor will notify the CQC Engineer at least three weeks prior to hauling activities so soil samples may be collected for chemical analyses. No off-site borrow materials may be brought onto the site until the analytical results have been reviewed by the CQA ENGINEER and the borrow source approved. \n# \nThe CQC ENGINEER will confirm that the protective soil cover is placed and compacted with a minimum of four (4) complete passes with the tracks of low contact pressure, wide-tracked construction equipment. \n# \nVegetation will be established in accordance with the Closure Plan. If the use of fertilizers is warranted, the Contractor will follow the Fertilizer Requirements in the Closure Plan."
