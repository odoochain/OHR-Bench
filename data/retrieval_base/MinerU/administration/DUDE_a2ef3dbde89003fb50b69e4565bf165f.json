These returns were prepared on the basis of the information put at our disposal. \nPage 8 of the original corporate income tax return and page 1 of the tax credit for investment must be signed by a legal representative of the company. The signed returns must then be sent to the following address: \nAdministration des Contributions Directes Bureau d'imposition - Sociétés V 18, rue du Fort Wedell L-2982 Luxembourg \nIn addition, could you please send us a copy of the tax assessments for the taxable year 2o11 as soon as you receive them, so that we can verify that they match the filed returns? \nPlease note that if it is necessary to file an appeal against the assessments, the latter has to be introduced within the legal term of three months after receipt of the assessments. \nWith respect to these corporate tax returns, we would like to draw your attention on the following items: \n# \nBased on the 2o11 financial statements, the company realized a commercial profit amounting to EUR 63,559,665. This result has to be adjusted by the non deductible tax charges (EUR 26,603,081). Consequently, the taxable basis of the company should amount to EUR 9o,162,746. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers S.a r.l., 400 Route d'Esch, B.P. 1443, L-1014 Luxembourg T: +352 494848 1, F:+352 494848 2900, www.pwc.lu Cabinet de révision agrée.Expert-comptable (autorisation gouvernementale n°o0123693) R.C.S.Luxembourg B 65 477- Capital social EUR 516950-TVA LU17564447"

        "text": "The company should benefit from a tax credit for investment amounting to EUR 13,71o. This tax credit reduces the CIT due for the year. \nThe company should therefore be liable to a CIT of EUR 19,867,165 and a MBT of EUR 6,084,801 for the fiscal year 2011. \nAs mentioned in the 2oio tax file, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that some of the investments could be eligible to a tax credit for investment (i.e. acquisition of hardware) but we had to exclude them as the amortization period was less than three years. Indeed, article 152bis of the Luxembourg Income Tax Law states that all investments made by Luxembourg tax payers in depreciable tangible assets (except in buildings) are eligible to the tax credit provided that they are depreciated over a period of at least three years. As a consequence we would recommend you to reconsider the amortization period of all your investments in hardware in the future to be able to benefit from this tax credit. \nFurthermore, we noted that the depreciation table does not totally match with the note 3 “Fixed assets\" of the annual accounts (e.g. total of the acquisition cost, total of the acquisitions of the year,..). Therefore, please note that the tax administration could request additional information about these differences. \n# \nAs a general rule, the NWT basis is the “unitary value” of the company on 1 January each year. The unitary value is determined by the difference between the assets and the liabilities against third parties. \nAccording to our computation and as confirmed by the tax authorities, the unitary value of the company as of 1 January 2011 should amount to EUR 85,014,00o. Consequently, the company should be liable to a NWT of EUR 425,070 for the year 2011. \nAs for the previous years, we have assumed that you intend to benefit from the NWT reduction for the year 2o11. We remind you that in order to benefit from this reduction, the company has to create a special reserve amounting to five times the NWT due for the year (i.e. EUR 2,125,350 to be created in the 2o12 accounts). Moreover, the company has to keep this special reserve in the accounts during five years following the accounting year of reduction (i.e. until 24 September 2016). \nPlease note that if those conditions are not fulfilled, the NWT will be due to the Luxembourg authorities. \nFor the determination of the unitary value for the year 2012 (based on the accounts as at 24 September 2011), please note that we have not deducted the deferred income of EUR 161,833,999 as we understand that this amount does not constitute liabilities to third parties. We understand it relates to actual sales which are deferred in the income statement of future years (see e-mail of Mrs Maeve Hoey dated 9 May 2012). This should however not change the NWT position of the company, i.e. no NWT should be due for 20121. \n# \nWe would like to inform you that the contribution to the “Chambre de Commerce\" for the year 2013, which is computed on the 2011 CIT basis before tax losses, if any, should amount to EUR 158,163."
