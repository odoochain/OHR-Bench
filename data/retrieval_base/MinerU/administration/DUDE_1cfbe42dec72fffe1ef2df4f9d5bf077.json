In this connection, the CcC established the Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation System (RBMES), which enables efficient monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP), since its formulation in 2011. Moreover, the CCC held several consultations with agencies to validate the data gathered on their respective NCCAP accomplishments. \n# \nThe CCC is currently revisiting the NCCAP, which will articulate the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). In June, the CCC hosted a regional training workshop on the development of NAPs, composed of technical experts from 28 Asian countries and conducted by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat, as a capacity-building exercise towards integrated cross-sectoral planning for climate change adaptation. The CCC organized a UNFCCC event on the designations of NAP Champions during the 23rd Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP23) in Bonn, Germany. Senator Loren Legarda was designated as a Champion along with Ms. Fekitamoela Katoa, Utoikamanu of Tonga. \n# \nWith the Philippines' accession to the Paris Agreement, a total of 15 consultations, discussions, validation meetings and workshops on the NDC sectoral targets were organized to discuss adaptation and mitigation options for the agriculture, waste, industry, transportation, forestry, and energy sectors. An initial draft of the NDC document has been formulated as well. \n# \nOn the climate change research and development agenda, the CCC had consolidated research and studies on several sectors such as settlements, industry, agriculture, energy, forestry, biodiversity, and natural resources, coastal and marines resources, water, health, transportation and communications. \n\nChair of the Senate Committee on Climate Change Senator Loren Legarda reiterates call to transform and decarbonize economie! to pursue a path of development aligned with the Paris Agreement ambitions and needs of our people."

Themed “Linking Science, Policy, and Practice for Climate and Disaster Resilience,”the first NPTE forum discussed what being a signatory to the Paris Agreement entailsparticularly, on understanding the climate goal of 1.5 degrees and our pursuit of attaining climate justice. The second NPTE Forum, themed \"Strengthening Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) and Services in the Philippines\" highlighted MHEWS as the new standards to effectively deal with risk and uncertainties to increase the resilience of communities. \n# \nUnder the Climate Change Budget Tagging initiative, the CCC and DBM jointly carried out the assessment of allocated budgets for climate actions of NGAs and LGUs. Based on the 2017 Climate Budget Tagging analysis, 43 NGAS have tagged their budgets for 6,307 (6,093 of which belong to DPWHP) programs, activities, and projects. $95\\%$ of which have been identified as adaptation actions, while $5\\%$ fall under mitigation actions. The budget allocation for adaptation actions increased by $23.81\\%$ (from PhP157.4B in FY2016 to PhP194.9B in FY2017). Mitigation actions decreased by $48.12\\%$ in budget allocation (from PhP18.6B in FY2016 to PhP9.6B in FY2017). \n\nMembers of the National Panel of Technical Experts (NPTE) underscore the need to utilize scientific researches in addressing impacts of climate change, with emphasis on the 1.5 global temperature limit of the Paris Agreement, during the inaugural NPTE Forum in SMX Convention Center, Pasay City."

Moving forward, the CCC will develop a comprehensive policy framework, which will providebasis for executive or legislative action on energy policy reform. \nIn support of the full implementation of the Green Jobs Act of 2016, which requires the CCC to institutionalize a system of accreditation, the CCC, in coordination with the International Labour Organization (ILO), conducted four policy roundtable discussions to tackle pertinent issues in the operationalization of the law and explore potential inputs in the development of the country's NDC. \nWith the Philippines as one of the recipient countriesofthe Technology   Needs  Assessment (TNA) Project of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Commission, as implementing partner, held a consultative forum to present the results of the adaptation component of the TNA and solicit inputs for the mitigation component. \n\n\nTo advance mitigation strategies in the private sector, a Memorandum of Understanding with the Philippine Green Building Council (PHILGBC) waS forged. The National Housing Authority (NHA) serves as  the implementing agency  for the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) on greening social housing, and the PHILGBC for the NAMA on increasing the uptake of green buildings. The CcC serves as the overall coordinating body for the two NAMA proposals. These proposals will be submitted to the NAMA facility and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) for possible financing. Under the NAMA projects, a carbon metric tool training was held with stakeholders from government, civil society organizations, nongovernment organizations, the private sector, and the academe."

Aligned with this initiative, the Commission organized a special session entitled “Fostering Local Climate Action\" at the 2017 League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP) National Assembly in Manila. Local Chief Executives (LCEs) signed  their individual  Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP) Commitment Certificates pledging their support for improved risk governance. The CcC and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) presented these Certificates to President Rodrigo R. Duterte in a ceremonial turnover. \n\n\nThe CCC worked closely with the DILG Local Government Academy (LGA) and State Universities and Colleges (SUcs), to help ensure that all local government units (LGUs) adopt their respective LCCAPs. The CCC and DILG jointly held training workshops to engage SUCs in mentoring LGUs for the formulation and enhancement of their respective LCcAP. Over 300 representatives from SUCs, regional,  and provincial government offices were trained   to formulate an LCCAP using the enhanced LCCAP Guidebook. To put this LCCAP technical support network into a test, the CCC, Benguet State University (BSU), and the Provincial Government of Benguet conducted a writeshop for Benguet LGUs on enhancing  the LCCAP. The workshop produced revised LCCAPs, which were presented to the Provincial LGU Officers and the BSU Team of Coaches for evaluation."

Training workshops for 39 participating LGUs produced 27 entity-level GHGIs and four community-level GHGls. Similar to the conduct of GHGIs for LGUs, a GHGI Manual and toolkit specific for the private sector was produced. \nHeeding the directive of the President for agencies to look into climate change and its relation to food security, the CCC supported efforts of the Department of Agriculture and scaled-up Climate Information Services (CIS) and Climate-resiliency Field Schools (CrFS) in 17 partner municipalities. \nThe objective was to cover more stakeholders in the CRFS, strengthen the CIS work of the LGUs, and raise awareness among LGU officials and farmers on climate action. At least 45 barangays with a total of 577 enrollees from 13 LGUs were covered by the CrFS intensive and special learning sessions. The CCC will continue this initiative through a peer-to-peer learning exchange program, sharing the experience of the Municipality of Dumangas, loilo as a model of good practice. \nAligned with the CCC's objective to develop a mainstreaming framework for indigenous peoples (IP) and climate change resilience, five case studies were conducted to compile indigenous knowledge systems and assess the needs and vulnerabilities of the following groups: 1) IPs of the Liguasan Marsh Areas, 2) Sierra Madre Dumagat Tribe, 3) Tribu Karulanos of Kabankalan City, 4) Cajidiocan of Romblon, and 5) IPs of Mt.
