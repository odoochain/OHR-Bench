Directions: Shaded upper box is a description of what is required; the lower box contains questions to be answered. \nA. Evidence of Effectiveness (Limit 2 pages) The proposal will be evaluated based on the extent to which you are able to clearly and specifically show your program's evidence of effectiveness and/or medical accuracy to at least two or more of the indicators listed below. Please cite all sources of evidence. If yours is a newly developed program, you will not have a record of effectiveness to draw upon. We will weigh heavily the indicators in Part B. Offerors must provide evidence of effectiveness and/or medical accuracy that fall into at least two or more of the categories below in order to be approved. \nIntormation is provided below showing evidence of effectiveness in Categories 1 and 2. \n1. Provide evidence that your program has a positive impact on students' ability to gain to make health-enhancing decisions that are age and developmentally and apply skills information to develop positive attitudes, behaviors and skills necessary responsibly for a lifetime (Cite available research studies). \n# \nThe Reducing the Risk curriculum is one of the first rigorously evaluated sex education curricula to have a measurable impact upon behavior (Kirby et al., 1991). It was the first to be evaluated in a high school setting and to have employed such methodological advances as large sample sizes, good comparison/control groups and long-term follow-up. \nIn the original study, Reducing the Risk was evaluated in 13 high schools throughout California.   \nForty-six classrooms were assigned to either program or comparison groups. \n# \nQuestionnaires measuring knowledge, peer norms, behavioral intentions, sexual and contraceptive behaviors and parent/child communication were administered to these students before the curriculum was implemented, immediately after the curriculum was implemented, about 6 months later and about 18 months later. A total of 758 students were tracked for 18 months. \n# \nResults indicated that Reducing the Risk: \nSignificantly increased knowledge. Students retained this greater knowledge for at least 18 months.   \nIncreased parent/child communication about abstinence and contraception, and made this communication easier.   \nSignificantly reduced the onset of intercourse at 18 months among students who had not initiated intercourse prior to the pretest.   \nIncreased use of contraceptives among students who did initiate intercourse after the curriculum was implemented. Significantly reduced unprotected intercourse among all students who had not initiated intercourse at pretest. These effects extended across a variety of sub-groups, including at least 2 different ethnic groups, both sexes, and lower- and higher-risk youth, but the curriculum was particularly effective for lower-risk youth and female students.   \nDid not diminish students' perceived proportions of students their age who had ever had sex, but did apparently prevent those perceptions from becoming worse.   \nSignificantly increased contraceptive use among female and among lower-risk youth over the comparison group."

It found that RTR both delayed the initiation of sex among those youth who had not had sex at pretest, and increased condom use among those youth who did initiate sex. The second study evaluated the impact of RTR in Kentucky (Zimmerman et al., 2008). It found that RTR significantly delayed the initiation of sex.

In addition, we have over 30 years of experience providing technical assistance and training to funded grantees, both regionally and nationally, in the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based programs in several large school districts and Prevention. \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nETR is well versed in the content areas being addressed by this RFP as well as general and evaluation-related services and capacity building. We have the experience of customizing pre and post test to measure how change in knowledge, skills, attitude and behavior for sex-related evidence based programs. In addition, for many years we have worked with teachers and schools to assist in understanding and maximizing the use of our evaluation services and findings. For example, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Adolescent and School Heaith (DASH) contracted with ETR Associates to provide rapid evaluation technical assistance to agencies implementing innovative heaith programs. In our work for the California Office of Family Planning,we have developed a continuous program improvement tool kit and provide evaluation support (e.g.. through serving as evaluation liaisons and providing training) to over 1o0 funded health agencies. In both projects,TA has included assistance in the development of customized evaluation plans, data collection, data analysis and synthesis, and dissemination of findings. ETR is currently one of three contracted agencies funded by the federal Family Youth and Services Bureau to provide program and evaluation technical assistance to states funded under the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP). This project has included the development and implementation of evaluationrelated webinars and training sessions. Furthermore, we are currently funded through CDC, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), Capacity-Building Branch to provide capacity-building assistance to local CDC-funded community-based organizations implementing HIV/AIDS prevention programs as well to other CDC-funded capacity-building agencies.

Many of the questions in the Reducing the Risk Student Knowledge Survey originate from published studies. The language used in some of the questions and/or response options has been modified from the original versions. Some questions have been newly developed for inclusion in this instrument. Please note that these measures may not prove to have adequate reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change for your students and should be pilot tested with your population and setting before use. \nEven though ETR does not typically work on projects that require developing an individual timetable to track student's achievements and goals, we do have substantial experience in evaluation and monitoring student progress.
